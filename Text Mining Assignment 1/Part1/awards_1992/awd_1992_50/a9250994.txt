Abstract    :
              The aim of this project is to change how undergraduates learn                  
              biological structure, by changing from an emphasis on                          
              presenting the histological structure of vertebrates to an                     
              emphasis on learning to analyze and interpret structure. The                   
              Microanatomy course at the University of Richmond will                         
              emphasize three approaches to science education.  (1)                          
              Collaborative Inquiry: Student teams will learn the structure                  
              and function of selected tissues by pursuing their own                         
              investigations using light microscopy, and transmission and                    
              scanning electron microscopy.  (2) Quantitative Analysis:                      
              Students will analyze their specimens morphometrically.  (3)                   
              Technological Competence: Light microscopes capable of Kohler                  
              illumination and phase contrast optics will be purchased to                    
              train students in analytical light microscopy.  Macintosh                      
              computers, monochrome and color video cameras, and an image                    
              scanner will be purchased to capture images from light and                     
              electron microscopes.  Students will then use software to                      
              quantitatively analyze and reconstruct images, and to present                  
              their data.
