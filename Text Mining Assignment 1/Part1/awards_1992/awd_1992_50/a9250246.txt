Abstract    :
              Upper-division physiology and neurobiology courses have been                   
              redesigned to integrate methodologies introduced at the                        
              beginning level under a previous ILI grant with senior level                   
              independent research. Laboratory design features critical                      
              thinking, problem solving and research skills.  Computer                       
              equipment and systems for monitoring intra and extracellular                   
              action potentials engage students in the process of scientific                 
              inquiry and prepare them for in-depth exploration of a research                
              project during their senior year.
