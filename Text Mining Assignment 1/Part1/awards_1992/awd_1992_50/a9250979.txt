Abstract    :
              Physics Pathways - Initial Step is the first phase of a five-                  
              year initiative in the Department of Physics at North Carolina                 
              State University to improve and extend opportunities for                       
              students in lower-division physics courses to learn in a                       
              technologically rich environment.                                              
              This Initial Step is expanding the existing program of teaching                
              problem solving in physics using interactive courseware                        
              (Physics 1 and 2) from 50 students per semester to 1,000                       
              students per semester.  By networking 50 IBM student                           
              workstations and installing a curriculum manager, we are able                  
              to offer a one student-one computer learning environment for                   
              large service courses.                                                         
              In addition, the expanded PCIC facility is being used twice per                
              semester to assess and monitor the development of basic                        
              laboratory skills such as error analysis, significant figures,                 
              and curve fitting.                                                             
              The Physics Pathways program, when fully operational, will                     
              offer choices to students for how they wish to learn.  This                    
              Initial Step is helping to initiate the scaling up of both the                 
              quality and number of microcomputers available for teaching                    
              large numbers of students.                                                     
              The problems being attacked by this project are common to many                 
              large universities.  If Physics Pathways - Initial Step is                     
              successful, the model we are developing will be transferrable                  
              to other settings.
