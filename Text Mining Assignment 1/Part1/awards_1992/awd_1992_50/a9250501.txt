Abstract    :
              The Chemistry Department is purchasing a modern Fourier                        
              Transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer to catalyze a major                     
              revision of laboratory and lecture courses in all of the                       
              sciences.  This instrument is used to introduce basic                          
              spectrometry to students, particularly those in teacher                        
              education programs, who presently are not exposed to this type                 
              of analysis.  At the upper division level, the instrument                      
              allows for fast, simple, and highly accurate analysis of a                     
              variety of processes and compounds.  Courses affected include                  
              general, inorganic, organic, and physical chemistry; as well as                
              courses in instrumental and chemical analysis, and introductory                
              physics.  As part of the Department's ongoing involvement in                   
              local pre-college education, the instrument provides for                       
              workshops and advanced laboratory experiences for both teachers                
              and their students, and the development of new approaches to                   
              teaching science in middle and high schools.
