Abstract    :
              Five new experiments on three topics--muon magnetic moment and                 
              lifetime, precision laser spectroscopy, and macroscopic quantum                
              effects: quantized Hall effect, Josephson effects and the flux                 
              quantum--are being developed to revitalize the upper-level                     
              undergraduate physics laboratories.  In these experiments                      
              students explore very general concepts, demonstrate important                  
              phenomena, measure several fundamental constants, and learn                    
              experimental techniques using modern instruments in three areas                
              of physics.  Because of continual funding constraints over the                 
              past 20 years, the upper-level labs at the University of                       
              Virginia have degenerated, and there has been a corresponding                  
              decline in student interest and participation in them.  The                    
              experiments are a part of a major effort to revitalize these                   
              labs so that they become again one of the most stimulating and                 
              informative parts of the curriculum.  When the project is                      
              completed, the experiments could be adapted for use at many                    
              institutions.  This equipment will have a dramatic impact on                   
              our undergraduate program for several reasons:  (1) The revised                
              curriculum initiated this fall will again have essentially all                 
              of the more than 40 third and fourth year physics majors taking                
              the labs for at least three semesters; (2) in the summer the                   
              equipment will serve undergraduate students participating in                   
              the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program; (3)                 
              with the completion of a 20,000 sq. ft. addition to the physics                
              building in the spring of 1992, the department has doubled the                 
              space designated for the upper-level labs; and (4) there is an                 
              increase in the number of physics majors that correlates with                  
              aggressive new efforts by the University to recruit                            
              undergraduate students with unusual ability in science.
