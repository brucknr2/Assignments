Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is purchasing computing equipment                  
              and software to incorporate computational chemistry throughout                 
              the undergraduate curriculum.  General chemistry students are                  
              using the workstations to examine bonding and structure of                     
              simple molecules, while in organic chemistry the energy                        
              differences between the various possible molecular                             
              conformations are calculated calculated.  The equipment is used                
              in physical chemistry to study ab-initio and semi-empirical                    
              methods.  Expansion of the types of projects available to                      
              students for independent study is also occuring as a result of                 
              the increased computional capabilities.
