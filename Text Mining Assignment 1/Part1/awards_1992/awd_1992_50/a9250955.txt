Abstract    :
              Central Michigan University is developing a new sophomore-                     
              junior level undergraduate inorganic lecture-laboratory course                 
              focussing on synthesis and characterization.  The availability                 
              of the newly acquired automatic polarimeter, Evans magnetic                    
              susceptibility balance, and high temperature box furnace make                  
              it possible for undergraduates to: study of optical isomerism                  
              in transition metal complexes; determine of magnetic moments of                
              complexes; and, the synthesis and characterization of solids.                  
              The equipment is also being used by students conducting                        
              undergraduate research.
