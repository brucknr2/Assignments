Abstract    :
              The Department of Earth Sciences is purchasing a                               
              spectroradiometer, ground penetrating radar equipment, and                     
              other related equipment for use in a field methods course in                   
              environmental geology.  In this course, students obtain                        
              essential hands-on experience with representative equipment and                
              techniques used in environmental field work.  Subsurface                       
              interface radar is used for mapping subsurface features.                       
              Surface-truth data from spectroradiometer analyses supports                    
              interpretation of remotely sensed images.  Water quality                       
              studies are done with portable water analysis laboratories.  A                 
              gas vapor soil probe and organic vapor meter are used for                      
              investigations of possible hydrocarbon leaks.  This equipment                  
              also provides important learning opportunities for many                        
              students in other courses through equipment demonstrations and                 
              direct participation.
