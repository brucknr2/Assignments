Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is acquiring equipment which                       
              functions as a signal processing module and is being used to                   
              teach students in upper level courses how to interface                         
              computers to instruments found in the typical research or                      
              industrial chemistry laboratory.  The equipment includes a                     
              function generator, spectrum analyzer, variable bandwidth                      
              preamplifier, lock-in amplifier, boxcar integrator, and various                
              pieces of software and small accessories.  The purpose of this                 
              project is to assure that graduating chemistry majors have                     
              hands-on experience with and knowledge of the major means by                   
              which signals from various chemistry lab experiments and                       
              apparatus are conditioned, amplified, and interfaced to                        
              computers.  The students also are learning how to use a                        
              computer to drive external experiments and are being taught the                
              operating principles behind Fourier transform and equivalent                   
              digital signal processing techniques which are now ubiquitous                  
              in modern chemistry labs.  The skills which the students are                   
              learning are being used in their undergraduate research                        
              projects.
