Abstract    :
              A UV/VIS scanning spectrophotometer is being purchased for use                 
              primarily by introductory chemistry students.  General                         
              chemistry students are learning to conduct spectrophotometric                  
              quantitative analyses, spectral analysis, kinetic assays,                      
              computer controlled operations, and computer database                          
              investigations.  The instrument is used by students in organic                 
              chemistry to study geometric isomerism and reaction mechanisms.
