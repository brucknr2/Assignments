Abstract    :
              Software modules are being developed which will improve student                
              learning in undergraduate major and service statistics courses.                
               With these modules,  students can use modern commercial                       
              statistical software and computing equipment to analyze                        
              realistic data.  The data analysis assignments will enable                     
              students to master the mechanics of data analysis and the                      
              important concepts that are introduced in these courses.  This                 
              is particularly so for concepts that require visualizing in                    
              more than two or three dimensions (e.g., multiple regression                   
              surfaces) or that require theory beyond the mathematical                       
              abilities of the students (e.g., large-sample approximate                      
              sampling distributions).  By using modern computing technology,                
              the students will become more actively involved in the learning                
              of important statistical concepts.  The learning experience can                
              be enhanced by giving students additional statistical                          
              experiences by using combinations of carefully designed and                    
              implemented multiple simulations and high-resolution dynamic                   
              graphics to illustrate key ideas.
