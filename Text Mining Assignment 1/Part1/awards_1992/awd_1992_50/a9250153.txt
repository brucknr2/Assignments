Abstract    :
              The department of Chemistry is  acquiring a high-field nuclear                 
              magnetic resonance spectrometer to improve undergraduate                       
              laboratory courses by providing each chemistry student with                    
              experience in operating the spectrometer in several laboratory                 
              courses.  Among the experiments being conducted with the aid of                
              this instrument are: the synthesis of C60 (buckminsterfullerene)               
              and the identification of this molecule by 13C and 1H NMR in                   
              general chemistry; spin dynamic studies incorporating the                      
              measurement of the 1H T1 time of water in paramagnetic solution                
              to obtain the magnetic moment of the paramagnetic species in                   
              physical chemistry; and, determination of the rate of ring                     
              inversion in cyclohexane using a chemical exchange technique.                  
              The instrument is also being used extensively in undergraduate                 
              research projects.
