Abstract    :
              The aim of this project is to establish eight computer-based                   
              physiologically oriented instrumentation systems in the                        
              laboratory section of introductory biology courses (both major                 
              and non-major oriented).  Laboratory exercises are designed to                 
              foster understanding of the scientific method and encourage                    
              critical thinking.  Students are guided to consider accuracy,                  
              sensitivity and precision when using the equipment.                            
              Experiments to be performed include such student controlled                    
              exercises as a comparison of changes in student resting and                    
              exercising heart rates among smokers and non-smokers, and males                
              and females.***//
