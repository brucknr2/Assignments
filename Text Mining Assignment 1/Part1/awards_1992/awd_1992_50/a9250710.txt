Abstract    :
              The Chemistry Department is purchasing a Fourier Transform                     
              infrared spectrometer (FTIR) to improve intermediate and                       
              advanced laboratory instruction and to enhance undergraduate                   
              research capabilities.  In the instrumental analysis course,                   
              students study the quantitative capabilities of FTIR                           
              spectrometry by determining the amount of carbon monoxide in                   
              automobile exhaust.  In the organic chemistry course, they                     
              conduct computer-based spectral searches of an unknown alcohol,                
              aldehyde or ketone.  In the physical chemistry course they                     
              observe and measure isotope and quantum statistical effects in                 
              the rotational fine structure of diatomic and some polyatomic                  
              gases.  Undergraduate research projects involving structure                    
              determination and the study of complex samples, such as                        
              polymers and films, are also carried out.
