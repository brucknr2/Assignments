Abstract    :
              The Geology Department is purchasing equipment for use in an                   
              atomic absorption laboratory.  This facility significantly                     
              improves the training of students in various geochemistry and                  
              hydrogeology courses in the undergraduate curriculum.  In                      
              courses in hydrology and environmental geochemistry, students                  
              learn to use this equipment as part of comprehensive water                     
              sampling and analysis projects.  Students in mineralogy,                       
              petrology, and geochemistry courses make use of this instrument                
              in the analysis of rocks and minerals; these analyses                          
              complement existing equipment (electron microprobe and x-ray                   
              diffractometer).  Students in lower-level courses, and in                      
              related upper-level courses, benefit from demonstrations and/or                
              supervised use in limited laboratory projects.  In addition,                   
              this equipment is made available for student research related                  
              to independent study and Senior Thesis projects, and is                        
              available to students in other departments through cooperation                 
              with CMU's interdepartmental Water Studies Center.
