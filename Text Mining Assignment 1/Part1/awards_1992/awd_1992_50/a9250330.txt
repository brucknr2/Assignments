Abstract    :
              The Behavioral Sciences Computer Laboratory is designed to                     
              provide students in the undergraduate behavioral science course                
              sequence at Union College with the computer hardware and                       
              software necessary to develop statistical analysis and research                
              methodological skills.  The project will establish a facility                  
              with a networked cluster of fifteen computer workstations. In                  
              addition to formal laboratory exercises, the facility will also                
              support student-selected independent research projects.  This                  
              project provides students with access to modern computer                       
              equipment and greatly enhances their educational and career                    
              opportunities.
