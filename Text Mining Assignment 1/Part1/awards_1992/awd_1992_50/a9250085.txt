Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Mary Hardin-Baylor will initiate a three-week,               
              commuter Young Scholars project in the fields of Chemistry and                 
              Physics for 30 students entering grade 9.                                      
                                                                                             
              The selected students will participate in hands-on science                     
              activities involving chemical analysis and measurements,                       
              environmental chemistry, polymer science, lasers, holography, and              
              investigations of the properties of light.  Activities have been               
              selected that are both exciting and educational.  Participants will            
              be divided into small groups to conduct a short research project.              
              A portion of the three-week workshop will involve career awareness             
              activities such as question and answer sessions with visiting                  
              scientists and engineers and field trips.                                      
                                                                                             
              The nine monthly follow-up activities will involve hands-on science            
              activities, dynamic speakers, field trips, and competitive events.
