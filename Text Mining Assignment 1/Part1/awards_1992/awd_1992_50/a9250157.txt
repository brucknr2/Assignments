Abstract    :
              The study of molecular asymmetry is being incorporated into the                
              laboratory curriculum at four different levels: in the first                   
              semester introductory organic laboratory, students resolve                     
              optical isomers and prove chirality and measure optical purity                 
              using a polarimeter; during the second semester they synthesize                
              secondary alcohols in enantiomeric excess and determine the                    
              isomeric ratios; in the advanced instrumental laboratories,                    
              enantiomers are resolved on a chiral HPLC column using the                     
              polarimeter as an HPLC detector;  the chiral synthesis of (+)-                 
              disparlure, the Gypsy moth pheromone, is performed in an                       
              advanced organic laboratory.  This equipment is also                           
              significantly enhancing undergraduate research in chiral                       
              synthesis.
