Abstract    :
              The goal of the project is to improve the instructional                        
              laboratory experience of intermediate-level undergraduate                      
              majors in preparation for additional experience in upper-level                 
              laboratories, independent research projects in faculty                         
              laboratories, graduate school, and employment.  This course                    
              offers students an integrated, quarter-long experience in                      
              modern biochemistry using an experiment with taq polymerase, a                 
              DNA polymerase from Thermus aquaticus which is used widely in                  
              polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology. The continuity and                 
              integrated format in this exercise will give students a more                   
              complete understanding of how to organize and perform a complex                
              series of tasks to achieve a final end-product, lay the                        
              intellectual framework of experimentation for other courses                    
              where more advanced experiments are performed, and give the                    
              students insight into the importance of standards and into                     
              their competence ln the laboratory. Finally, using their taq                   
              polymerase product in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system                 
              designed for criminal apprehension will help students connect                  
              the abstractness of biochemistry to the world in which they                    
              live.
