Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics at Chadron State College is                      
              establishing a computer/calculator laboratory which is                         
              facilitating a shift from teacher-centered to learner-centered                 
              instruction. They are currently implementing the Purdue                        
              University approach to teaching differential and integral                      
              Calculus, a cooperative-learning approach that relies heavily                  
              on computers and mathematical software.  In this project the                   
              department is adapting the Purdue approach to the pre-calculus                 
              sequence, a move that requires significant use of technology                   
              for course delivery.  Because of the department's strong cross-                
              curricular and service components, approximately 600                           
              enrollments per semester are being impacted by the project.  In                
              addition, workshops are being offered for inservice teachers                   
              thus impacting the public schools as well.
