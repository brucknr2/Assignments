Abstract    :
              The CSULA Department of Physics has initiated a new approach to                
              upper-division laboratory instruction by developing an                         
              integrated sequence of four courses.  The key feature of this                  
              program is that the students utilize skills learned in computer                
              interfacing and experimental methods to design and assemble the                
              apparatus they will use for a final independent experiment on                  
              the optical properties of thin film semiconductors.  Our goal                  
              is that each undergraduate develops laboratory literacy in the                 
              skills that they will need in order to be able to work                         
              independently on research projects in either industry or                       
              graduate school.  This project provides equipment for a major                  
              experiment in this program.  Interfacing equipment such as                     
              stepper motor controllers, IEEE and A/D converters allow                       
              students in the first two courses to determine experimental                    
              parameters and design control and acquisition programs.  The                   
              spectrometer, power supplies, lock-in amplifiers and deposition                
              rate monitor allow students in the following two courses                       
              optically to analyze thin film semiconductor samples using the                 
              data control and analysis systems determined in the first                      
              courses.  A previous pilot project has indicated the potential                 
              success of this method.
