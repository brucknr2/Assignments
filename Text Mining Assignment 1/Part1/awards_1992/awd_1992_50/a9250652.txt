Abstract    :
              The Department of Geography at the University of Connecticut is                
              developing a geographic information science lab for improving                  
              the quality of instruction in the undergraduate program.  This                 
              project will integrate geographic information science and                      
              technology into each level of the undergraduate curriculum.                    
              The educational goal is an evolution of skill development so                   
              that students receive a thorough understanding of concepts and                 
              models in geography that are enhanced and extended by the new                  
              technologies of geographic information systems.  By first                      
              introducing students to these topics in pre-major courses, it                  
              is hoped that they can be intellectually stimulated and                        
              attracted to geography as a social and physical science; by                    
              incorporating further instruction in the core requirements of                  
              the major, it is hoped that all students graduating from the                   
              program will have a minimum proficiency in the new                             
              technologies; and, by having further reinforcement in advanced                 
              level courses it is expected that students could use the new                   
              technology easily in their chosen areas of topical expertise.
