Abstract    :
              Innovative and improved investigations with the computerized HP                
              8452 UV/VIS spectrophotometer system (HP SPECTRO) in plant                     
              biology enable students to: 1) study and compare absorption                    
              spectra of different biological molecules;  2) evaluate rates                  
              of reactions through the automated features of the instrument;                 
              3) store, retrieve, and extrapolate data acquired; 4) take                     
              advantage of time saved to pursue additional spectrophotometric                
              investigations;  5) use a state-of-the-art instrument to obtain                
              real data for understanding biological phenomena;  and 6)                      
              obtain expertise in operation of a modern biological                           
              instrument.  Classes using this instrumentation include: Plant                 
              Biology (required for all biology majors), Plant Physiology,                   
              Plant Anatomy, and Individual Study.
