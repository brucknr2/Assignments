Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This grant supports the continuation of the teacher                            
              enhancement project of The Teachers Academy for Mathematics                    
              and Science in Chicago.  Elementary schools in the city of                     
              Chicago are participating in this school-wide program which                    
              provides meaningful in-service to every teacher, K-8, from a                   
              participating school. These teachers come to the Academy for                   
              an Intensive Program for two days per week every week for                      
              sixteen weeks.  Cooperating teachers replace these                             
              participants during their absence from the classroom.                          
              Implementation Specialists remain in the school for a year                     
              following the Intensive Program to provide resource help and                   
              information for the teachers. Since the schools in Chicago                     
              are mandated to have a Local School Council (LSC) to manage                    
              the learning and teaching environment, the LSC and the                         
              school administration must choose to participate in the                        
              program and accept the responsibility of continuing and                        
              ongoing support for it. This project has been designed to                      
              complement the education reform in the city.  The Academy                      
              staff and curriculum reflect the philosophy of experiential                    
              science and mathematics that is consistent with current                        
              literature. The project has supported 29 schools and over                      
              400 teachers to effect these changes in their schools.  This                   
              grant will enable an expansion of that effort.                                 
                                                                                             
              The project is also being funded by the Department of                          
              Energy, the city of Chicago, the state of Illinois and by                      
              private foundations and industry.
