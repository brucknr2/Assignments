Abstract    :
              This project provides a laboratory to accompany a two semester                 
              course in Electromagnetics.  This course, in general, is highly                
              mathematical and abstract.  Students are required to                           
              mathematically generate and analyze electromagnetic fields.                    
              The laboratory will allow the students to use dedicated                        
              experimental setups and instrumentation to analyze                             
              electromagnetic fields and related phenomena and compare with                  
              mathematical models.  Undergraduate students will experience                   
              the complete cycle of design, fabrication, and measurement of                  
              microwave instruments through computer aided data acquisition.                 
              The development and improvement project utilizes state-of-the-                 
              art microwave measurement and signal generation equipment for                  
              the observation and analysis of various aspects and                            
              applications of electromagnetic fields.  The goal is to give                   
              the seniors a hands-on experience with different concepts of                   
              microwaves and electromagnetic fields and the project corrects                 
              a serious deficiency in the laboratory hardware.
