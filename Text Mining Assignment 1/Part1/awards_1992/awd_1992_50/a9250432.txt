Abstract    :
              This proposal will introduce fourier transform infrared                        
              spectroscopy in course-related laboratories and in the required                
              student research program.  To accomplish this goal, a Mattson                  
              GL-5022 FTIR will be purchased.  The instrument will be                        
              configured with an MCT detector to allow kinetic studies to be                 
              performed, and will provide a spectral range of 6000cm-1 to                    
              400cm-1 with a resolution of 0.75cm-1.  The instrument will                    
              include capabilities in diffuse reflectance and photoacoustic                  
              measurements.  It will be used for instruction in principles                   
              and applications of FTIR in the physical, advanced inorganic,                  
              biophysical, and advanced organic course sequences.
