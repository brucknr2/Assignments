Abstract    :
              The goal of the project is to improve the cell and molecular                   
              biology curriculum at the Department of Biology at Central                     
              Michigan University, The project will  (1) develop a hands-on,                 
              instrument-based, course in microscopy;  (2) improve the                       
              quality and effectiveness of laboratories in existing courses                  
              in Cell Biology, Molecular Biology, Methods in Molecular                       
              Biology, and Electron Microscopy for a strongly research                       
              oriented undergraduate program.  The equipment requested                       
              includes high quality light microscopes equipped with optics                   
              and accessories designed with multiple applications of                         
              brightfield, phase, polarizing, DIC and epifluorescence, and a                 
              state-of-the-art image processing and analysis system.  These                  
              new microscopes and one existing transmission and two scanning                 
              electron microscopes, one of which is equipped for x-ray (EDS),                
              will interface, by film and video, with the image processor.                   
              Bench-type laboratory courses and activities which expose                      
              students to the practical use of instrumentation in real                       
              experimental situations will use this integrated imaging                       
              system.
