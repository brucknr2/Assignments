Abstract    :
              Through the application of digital audio technology, a new                     
              microcomputer-based laboratory will expose psychology students                 
              and speech pathology and audiology students to the fundamentals                
              of acoustics, sound propagation, distortion, time-domain and                   
              frequency-domain representation of sound, sound spectrograms,                  
              resonance and the format structure of the human voice, the                     
              source-filter theory of speech production, categorical                         
              perception of speech and non-speech stimuli, fused and                         
              segregated perceptual images, multidimensional scaling, and                    
              associated topics.  The laboratory will employ an active hands-                
              on approach, so that students will acquire a firm understanding                
              of the relationship between the physical properties of sound                   
              and sound production on one hand, and the perceptual                           
              consequence of changes in stimulation on the other.  Both                      
              major- and non-major upper-division undergraduate students will                
              utilize this laboratory .
