Abstract    :
              The Geological and Geophysical Sciences Department is                          
              configuring and adapting newly developed portable digital                      
              seismometers (PASSCAL) for use in a variety of undergraduate                   
              laboratory experiences ranging from introductory laboratory to                 
              upperclass laboratory to Junior and Senior Independent Work                    
              (thesis).  Five portable three-channel systems are being used                  
              to deploy small (<500m) arrays of geophones in one or two                      
              dimensions, and with at least one three-component seismometer                  
              for study of shear waves.  Students are using the equipment in:                
              1)a local array for study of small earthquakes (active region);                
              2) a local linear array for refraction or reflection studies;                  
              3) a engineering seismology demonstration of tomography; 4) a                  
              engineering seismology demonstration of building resonances;                   
              and 5) seismic station operations for earthquake monitoring.                   
              Each deployment mode is suitable for introductory labs,                        
              upperclass labs, or upperclass research, depending on the                      
              extent to which the students are given independent                             
              responsibility for conduct of the work.
