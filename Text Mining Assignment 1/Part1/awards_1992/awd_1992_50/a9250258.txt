Abstract    :
              It is the intent of this project to help prepare scientifically                
              literate citizens by improving the scientific education of non-                
              science majors (with a specific focus on elementary education                  
              majors) enrolled in an introductory physics course (Physics                    
              100).  A Laboratory/Lecture format for this course is already                  
              in place which encourages students to learn physics first by                   
              doing experiments and then developing these concepts through                   
              lectures and discussions.  To address the difficulty that many                 
              of these students are not particularly adept at using                          
              mathematics, the general pattern recognition required to move                  
              from the concrete experiment to the abstract principle is                      
              developed through graphing.  This approach has been well                       
              accepted; however there are two difficulties: 1) graphing                      
              significant amounts of data can become tedious, causing                        
              students to become weary of the process and the science                        
              involved;  and 2) gathering sufficient data to gain insight                    
              into systems through the use of the scientific method can be                   
              extremely time consuming.  These two difficulties can be                       
              overcome by computerizing the laboratory.  Data can be plotted                 
              and revised expeditiously using a computer.  Using probes                      
              interfaced to the computer, significant amounts of data can be                 
              collected rapidly.  These data can then be easily plotted.                     
              Thus, greater emphasis can be placed on the science with less                  
              energy expended on technical details.  More time can be spent                  
              discerning the patterns of nature and exploring their                          
              implications.
