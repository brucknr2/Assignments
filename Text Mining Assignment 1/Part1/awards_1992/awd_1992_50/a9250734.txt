Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is acquiring a gas chromatograph-                  
              mass spectrometry to instruct students in the qualitative and                  
              quantitative analysis of samples at nanogram to picogram                       
              levels.  The equipment is being used in organic chemistry,                     
              analytical chemistry, instrumental analysis courses, as well as                
              for student research.  Among the new experiments being                         
              introduced in the organic chemistry laboratory is the                          
              identification of the products resulting from photolysis                       
              reactions occuring in zeolite cavities.  The instrumentation is                
              also enabling the development of a new course for the analysis                 
              of drugs and pesticide residues in the food chain.  Students                   
              engaged in independent research projects are benefiting from                   
              the availability of the equipment.
