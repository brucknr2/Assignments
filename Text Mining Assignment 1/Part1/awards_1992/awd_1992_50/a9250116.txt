Abstract    :
                    The research will suppose that R is a commutative two-                   
              dimensional Noetherian ring.  The primary projects in this proposal            
              are:  (1) characterize the partially ordered set of prime ideals for           
              various examples of such rings; and  (2) suppose that the ring R               
              has the additional property that there exist only finitely many                
              finitely generated indecomposable R-modules up to local                        
              isomorphism.  Describe the indecomposable modules of R.                        
                    This work in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry                  
              will examine the lattice structure of the set of prime ideals in the           
              Noetherian ring.                                                               
                    The project furthers VPW program objectives to provide                   
              opportunities for women to advance their careers in science or                 
              engineering through research, and to encourage other women to                  
              pursue careers in these areas through the investigator's enhanced              
              visibility as a role model on the host campus.  The proposed                   
              activities which contribute to the second objective include:  short            
              visits by other prominent women mathematicians; meetings with                  
              women graduate students in mathematics; teaching courses and                   
              participating in seminars.
