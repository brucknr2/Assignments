Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a gas                                
              chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) for use in the upper                   
              level undergraduate chemistry laboratories.  The acquisition of                
              the GC/MS is enabling undergraduates to:  (1) receive hands-on                 
              experience with this powerful and widely used technique;                       
              and,(2) investigate  a range of sampling procedures,                           
              instrumental variables, quantitation methods, and data                         
              analysis.  The instrument is also being used by students                       
              engaged in undergraduate research.
