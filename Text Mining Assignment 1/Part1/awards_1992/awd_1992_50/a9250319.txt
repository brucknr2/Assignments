Abstract    :
              The project focuses on the use of microcomputers and related                   
              equipment in the expansion of a three-phase curricular program                 
              in sociology, that addresses the special needs of non-                         
              traditional undergraduate students many of whom are women.                     
              Phase I is designed for the large introductory course, and                     
              employs Microcase/Showcase Presentational software to                          
              demonstrate actual research in a lecture format  thus enabling                 
              us to link the introductory lectures to future hands-on                        
              laboratory experience.  In Phase II, we will address problems                  
              of math and computer phobia with group projects using                          
              simplified software for quantitative analysis.   By Phase III,                 
              students will have had repeated experiences in posing                          
              sociological questions and bringing data to bear on them.  In                  
              this phase, students will integrate the diverse elements of                    
              their course work into a coherent and mature conception of                     
              sociology through their senior projects.
