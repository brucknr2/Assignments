Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is developing a series of                          
              experiments for first year students based upon the spiral                      
              approach to learning.  The spectroscopic methods include both                  
              colorimetry and infrared spectroscopy.  Initially the students                 
              construct a simple LED based colorimeter, experiment with the                  
              color of the LED, etc., and use it in the determination of the                 
              concentration of a copper (II) salt in an unknown.  In parallel                
              fashion, a simple infrared spectrometer (IR LED) is being used                 
              to determine the percentage of ethanol in an unknown.  In the                  
              second tier, the colorimeter is used to determine the                          
              composition of cupric carboxylates and their Ksp.  In the third                
              tier, the equilibrium constant for the hydrogen-bonding of                     
              alcohols with bases is determined via the use of a commercial                  
              infrared spectrophotometer .  Finally, the students interface                  
              the colorimeter to a computer and then determine the rate of                   
              bromination of acetone.
