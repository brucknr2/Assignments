Abstract    :
              This investigation will both experimental and numerical.                        
                                                                                            
              The objectives of the proposed research are as follow:                         
                                                                                             
              1) Experimental Investigations (These are divided into                         
                two parts).                                                                  
                                                                                             
                    a)    Experimental investigation of double-                              
                          diffusive convection in a static V-shaped                          
                          sump during the binary system solidification                       
                          process.                                                           
                                                                                             
                    b)    Experimental investigation of double-                              
                          diffusive convection during the continuous                         
                          casting process.                                                   
                                                                                             
              2) As far as the numerical investigation is concerned,                         
                this section is also divided into two parts.                                 
                                                                                             
                    a)    Development of mathematical modeling and                           
                          refinement.                                                        
                                                                                             
                    b)    Numerical study of the continuous casting                          
                          process.  The specific objectives are to                           
                          obtain velocity, temperature, concentration                        
                          distribution, and the evaluation of the                            
                          solid liquid interface in the cases cited                          
                          for which rigorous experimental and                                
                          numerically results are not available, and                         
                          to present correlations, tables and graphs                         
                          for use in industrial applications.  It is                         
                          believed that the availability of accurate                         
                          experimental/numerical results for these                           
                          fundamental problems is important from an                          
                          academic and practical point of view and                           
                          that they will further enhance research in                         
                          these area.
