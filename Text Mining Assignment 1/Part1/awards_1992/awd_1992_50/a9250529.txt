Abstract    :
              This proposal requests matching funds for the purchase of NeXT                 
              computers and software to establish a Mathematica-Based                        
              Calculus laboratory for use beginning Fall 1992.  The                          
              successful completion of this project will provide the                         
              following to other institutions:  (1) A model for full                         
              implementation of a Calculus laboratory program.  (2) A                        
              successful model for intradepartmental "bootstrap"                             
              dissemination of Calculus Reform.  (3) A collection of                         
              laboratory modules that can be used with any Calculus textbook,                
              and in any Mathematica-Based Calculus laboratory.  (4)                         
              Improvements to Mathemtica for use in Calculus laboratories,                   
              including increased flexibility of syntax and a much improved                  
              plotting command.
