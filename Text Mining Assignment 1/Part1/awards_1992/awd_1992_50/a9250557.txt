Abstract    :
              Students in the Department of Marine Engineering at Texas A and                
              M in Galveston are being introduced to state-of-the-art neural                 
              networks and adaptive methods in their control courses and                     
              laboratories.  Microprocessor-based controllers and models of                  
              ship equipment are controlled by feed-forward neural network                   
              algorithms in the newly funded laboratory.  Novel features of                  
              this project are the adoption of optimal (Nlsp type) neural                    
              networks (i.e., networks which require the smallest number of                  
              arithmetic operations to propagate from input to output), and                  
              learning algorithms which guarantee convergence to an optimal                  
              solution.  The equipment is used in ship design projects at all                
              stages of the Integrated Learning System Program of the Marine                 
              Engineering Department, emphasizing intelligent control and                    
              automation.
