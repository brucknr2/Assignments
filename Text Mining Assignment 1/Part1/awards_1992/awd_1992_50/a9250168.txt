Abstract    :
              A Quality Engineering Laboratory enhances undergraduate Quality                
              Control courses in the Department of Industrial Engineering at                 
              Kansas State University.  The laboratory covers both, Product                  
              Design and Statistical Process Control.  Students are                          
              responsible for proper selection of components for the best                    
              possible design that meets the functional requirements.  Off-                  
              line quality engineering and its influence on product quality                  
              is demonstrated through hands-on laboratory experiments.  In                   
              addition, students implement statistical process control                       
              techniques in a model production facility with two multi-                      
              station production lines after they have learned the underlying                
              principles which include how quality control techniques relate                 
              to Computer Integrated Manufacturing.
