Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              We propose to continue to develop and explore the                              
              enhancement of student learning of science through an                          
              emphasis on student research.  Key to the success of this                      
              approach are technologies including: student field stations                    
              using low-cost MBL field monitors, probes, and instruments;                    
              experimental growth chambers; and software tools.  Building                    
              on materials and technology developed so far in the project,                   
              we plan a careful evaluation and continued development of                      
              our approach in a two-year field test starting September,                      
              1992.  The data this yields about the role of the                              
              technologies and strategies employed will answer important                     
              questions about the power and feasibility of our approach.                     
                                                                                             
              The major components of our instructional strategy are to:                     
              1) focus on global ecology; 2) establish school research                       
              stations with increasing technological capacity; 3) offer                      
              students and teachers a suite of observations and                              
              experiments in global ecology that can be easily                               
              implemented; 4) foster the development of student research                     
              skills: and 5) create a community of student researchers                       
              knit together through telecomputing and other shared                           
              experiences.  Our work in this phase of the Global Lab                         
              project will concentrate on supporting and evaluating the                      
              field test, developing technologies that fill gaps in our                      
              ability to offer experimental global ecology, developing                       
              supporting curricula material, and creating teacher support                    
              strategies.
