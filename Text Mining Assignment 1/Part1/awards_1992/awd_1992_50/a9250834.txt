Abstract    :
              This project introduces biochemical engineering unit operations                
              into the Lafayette College curriculum.  Three groups of                        
              students are affected.  All chemical engineering students learn                
              to operate a computer controlled bioreactor in their dynamic                   
              design course.  Those chemical engineering majors interested in                
              biochemical engineering as a career can perform sequential                     
              experiments on all unit operations common in the biotechnology                 
              industry, from growing cells in the bioreactor, to measuring                   
              product formation and enzyme kinetics, to separation and                       
              purification of the final product.  Liberal Arts students are                  
              introduced to the intriguing combination of biology and                        
              technology by performing simple experiments in an                              
              interdisciplinary course.  One of the goals of the project for                 
              chemical engineering students--a substantial number of whom go                 
              on to careers in medicine, biomedical engineering, and the                     
              pharmaceutical industry--is for them to have the opportunity                   
              for hands-on experience with equipment and techniques they are                 
              sure to encounter in their professional endeavors.
