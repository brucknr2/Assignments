Abstract    :
                   This proposal, from the California State University                       
              Chancellor's Office and the University of Pittsburgh, seeks to                 
              establish a grant program for underwriting participation by                    
              community colleges in the 1992 Chautauqua Teleconference Course,               
              Increasing Minority Participation in Math-Based Disciplines.                   
                   The course will be given by Uri Triesman, Department of                   
              Mathematics, University of Texas, Austin and the Dana Center for               
              Mathematics Education, U.C. Berkeley.  Increasing Minority                     
              Participation In Math-Based Disciplines will be produced by                    
              University Extension Services, California State University, Long               
              Beach and will be distributed live, by direct satellite                        
              transmission to reception sites across the country.                            
                   Emerging Scholars Programs have had a dramatic effect on the              
              performance and retention of underrepresented minority students in             
              freshman calculus courses.  The program encourages a team approach.            
              Using satellite technology to distribute the program live allows               
              for participation by man instructors and administrators at one                 
              site, at a cost much lower than would be incurred if the                       
              participants and Course Directors traveled to regional sites.                  
              Satellite distribution also allows greater numbers to participate              
              in the course to learn about and implement strategies for                      
              incorporating the successful Emerging Scholars Programs at their               
              home institutions.//
