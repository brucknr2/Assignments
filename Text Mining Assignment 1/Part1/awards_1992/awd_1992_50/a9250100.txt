Abstract    :
              The Political Science Department of The Ohio State University                  
              in conjunction with the American Political Science Association                 
              is conducting a three-week summer (1992) workshop on the                       
              teaching and research applications of statistical data                         
              analysis.  The general objective is to enhance the instruction                 
              of undergraduates in the research practices of political                       
              scientists with access to a large variety of individual and                    
              aggregate, citizen and leader data on political and related                    
              phenomena.  This includes data on a number of democratic                       
              nations, international relations, elections of members of state                
              legislators, voting in the U.S. Congress, presidential                         
              elections, and the U.S. Supreme Court.  The American Political                 
              Science Association is assisting this project by assuring                      
              access to the workshop, evaluating its effectiveness and                       
              impact, and disseminating its instructional strategies and                     
              materials to all political science faculty.
