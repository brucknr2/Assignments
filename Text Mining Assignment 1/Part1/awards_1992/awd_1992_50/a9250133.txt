Abstract    :
              This project improves the undergraduate education in Civil                     
              Engineering through implementation of two new laboratory                       
              experiences, in which Non-Destructive Test (NDT) methods are                   
              applied to Steel and Reinforced Concrete structures.  Civil                    
              Engineers must understand the capabilities and limitations of                  
              NDT techniques in order to undertake the rehabilitation of the                 
              United States' aging infrastructure.In the Steel NDT laboratory                
              experience, weld quality and the location of cracks will be                    
              explored using fluorescent penetrant, magnetic particles, and                  
              ultrasonics; all of this equipment will be acquired through                    
              this proposal.  In the Reinforced Concrete NDT laboratory                      
              experience, the location of reinforcement and flaws, and the                   
              concrete integrity will be investigated using impulse radar, a                 
              Schmidt hammer, and an ultrasonic pulse meter.   A new high                    
              frequency (1 GHz) antenna will be acquired for the radar system                
              and five Schmidt hammers will be obtained.The NDT laboratories                 
              will significantly improve the quality of Clarkson's Civil                     
              Engineering education by giving approximately 100 students a                   
              year the opportunity to use state-of-the-art NDT equipment in                  
              hands-on laboratories.
