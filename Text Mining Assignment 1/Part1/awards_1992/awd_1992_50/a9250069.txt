              "Maine:  A Community of Discovery" will change fundamentally                   
              opportunities, performances, and aspirations in mathematics                    
              and science for all of Maine's students, pre-school through                    
              college.  Educational, political, business, and community                      
              leaders joined in the initiative to coordinate changes in:                     
                                                                                             
              1.   Curriculum.

              3.   Teacher enhancement programs.                                             
                                                                                             
              4.   Alignment of curricular goals with assessment.                            
                                                                                             
              The vehicles for change will include Beacon Schools, schools                   
              selected to be laboratories for testing new curriculum                         
              materials and teaching methods and, later, as models and                       
              dissemination centers for all schools in Maine.  Fourteen                      
              mathematics and science facilitators will be responsible for                   
              dissemination of instructional materials, methods, and                         
              technology developed at the Beacon Schools.  At the                            
              postsecondary level, Maine will establish a Beacon College,                    
              a consortium of institutions of higher education that will                     
              reform their teacher preparation programs consistent with                      
              the Beacon Schools' needs.  In addition, the State will                        
              mount community awareness programs, progressive institutes                     
              and workshops for teachers, and efforts to increase the use                    
              of technology.  Mathematicians and scientists will                             
              participate throughout the project's components.
