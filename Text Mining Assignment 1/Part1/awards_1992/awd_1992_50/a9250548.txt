Abstract    :
              At Passaic County Community College, Anatomy and Physiology is                 
              the most heavily enrolled science course.  It is required for                  
              most Biology programs and all Allied Health programs.  The                     
              proposal requests funds to upgrade the laboratory component of                 
              the course by acquiring computer-based physiological equipment.                
               Five complete workstations will be established, each equipped                 
              with a personal computer, printer and Intelitool sensors and                   
              interfaces.  The equipment will permit students to perform                     
              hands-on experiments in electrocardiography, spirometry, muscle                
              physiology and reflex physiology.  The project is designed to                  
              increase scientific interest within the general student                        
              population and improve the scientific competencies of those                    
              students intending to pursue a career in science.
