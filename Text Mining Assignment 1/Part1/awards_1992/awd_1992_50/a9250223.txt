Abstract    :
              This project provides the Computer Science Laboratory with                     
              increased strengths in UNIX, data communications, graphics, and                
              basic computer power.  In acquiring state-of-the-art UNIX                      
              workstations, students will be provided with graphic                           
              interface/windowing platforms and an opportunity to stay on the                
              main sequence of UNIX development, as well as greater                          
              capabilities in Internet communications, network file systems,                 
              and object oriented programming.  The acquisitions in data                     
              communications will allow students year-round access to a                      
              Novell network and a distributed database management system, as                
              well as opportunities to perform commercial programming in a                   
              network environment using both database and Novell application                 
              programming interfaces.  The system will be utilized by both                   
              computer science and chemistry majors.  Chemistry majors will                  
              be able to investigate computational chemistry, e.g., molecular                
              modeling, of nontrivial molecules plus subsequent                              
              visualization; computer science majors will utilize the system                 
              throughout their curriculum, in courses including data                         
              structures, digital communications, database management, and                   
              operating systems.
