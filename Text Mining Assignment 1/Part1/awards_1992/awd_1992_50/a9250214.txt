Abstract    :
              This project will equip the polymers and coatings laboratory                   
              with instrumentation for modern thermal analysis.  The                         
              Chemistry Department has developed a new undergraduate polymers                
              and coatings concentration in the chemistry major, including                   
              two new polymer laboratory courses and several new lecture                     
              courses.  The instrumentation will be used routinely by all                    
              students in the concentration to characterize the polymers they                
              synthesize, perform testing on these polymers, and conduct                     
              research on new polymeric materials.  This instrumentation will                
              also be used by advanced undergraduates from the Materials                     
              Engineering Department in several materials testing and                        
              analysis laboratory courses and in undergraduate research.  A                  
              combination of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and                     
              thermal mechanical analysis (TMA) will be used so that all                     
              types of polymers and coatings can be investigated.
