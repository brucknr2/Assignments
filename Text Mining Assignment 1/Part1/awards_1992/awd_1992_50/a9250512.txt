Abstract    :
              Students at Pitzer, a liberal arts college, are studying                       
              mathematics presented in a manner that relates to real-world                   
              situations that interest them. Three non-traditional                           
              mathematics courses are being designed to be attractive to                     
              students who may have limited previous exposure to college-                    
              level mathematics.  Major portions of these courses involve                    
              students interacting with computer workstations which are                      
              allowing them to directly control the elements of mathematical                 
              phenomena and immediately visualize the result.  Through these                 
              interactions, students are gaining an understanding of                         
              mathematics and how it relates to the world around them.  The                  
              computer hardware and software are providing a learning                        
              laboratory at a college where mathematical studies are often                   
              something many students have learned to avoid and where                        
              computers are frequently only associated with word processing.                 
              The immediate goal is to revitalize the relationship students                  
              feel with mathematical studies.  The ultimate goal is to alter                 
              some of the misconceptions that may exist about what is an                     
              appropriate mathematical education for liberal arts college                    
              students.
