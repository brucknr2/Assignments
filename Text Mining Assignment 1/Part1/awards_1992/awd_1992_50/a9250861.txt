Abstract    :
              This project integrates cell culture into team-taught, cross-                  
              disciplinary courses in Biology and Chemistry.  Three                          
              functional groups of equipment are used: tissue culture                        
              equipment (a CO2 incubator), immunology and biochemistry                       
              equipment (tabletop centrifuges, fraction collectors and a                     
              microplate reader), and microscopy equipment (a low light level                
              video camera and printer to establish a florescent video                       
              imaging system).  Equipment in all three groups supports                       
              innovative laboratory exercises in new or revised courses in                   
              Immunology, Biochemistry, Cell Biology and Molecular Genetics.                 
              This instrumentation also supports student/faculty  research                   
              teams in both biology and chemistry.
