              The Virginia Quality Education in Science and Technology (V-                   
              QUEST) will extend two major state efforts already underway,                   
              the department of education's "World Class Education", an                      
              ambitious ten-year plan to define learning outcomes for all                    
              students and "Workforce 2000", a blue-ribbon panel report to                   
              the governor that calls for a scientific and technologically                   
              literate citizenry.                                                            
                                                                                             
              The project will focus on improving mathematics and science                    
              education in grades K - 8.  Virginia conducted an extensive

              Action Council, and ten Local Action Councils to create a                      
              management structure that links content (through the                           
              components) with a process (State and Local Action Councils)                   
              for local involvement.
