Abstract    :
              A series of hands-on laboratory exercises are being developed                  
              for a triad of upper-division physics courses based on the                     
              techniques of active optical spectroscopy of gases and plasmas                 
              using a tunable dye laser as probing light source.  The                        
              laboratories give students hands-on experience in operating and                
              calibrating a dye laser system and teach various ways in which                 
              we can use scanning, narrowband dye lasers in the spectroscopic                
              study of matter.  Four core exercises are being developed                      
              initially, with gradual extensions and additional exercises                    
              being added as independent research projects conducted by                      
              senior physics majors.  The following form the initial four                    
              core exercises:  (1) An Introduction to Dye Lasers and                         
              Calibration;  (2) Investigation of Atomic Structure by Laser                   
              Optogalvanic Spectroscopy;  (3) Spectroscopic Study of                         
              Molecular Structure by Laser Induced Fluorescence and by Laser                 
              Absorption;  and (4) Optical Diagnosis of Electrostatic Waves                  
              in Plasma.  Emphasis is placed on hands-on student                             
              participation and the full utilization of current state-of-the-                
              art active spectroscopy apparatus and procedures as provided by                
              frequency scanning, narrowband dye lasers and supporting                       
              optical components and instrumentation for signal analysis.
