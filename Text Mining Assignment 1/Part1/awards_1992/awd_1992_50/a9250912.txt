Abstract    :
              Two new interdisciplinary courses which make use of a                          
              fluorescence spectrophotometer are being developed.  One of                    
              these is a year-long laboratory course designed to provide                     
              students with experience in biochemistry, molecular biology,                   
              and cell biology; the second is a biophysical measurements                     
              course designed to encourage student understanding of                          
              instrumental methods of measuring the molecular parameters                     
              governing all biological processes.  The fluorometer is also                   
              being used for experiments  involving organic, analytical,                     
              natural products, physical measurements, and instrumental                      
              analysis.  Undergraduate research projects involving the study                 
              of the structure and function of myosin, a contractile protein,                
              and other multidisciplinary undergraduate research projects                    
              involving faculty from the chemistry and biology departments,                  
              make use of the fluorometer.
