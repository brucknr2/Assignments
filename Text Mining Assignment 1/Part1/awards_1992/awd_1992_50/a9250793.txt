Abstract    :
              The object-oriented paradigm (OOP) is having a significant                     
              effect on software development and use.  Through this project,                 
              Lawrence University will integrate OOP into a core of four                     
              introductory and intermediate computer science offerings taken                 
              by the math/computer science majors and other students who                     
              choose to supplement their major with a strong background in                   
              computer science.  A key to this integration is switching from                 
              Pascal to C++ as the programming language used in these                        
              courses.  By providing students early exposure to object-                      
              oriented programming, instructing them how to make the most                    
              effective use of programming tools, exposing them to issues in                 
              abstraction and portability, and teaching them how to use                      
              already developed code libraries, the project will insure that                 
              the students' growth in computer science is in step with the                   
              most recent trends in the discipline.  To assist in achieving                  
              these goals, through this project the institution will acquire                 
              workstations which support a rich C++ environment for                          
              developing and using class libraries.
