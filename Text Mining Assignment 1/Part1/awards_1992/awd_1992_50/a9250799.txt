Abstract    :
              The Chemistry Department of Drew University will incorporate a                 
              200 MHz NMR spectrometer with 1H, 13C and variable temperature                 
              capabilities as a major step in enhancing the chemistry                        
              curriculum.  Laboratory experiments, including original ones in                
              catalytic decarbonylation, stereochemistry, and cisplatin                      
              binding, will be introduced to illustrate the use of NMR as an                 
              essential tool in structural analysis, determination of                        
              physical measurements, and modern techniques of data                           
              manipulation.  Acquisition of this instrument will also have a                 
              significant impact on our program of undergraduate research;                   
              student publications are expected to increase substantially.
