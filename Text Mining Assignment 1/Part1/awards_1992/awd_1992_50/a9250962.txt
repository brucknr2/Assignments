Abstract    :
              The goal of the project is to introduce more hands-on                          
              laboratory activity in the areas of ecology and plant science.                 
              The study of the causes for variation in organisms is a                        
              fundamental aspect of ecology and an essential step for                        
              understanding the process of natural selection. Students will                  
              conduct experiments in which they evaluate the causes for                      
              biological variation.  These causes are either environmental or                
              genetic variation, or a combination of each.  Biochemical                      
              traits, such as enzyme activity, vary much like other aspects                  
              of organisms but can be measured accurately and quantitatively.                
              Students will raise given strains of bacteria, plants and                      
              insects in two different set of environmental conditions, and                  
              different strains or subpopulations in a given environmental                   
              condition using water baths, plant growth chambers and                         
              biological incubators. Spectrophometry is used to assay the                    
              activity of specific biochemical systems from each organism.                   
              When students find that enzyme variation has a significant                     
              genetic component, an additional evaluation of protein                         
              polymorphism is conducted by means of protein electrophoresis.
