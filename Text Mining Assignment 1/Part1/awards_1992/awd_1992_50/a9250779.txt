Abstract    :
              This project enhances the undergraduate Instrumental Analysis                  
              course by focusing it on practical electronics and data                        
              acquisition techniques that apply to real research problems.                   
              Inexpensive modular instruments will allow students to perform                 
              sophisticated experiments with apparatus that is partially                     
              constructed during the laboratory.  Use of lasers and computer                 
              control of instrumentation, fast transient data acquisition,                   
              phase sensitive detection, and the use of optical detectors are                
              emphasized.  Experiments involve organic and inorganic                         
              photochemistry and spectroscopy, kinetics, and chemical                        
              physics.An independent, short research project requires the                    
              student to apply his or her training to an original problem.                   
              The project also improves the undergraduate Physical Chemistry                 
              laboratories.
