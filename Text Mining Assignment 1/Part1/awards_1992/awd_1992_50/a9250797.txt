Abstract    :
              Laboratory materials are being developed which allow students                  
              to use the computers and calculators as a classroom tool for                   
              exploration, visualization, and computation. This institution                  
              has a heavy enrollment in traditional mathematics courses below                
              the level of calculus as well as in courses designed to support                
              other majors, such as business and liberal arts. For the                       
              traditional precalculus sequence,  classroom sets of graphing                  
              calculators are being used to assist students in developing                    
              visualization skills and to better prepare them for calculus.                  
              For the service courses,  a computer classroom with appropriate                
              software allows students to focus on concepts and exploration                  
              rather than manipulation and arithmetic detail.
