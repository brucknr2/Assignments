Abstract    :
              Technology that can be used for wireless information networks                  
              is currently undergoing rapid development.  Among the many                     
              applications include indoor wireless local area networks (LAN)                 
              to provide for the portability and mobility of computer                        
              terminals and workstations, digital cellular mobile radio                      
              telephone networks to increase channel capacity over current                   
              narrowband analog FM cellular systems, and personal                            
              communication networks (PCN) where individual users operate                    
              pocket sized transceivers capable of making telephone calls                    
              using a fully mobile service whether they are at home, in the                  
              office, or on the street.This award will assist in funding a                   
              new senior level electrical engineering laboratory supporting                  
              studies of wireless information systems.  Topics to be                         
              addressed include pseudo-noise codes, direct sequence spread                   
              spectrum, frequency hopped signals, acquisition and tracking,                  
              CDMA wireless computer communications, UHF channel propagation                 
              characteristics including multipath time delay profiles and                    
              attenuation measurements, bit error rate measurements, and                     
              phase-locked loops.  In addition to formal weekly lab                          
              experiments, all students will be required to do a design                      
              project relating to wireless information networks, make oral                   
              presentations, and submit written reports.
