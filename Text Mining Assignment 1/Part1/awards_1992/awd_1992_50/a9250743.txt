Abstract    :
              Small groups of students design and implement their own                        
              experiments including presentation of a hypothesis, provision                  
              of a flow chart of the experimental plan, and generation and                   
              analysis of data.  Final results and conclusions are discussed                 
              by the entire class.  The focus is on cell compartmentalization                
              and DNA technologies. Equipment includes centrifuges and                       
              electrophoresis systems.
