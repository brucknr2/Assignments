Abstract    :
              The Department of Meteorology is purchasing equipment for                      
              advanced undergraduates to study the methods used in making                    
              mesoscale forecasts and short term severe weather forecasts and                
              warnings.  The equipment is providing students with hands-on                   
              experience in manipulating and enhancing real-time high-                       
              resolution observational data to required to forecast mesoscale                
              weather events.  Undergraduate are also using the new                          
              facilities for independent research studies in mesoscale                       
              meteorology.
