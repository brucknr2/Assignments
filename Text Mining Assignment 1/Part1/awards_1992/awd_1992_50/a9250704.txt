Abstract    :
              This project allows the development of condensed matter physics                
              experiments to be used in conjunction with the courses offered                 
              in the sophomore through senior years of the undergraduate                     
              physics curriculum.  The equipment is easy to use, flexible in                 
              its ability to support a wide variety of solid state physics                   
              experiments, and fairly free of maintenance.  The solid state                  
              physics laboratory utilizes two temperature control systems:                   
              (1) a home-made liquid nitrogen cryostat for experiments                       
              between 77 K and room temperature, and (2) a closed cycle                      
              liquid helium refrigerator for experiments between 10 K and                    
              room temperature.  The second, acquired for this project,                      
              allows for low temperature experiments without the need for                    
              purchasing, storing, and transferring liquid helium.  A                        
              laboratory computer system is used for experimental control,                   
              data acquisition, and data analysis in some of the more                        
              advanced experiments, and additional pieces of modern                          
              instrumentation are used to instrument fully the experiments.
