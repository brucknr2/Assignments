Abstract    :
              The project aim is to develop an undergraduate program in                      
              behavioral neuroscience with a strong emphasis on the                          
              development of critical thinking skills through participation                  
              in active learning experiences in the classroom and in faculty                 
              supervised student research.  The project will focus on three                  
              separate levels: introductory and advanced courses, and student                
              research, with the degree of training at each stage designed to                
              build upon the skills learned in earlier stages.  This program                 
              expects to encourage student initiated research in neuroscience                
              that asks original questions through experimentation.                          
              Instruments have been selected to introduce the skills                         
              necessary to utilize modern technology in neuroanatomy and                     
              neurophysiology.  Equipment is requested to develop skills in                  
              neuroanatomy (a cryostat and related histological equipment)                   
              and neurophysiology (including single and multiple unit                        
              recording apparatus).
