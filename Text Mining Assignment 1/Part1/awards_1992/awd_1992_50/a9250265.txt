Abstract    :
              This project is to build a High-Performance Computing and                      
              Software Laboratory in the Division of Mathematics, Computer                   
              Science, and Statistics at the University of Texas at San                      
              Antonio (UTSA).  This facility will support a variety of                       
              educational and research projects investigating both the                       
              fundamental nature of high-performance computing and its                       
              application to problems of importance in software engineering.                 
              Through the supporting laboratory facilities and different                     
              upper-division classes, students will be given an understanding                
              of high performance computing, training in use of appropriate                  
              machines, and an experimental environment in which to conduct                  
              research in high-performance computing.  A variety of systems                  
              will be studied including vector and multiprocessor                            
              supercomputers, such as the CRAY Y-MP (computing time is                       
              provided by the University of Texas System), different MIMD                    
              multiprocessor systems, such as the Intel iPSC HyperCube,                      
              Sequent Symmetry (computer time is provided by the Center for                  
              Research on Parallel Computing at Rice University), the BBN                    
              GP1000 at UTSA, and high-performance workstations.  The project                
              will concentrate on three important areas:  1) solving                         
              numerical problems in scientific applications by using high-                   
              performance computing systems;  2) measuring and evaluating                    
              performance of scientific computing on high-performance                        
              computing systems;  and 3) monitoring and visualizing the                      
              performance.  The laboratory facilities will support courses                   
              and research in numerical computation, visualization, software                 
              development and will encourage interdisciplinary work between                  
              computer science students and students from other fields of                    
              science and engineering.
