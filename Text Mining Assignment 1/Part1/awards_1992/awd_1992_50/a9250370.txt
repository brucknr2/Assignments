Abstract    :
              Distributed ProcessingThis project will contribute to a major                  
              modification of the computing environment for instruction in                   
              computer science at this institution.  The new equipment will                  
              replace a lab of terminals connected to an IBM 4381 mainframe                  
              by a distributed processing, resource sharing network of                       
              computer workstations.  Networking has fundamentally changed                   
              the structure of computational environments.  The client/server                
              model is critical to understanding current day hardware and                    
              software issues.  A shift in operating systems from MUSIC to                   
              UNIX will provide a real world computing environment with                      
              research and teaching software tools not previously available.                 
              Providing individual workstations will allow the students to                   
              experiment and investigate hardware and software issues not                    
              allowed on a multiuser mainframe system.  This equipment will                  
              serve as a model for computing environments for the entire                     
              state of Arkansas.
