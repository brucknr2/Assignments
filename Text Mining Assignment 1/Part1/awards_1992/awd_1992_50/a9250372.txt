Abstract    :
              Cooper Union's Mechanical Engineering Department will establish                 
              an enhanced undergraduate Acoustics Laboratory.  Acoustics and                
              vibration control is increasing in prominence among the                        
              engineering disciplines. Cooper Union's enhanced and expanded                  
              acoustics/vibrations lab will permit undergraduate hands-on                    
              experience with sound intensity probes and force hammers, as                   
              well as a greater understanding of the implications of random                  
              and sine sweeps of vibration generated by a shaker . Also, the                 
              concept of modal analysis of a structure undergoing vibration                  
              is clarified by the use of an accompanying modal analysis                      
              computer program.  An expanded acoustics/vibrations laboratory                 
              of this type provides undergraduate engineering students with                  
              deeper insight into the nature of the effects of oscillatory                   
              inputs, the means of measuring them and minimizing their                       
              negative consequences .
