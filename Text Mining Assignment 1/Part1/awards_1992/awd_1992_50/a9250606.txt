Abstract    :
              The Environmental Engineering Laboratory at Cooper Union is                    
              being improved for undergraduate instruction, experiments, and                 
              research projects with an upflow packed-bed bioreactor and                     
              other pilot and bench-top units.  The bioreactor and other                     
              pilot units are used in conjunction with mutant bacteria                       
              cultures to demonstrate and study their effectiveness and                      
              kinetics in treating industrial and/or toxic wastewaters and                   
              sludges.  The instruments and equipment are used for sampling,                 
              monitoring, and analyzing various quality parameters in the raw                
              and treated wastes, as well as studying their biodegradability                 
              and/or toxicity.  The Environmental Engineering Laboratory also                
              supports several undergraduate experimental projects per year,                 
              and is used for demonstration and instructional purposes in                    
              several Civil and Chemical Engineering Department courses.
