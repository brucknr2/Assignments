Abstract    :
              Northeastern University is creating a computer facility, the                   
              Math Excel Mentor Laboratory, to support the learning of                       
              mathematics.  The program Math Excel was inspired by a visit                   
              from Uri Triesmann and is loosely modeled on some of the other                 
              programs he has helped develop.  This program will employ some                 
              of its students as mentors in the Math Excel Mentor Laboratory.                
              The Math Excel Mentor Laboratory will serve two related                        
              purposes.  The first of these is to be a support laboratory for                
              sections of calculus, differential equations, and linear                       
              algebra.  Through the laboratory, students will explore ideas                  
              new to the curriculum.  The second purpose will be to provide                  
              an environment in which students help students explore                         
              mathematics creatively and make their own discoveries.  One                    
              aspect of this second purpose will be the creation of a                        
              supportive student culture of mathematical discovery.
