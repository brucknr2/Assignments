Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to establish a laboratory in                    
              physiological psychology.  This laboratory will provide upper-                 
              level undergraduates with the opportunity to learn first-hand                  
              the methods that enable researchers to bridge the gap between                  
              physiology and behavior.  The acquisition of neurosurgical,                    
              histological and behavioral equipment will allow students to                   
              engage in a variety of exercises which demonstrate the                         
              application of both modern and traditional techniques.  The                    
              establishment of this laboratory will improve the psychology                   
              curriculum by expanding current course offerings in upper-                     
              division laboratory courses.  In addition, the quality and                     
              quantity of independent student research projects will improve.
