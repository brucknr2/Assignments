Abstract    :
              This project involves the acquisition and installation of a                    
              computer-based instrumentation and control system in an Energy                 
              Conversion/Electric Power Systems Laboratory.  The system will                 
              be capable of direct data acquisition through A/D converters,                  
              data collection from other instruments over an IEEE-488 bus,                   
              and closed loop control of electric machines through variable                  
              speed drives.Using the computer for data collection relieves                   
              the student of the very time consuming and tedious chore of                    
              reading instruments and recording values.  The computer makes                  
              short work of the data analysis, and the student quickly sees                  
              the quality of the data.  A major goal of this project is to                   
              ensure that the student is not allowed to divorce                              
              herself/himself from the experiment.  The computer must enhance                
              the study of the concepts and be as transparent as possible.
