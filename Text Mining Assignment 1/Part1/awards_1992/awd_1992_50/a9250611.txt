Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics, Physical and Computer Sciences                  
              is acquiring work stations, each including a 80486 based                       
              computer and data acquisition equipment.  The laboratory is to                 
              be located in a specially configured room using the standard                   
              model of a science exploratorium and incorporating into it a                   
              strong mathematics component.  This exploratorium permits the                  
              offering of some paired sections of physics and calculus where                 
              the emphasis is on the study of physical phenomena.  The                       
              facility provides faculty the tools to present models and have                 
              students participate in making modifications thereto.  When                    
              used as an open lab, it gives students an area in close                        
              proximity to mentors and the necessary equipment for their work                
              on independent projects and assignments.  The configuration of                 
              the room enables an instructor to see all displays from the                    
              front and provides each student with individual computer space                 
              and work space.  Further, the exploratorium provides a place in                
              which to demonstrate the on-going curriculum changes to full                   
              time department members and to the numerous adjunct faculty.
