Abstract    :
              An advanced laboratory course in Cellular and Molecular                        
              Neuroscience introduces cellular and molecular neuroscience                    
              laboratory into the curriculum, a new field of concentration at                
              the undergraduate level.  Laboratory exercises focus on                        
              experimental design rather than on techniques per se.  Students                
              explore current concepts of cellular and molecular neuro-                      
              biological research in three different tissues: cardiac,                       
              neuronal and skeletal.  Techniques explored include tissue                     
              culture, receptor binding analysis, molecular biology including                
              northern blots, and microscopic analysis of specific cells.                    
              The equipment is also integrated into related courses in the                   
              Biology Department and used by students for undergraduate                      
              research projects.
