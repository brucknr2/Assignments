Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a high performance                   
              liquid chromatograph and ultracentrifuge for use in a                          
              collaborative project between students enrolled in organic                     
              chemistry, biochemistry, and instrumental analysis.  Organic                   
              chemistry students prepare acetanilide and three deriatives,                   
              and determine the appropriate HPLC conditions for their                        
              separation; students in biochemistry study the hydroxylation of                
              acetanilide by rat liver microsomes using the developed HPLC                   
              conditions to determine the relative amounts of the various                    
              isomers produced; finally, the instrumental analysis students                  
              conduct a structural analysis via the technique of gas                         
              chromatography/mass spectrometery.  The project demonstrates                   
              the interrelationships between chemistry subdisciplines and the                
              need for cooperation among scientists with expertise in                        
              different areas.
