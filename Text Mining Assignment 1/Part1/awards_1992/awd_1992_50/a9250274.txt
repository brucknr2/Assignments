Abstract    :
              Chemical and mechanical engineering students at Cooper Union                   
              are involved in an interdisciplinary laser laboratory where                    
              they learn fundamental and practical aspects of laser                          
              interaction with materials involving basic phenomena in                        
              chemical and mechanical engineering.  The laboratory                           
              experiments involve a medical laser to investigate aspects of                  
              laser use such as operating room fire safety.  The laser                       
              laboratory experiments expose engineering undergraduates to                    
              seemingly unrelated fields, such as laser surgery, combustion                  
              science, anesthetic practice, and materials engineering.  In                   
              addition to biomedical applications, the laboratory experiments                
              demonstrate basic principles of fluid mechanics,                               
              thermodynamics, heat and mass transfer, chemical kinetics,                     
              physical chemistry, and combustion.  In addition to the medical                
              laser, other equipment used in the experiments include a flow                  
              control center, a video system, and a computer system for data                 
              acquisition and control.
