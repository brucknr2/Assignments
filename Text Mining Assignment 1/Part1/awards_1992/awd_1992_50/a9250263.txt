Abstract    :
              This project involves the acquisition of a Siemens X-Ray                       
              Diffractometer system and associated equipment to complete the                 
              development of a state-of-the-art facility in x-ray diffraction                
              and electron optical methods which are non-destructive                         
              techniques commonly used in the characterization of structure,                 
              physical state, stress, and texture of materials.  This project                
              will significantly enhance the materials analysis capabilities                 
              of the undergraduate laboratory.  Experiments have been                        
              developed which highlight basic principles such as phase                       
              diagram determination of alloys, phase characterization of                     
              superconducting oxides, texture development, and analysis of                   
              cold worked and annealed metals, phase analysis of corroded                    
              materials and corrosion by-products, amorphous materials,                      
              polymers and composites, and laser melted metals.  The                         
              equipment will be used by a total of 1,465 students per year.                  
              The laboratory will be the only such facility in the entire                    
              campus and will also serve as a regional center for faculty and                
              students from smaller colleges and junior colleges.
