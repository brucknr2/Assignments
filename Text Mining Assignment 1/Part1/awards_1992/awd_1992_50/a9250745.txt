Abstract    :
              In upper-level courses students are introduced to advanced                     
              microscopy skills such as phase and differential interference                  
              contrast and epifluorescent microscopy, photomicrography and                   
              computerized video image analysis.  Attention is paid to the                   
              repeated use of the same principles to deal with problems in a                 
              wide-ranging set of biology courses by each faculty member with                
              emphasis on quantification and investigative use of these                      
              microscopical tools.
