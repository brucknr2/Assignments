Abstract    :
              A course entitled Contemporary Mathematics in which students                   
              learn about new uses of mathematical developments by using                     
              microcomputers is being developed.  Students have the chance to                
              see the utility of mathematics by doing mathematics the way it                 
              is done in the real world.  The student audience includes                      
              liberal arts majors and education majors with an Intermediate                  
              Algebra background. Student experiences include the discovery                  
              method, cooperative learning groups, and an interactive                        
              approach. Students have the opportunity to ask what if                         
              questions, the ability to see geometric structures, and the                    
              ability to do
