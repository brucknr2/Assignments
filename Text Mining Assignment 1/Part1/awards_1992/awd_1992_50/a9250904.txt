Abstract    :
              This project encompasses the development of equipment and                      
              experiments for teaching the behavior of structures under                      
              dynamic loading conditions to undergraduate engineers.  The                    
              laboratory development augments the facilities available in an                 
              existing laboratory which is used to teach behavior of                         
              structures under static loads.  Tests begin with simple free                   
              vibration experiments demonstrating how dynamic parameters                     
              characterizing motion are measured, progressing through                        
              structures subjected to forced vibration caused by dynamic                     
              forces (e.g., wind loads) or base motion (e.g., by an                          
              earthquake), and application of vibration reduction techniques                 
              (e.g., by use of dampers and base isolators).  Small-scale                     
              structures will be used in most of the experiments, but in at                  
              least one experiment, the students will evaluate the dynamic                   
              performance of an existing prototype structure.  The overall                   
              objectives in conducting such tests include:  (1) enabling the                 
              student to understand dynamic structural behavior and related                  
              theories; (2) teaching the students the use of modern dynamic                  
              testing equipment and data acquisition facilities; and (3)                     
              serving as a motivational force and as a general enrichment of                 
              their educational experience.  Instruments will provide state-                 
              of-the-art experience and yet will be easy to use.  The                        
              experiments which can be performed are essentially unlimited                   
              and can be changed to meet changing curricular needs at no                     
              additional cost.
