Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is purchasing lasers,                              
              monochromators and associated equipment to introduce Raman                     
              spectroscopy, fluoresence and fast kinetics into the physical                  
              chemistry laboratory.  Among the experiments involving laser-                  
              induced phenomena that the students are performimg are: Raman                  
              spectroscopy in condensed phases, fluorescence spectroscopy in                 
              gases, and the determination of excited state lifetimes.  The                  
              equipment is also being used by students engaged in                            
              undergraduate research.
