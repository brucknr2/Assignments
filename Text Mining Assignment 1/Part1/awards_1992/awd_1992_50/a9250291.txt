Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a 200 MHz FT NMR                     
              spectrometer for use in its sophomore organic chemistry                        
              laboratory, as well as in other upper division courses within                  
              the department.  In the organic laboratory, students  produce                  
              spectra of reactants and/or products relating to standard                      
              experiments, then use the instrument to identify unknowns.  In                 
              the physical chemistry laboratory, students use the instrument                 
              in connection with reaction kinetics experiments and in                        
              studying reaction transition states.  In the biochemistry                      
              laboratory, students collect COSY spectra of dipeptides and                    
              follow the metabolism of C-13 labeled glucose in E. coli.  In                  
              the spectrometric methods course, students work independently                  
              on a variety of projects involving special techniques of FT-NMR                
              spectroscopy.
