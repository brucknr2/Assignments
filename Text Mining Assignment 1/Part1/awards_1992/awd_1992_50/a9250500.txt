Abstract    :
              A test data collection facility at the Microelectronic                         
              Engineering Department of the Rochester Institute of Technology                
              allows their semiconductor process engineering students to                     
              evaluate the quality of their designs and processing, manage                   
              yield improvements, and thoroughly analyze devices and                         
              processes from a statistical point of view.  The students, who                 
              fabricate thousands of devices and circuits in their                           
              undergraduate years, have now a semi-automatic wafer level                     
              probing capability to collect, analyze, and correlate orders of                
              magnitude more test data in the same amount of test time                       
              previously devoted to manual test procedures.  Tedious re-                     
              connections to various test instruments for test changeovers                   
              are being replaced by a flexible matrix switching system.  The                 
              quality of the design and fabrication processes can be                         
              determined only if appropriate metrics are obtained.  The                      
              results of automatic testing for defects in density structures,                
              devices, and circuits are considered in this laboratory and                    
              throughout the microelectronics curriculum.
