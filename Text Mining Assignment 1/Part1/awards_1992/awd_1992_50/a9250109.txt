Abstract    :
                    The area of research being proposed involves the                         
              management and exchange of the knowledge required to                           
              facilitate Concurrent Engineering (CE).  A large element of CE                 
              involves the integration of separate, specialized disciplines.                 
              Each engineering or business group has its own valuable                        
              knowledge that it uses to accomplish its task.  In a CE                        
              environment, the communication of this knowledge is of                         
              primary concern.                                                               
                    This project proposes investigation in the interaction,                  
              communication, and integration of specialized knowledge.                       
              Each body of specialized knowledge is viewed as a                              
              knowledge source, and it is of particular interest to                          
              understand, simplify, and formalize ways for sharing this                      
              engineering/business knowledge.                                                
                    The project furthers VPW program objectives to provide                   
              opportunities for women to advance their careers in science                    
              or engineering through research, and to encourage other                        
              women to pursue careers in these areas through the                             
              investigator's enhanced visibility as a role model on the host                 
              campus.  The proposed activities which contribute to the                       
              second objective include:  visiting five northeastern universities             
              to give technical seminars; leading a seminar series at the                    
              host institution, tentatively titled,  "Intelligent Systems in                 
              Manufacturing and Concurrent Engineering;" teaching one                        
              course per semester at the School of Industrial Engineering,                   
              namely, Computer Integrated Manufacturing, and Expert                          
              Systems; and mentoring students.
