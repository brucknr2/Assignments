Abstract    :
              This project is for the implementation of a laboratory of                      
              transputer-based multiprocessors in the department of computer                 
              science at Smith College.  The laboratory is to include a 32-                  
              transputer machine connected to eight 486 workstations. The                    
              department currently has no access to multiprocessor machines                  
              other than two transputer-based workstations. The creation of                  
              the laboratory will affect directly four classes currently                     
              taught in the department, and will allow the creation of a new                 
              class entirely dedicated to parallel processing.
