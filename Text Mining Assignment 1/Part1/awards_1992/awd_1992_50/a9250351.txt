Abstract    :
              A  Calculus Laboratory is being further developed featuring                    
              student projects with large experimental aspects. In addition,                 
              a Laboratory Manual is being created, tested, and revised. The                 
              manual will be published by a commercial publisher as a part of                
              the dissemination efforts.
