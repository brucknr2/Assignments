Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry's acquisition a 200 MHz fourier                    
              transform (FT) spectrometer is providing  undergraduate                        
              chemistry majors with training in modern nuclear magnetic                      
              resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.  The integrated instructional                    
              approach uses introductory experiments to introduce and                        
              reinforce the basic concepts and builds to advanced two-                       
              dimensional NMR projects.  Availability of the instrument is                   
              leading to the development of a new advanced undergraduate                     
              laboratory/lecture course focused entirely on multipulse and                   
              two-dimensional NMR. The undergraduate research program is also                
              benefitting from the new instrument.
