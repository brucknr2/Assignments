Abstract    :
              The goal of this program is to revise and improve the                          
              curriculum of the sophomore, junior and senior year physics                    
              laboratory courses through the introduction of the                             
              microcomputer.  The program will address the need perceived by                 
              the UMass/Boston Physics Department to provide training to                     
              students in the use of a computer in making physical                           
              measurements, an essential skill to be mastered by physicists                  
              in today's technological society.  By integrating computers                    
              into the laboratory environment students will receive a hands-                 
              on, intuitive feel for the computer as a powerful tool                         
              available to supplement their experimental work.  The                          
              University of Massachusetts at Boston was established with a                   
              mission to serve the urban areas of Boston.  Our student body                  
              has a high percentage of disadvantaged students who do not have                
              access to computers outside the university setting.                            
              Implementation of this program will provide them with the                      
              laboratory experience in computer use which is required for                    
              them to compete successfully upon graduation.
