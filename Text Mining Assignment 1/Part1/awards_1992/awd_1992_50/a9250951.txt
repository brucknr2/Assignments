Abstract    :
              A newly instituted undergraduate laboratory integrates                         
              molecular biological and computer technology in a format                       
              designed to simulate the research laboratory setting.  All                     
              experiments focus on a single eukaryotic gene, the UAR3 gene                   
              from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is isolated, amplified,                   
              sequenced and expressed under various conditions.  All                         
              laboratory exercises are accompanied by computer-based                         
              tutorials, which present fundamental principles of the lab                     
              exercises and then challenge the student to solve hypothetical                 
              problems using laboratory techniques.
