Abstract    :
              Computer equipment and videodisk stations expand an open-ended                 
              anatomy and physiology laboratory into a learning center                       
              designed to supplement classroom activities.  The facility is                  
              open and staffed from 9AM to 9PM Monday through Friday and 9AM                 
              to 5PM on Saturday.  Students use the stations to drill and                    
              test themselves on course material from a library of                           
              Hypercards.  In addition the stations are used for mastery                     
              based testing modes and for students and faculty to keep track                 
              of student progress. The center serves a large population of                   
              students with diverse backgrounds; students in the health                      
              sciences and education.This
