Abstract    :
              The aim of this project is to enhance the undergraduate science                
              experience in the life sciences at Fordham through the                         
              acquisition of a new transmission electron microscope (TEM).                   
              A new TEM will provide students in courses (Microbiology,                      
              Bacteriology, Histology, Microanatomy, Cell & Developmental                    
              Biology and Cell/Molecular Biology) with hands-on use of an                    
              instrument that provides fundamental information about cell                    
              structure and function. More than 50% of the target audience                   
              consists of women and a high proportion belong to                              
              underrepresented minority groups.  The new TEM will also                       
              provide expanded opportunities for these students to become                    
              directly involved in cell biology research.  In addition to                    
              serving undergraduates, a component of the project involves                    
              organizing electron microscopy workshops for two- and four-year                
              college faculty and AP high school teachers.
