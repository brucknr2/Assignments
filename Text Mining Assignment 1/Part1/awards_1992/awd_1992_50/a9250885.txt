Abstract    :
              Borough of Manhattan Community College is a large urban two-                   
              year college whose student body is two-third female, and over                  
              80% minority.  With a 1989-91 NSF Calculus Reform Grant they                   
              have succeeded in attracting and retaining more women and                      
              minorities in the Calculus sequence.  This was accomplished by                 
              adding computer-based collaborative workshops, based on the                    
              Treismann model, to Calculus I, II, and III.  It has become                    
              increasingly clear that to recruit and retain women and                        
              minorities the program must begin at an earlier level; so they                 
              are pushing their successful efforts back to the precalculus                   
              level.  With increased computer support they are attracting and                
              preparing more women and minorities for careers in mathematics,                
              science, and the technologies.
