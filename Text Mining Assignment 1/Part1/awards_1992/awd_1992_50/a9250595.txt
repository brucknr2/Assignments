Abstract    :
              An integral part of the current effort to completely overhaul                  
              the four-year undergraduate curriculum is the creation of a                    
              Virtual Laboratory, which integrates real-world                                
              experimentation, through the design and construction of                        
              electronic and digital systems, with theoretical and                           
              simulation-based analyses of the system being designed.  The                   
              laboratory experience accomplishes two important goals:  first,                
              it gives the student a feel for working with real hardware and                 
              creates an awareness of the discrepancies between theory and                   
              practice; second, it provides an opportunity for developing                    
              intuition that comes only through practice.  The laboratory                    
              includes PC equipment for data acquisition and real-time                       
              control, PC-based analysis and simulation capabilities, and                    
              network connections to allow further offline analysis outside                  
              of laboratory hours.
