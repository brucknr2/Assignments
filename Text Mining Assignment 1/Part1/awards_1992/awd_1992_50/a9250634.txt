Abstract    :
              A Radio Telescope for Advanced Astronomy Laboratory                            
              A radio telescope antenna is being equipped with a receiver                    
              capable of detecting the 21-cm emission from galactic neutral                  
              hydrogen.  A existing 10 foot paraboloid antenna formerly used                 
              for satellite communication at l.3-cm is used for the antenna.                 
              Using a modern receiver and low noise preamplifier, this                       
              antenna is able to detect and map the 21-cm line emission from                 
              the Milky Way disc to trace the rotation curve of the galaxy,                  
              and to measure the overall mass and distribution of the                        
              interstellar gas.  This telescope is incorporated into                         
              undergraduate laboratories to give students experience with                    
              radio spectroscopy and microwave equipment and techniques.  In                 
              addition, a new course, Advanced Astronomy Laboratory, uses the                
              telescope to give students the opportunity to do observational                 
              projects related to senior level astrophysics.  The radio                      
              telescope provides the tools needed for such projects.
