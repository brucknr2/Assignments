Abstract    :
              A new upper-level course in observational astronomy using an                   
              existing Celestron 14-inch telescope is being developed.  The                  
              observations cover a wide range of topics in modern astronomy.                 
              A CCD camera is used to obtain images of star clusters, HII                    
              regions, and galaxies as the basis for instruction in image                    
              processing.  Multicolor CCD photometry is done on an open                      
              cluster in order to plot the cluster's Hertzsprung Russell                     
              diagram.  CCD photometry is also done on short period variables                
              to determine their light curves.  Classification spectroscopy                  
              of stars is performed using a grating spectrograph with a low                  
              dispersion grating and film or the CCD camera.  High velocity                  
              spectroscopic binary stars are observed with a high dispersion                 
              grating and the CCD camera on the spectrograph to determine                    
              their orbital velocities.  The observations are possible with                  
              the inexpensive telescope because they are primarily based on                  
              bright objects, and because the telescope is automatically                     
              guided by a second CCD camera, already on the telescope.                       
              Students can pursue independent research projects on fainter                   
              objects with the same equipment.  Data obtained with the                       
              equipment is also used in the introductory astronomy course.
