Abstract    :
              A laboratory classroom and associated materials are being                      
              developed to permit upper division mathematics courses,                        
              including linear algebra, applied linear algebra, applied                      
              statistics, differential equations, and abstract algebra, to be                
              taught with a `project' orientation. Long term group and                       
              individual projects are being designed which push students                     
              beyond simple paper and pencil calculations. Students are                      
              learning to conceptualize graphically, numerically and                         
              symbolically; in addition, students are learning to read good                  
              mathematics textbooks, are learning some fundamentals by using                 
              pencil and paper, and are being helped along the way with short                
              lectures and demonstrations.
