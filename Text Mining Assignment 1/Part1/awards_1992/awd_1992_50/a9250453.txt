Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to complete the development of a                   
              two course sequence (Semiconductor Device Physics and                          
              Introduction to Microelectronics) which provide the foundation                 
              for semiconductor devices by adding a laboratory course which                  
              emphasizes test and characterization.  Upon completion of the                  
              present courses, the student has an understanding of the basic                 
              physics of pn junctions, bipolar transistors, and both junction                
              and metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors.  This                  
              new laboratory will provide the student with the tools required                
              to characterize and evaluate the performance of these devices.                 
              This will, in turn, provide the student with the basic test                    
              skills required to work effectively in industrial organizations                
              developing and manufacturing semiconductor devices and                         
              circuits.                                                                      
              The current laboratory lacks the capacitance voltage apparatus                 
              which is essential for the characterization of MOS based                       
              devices, which dominate present integrated circuit                             
              technologies.  With the equipment being acquired through this                  
              project, the development of the semiconductor device physics                   
              course sequence will be able to be completed.
