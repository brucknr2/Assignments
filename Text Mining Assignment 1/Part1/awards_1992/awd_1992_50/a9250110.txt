Abstract    :
              This research assesses the effect of learning resources (e.g.,                 
              presence of a local expert in a work group, information centers,               
              corporate-sponsored courses) on computer literacy.  The assessment             
              will be accomplished through a follow-up study of 30 of 89 work                
              groups studied in three waves from 1987 to 1989.  Computer literacy            
              was first assessed in these groups in late fall 1989, with the                 
              development of an instrument for measuring computer literacy.  The             
              main question now to be addressed is:  in work groups in which                 
              computer use is already well-established, will computer literacy of            
              the work group show an increase, decrease, or no change from 1989              
              to 1992?  The researcher anticipates finding instances of all                  
              three, so generally will focus on the conditions which foster                  
              increased and decreased computer literacy over time.  The                      
              researcher will do this by collecting data from 30 work groups                 
              which vary in the mean computer literacy score of the group.  The              
              researcher will select 15 groups that perform primarily clerical               
              functions and 15 groups which perform professional functions, from             
              the large set of work groups which have previously been studied.               
              Everyone in each of the selected work groups will fill out a short             
              questionnaire and a two-week log of their interactions with others             
              in the work group.  In addition, the researcher already has                    
              substantial data about each work group from the following:  two                
              interviews conducted with the head of each work group conducted                
              about 10 months apart, two questionnaires filled out by each person            
              who was working in the work group in summer 1988 and fall 1989.                
              Analyses will focus both on the individual and work group                      
              predictors of individual computer literacy and the predictors of               
              group computer literacy as well as factors which are associated                
              with higher computer literacy scores in 1992 than 1989 and those               
              associated with lower computer literacy in 1992 than 1989.                     
                                                                                             
              This research focuses on the workplace as an environment for                   
              increasing the computer literacy of American society.  The proposed            
              research will explore the factors associated with computer literacy            
              and computer expertise in ongoing work groups.                                 
                                                                                             
              The project furthers VPW program objectives to provide                         
              opportunities for women to advance their careers in science or                 
              engineering through research, and to encourage other women to                  
              pursue careers in these areas through the investigator's enhanced              
              visibility as a role model on the host campus.  The proposed                   
              activities which contribute to the second objective include:                   
              teaching a course, "Women and Men at Work;" giving lectures in                 
              other courses and/or public lectures; meeting with women's groups              
              (students, faculty, and staff); and mentoring students.
