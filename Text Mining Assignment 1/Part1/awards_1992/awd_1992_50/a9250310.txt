Abstract    :
              This project implements a new model of education intended to                   
              transform the way geographic techniques are taught to majors                   
              and non-majors in the Department of Geography at the University                
              of Texas.  Recent technological advances have intensified                      
              divergence between specialized training in geographical                        
              techniques and systematic training in geography's                              
              subdisciplines.  This project will enable the power of advances                
              in computer-assisted cartography, geographic information                       
              systems, remote sensing, and spatial statistics to be applied                  
              across the discipline.  Its method stresses the commonality of                 
              content and method in the practice of modern geography.
