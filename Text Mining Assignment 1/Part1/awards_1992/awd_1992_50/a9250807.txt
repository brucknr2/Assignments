Abstract    :
              A computer laboratory is being created for undergraduate                       
              ordinary differential equations.  The goals of the project are:                
              (1) to introduce the students to modern computational and                      
              symbolic methods for solving differential equations (2) to                     
              increase the understanding of qualitative and geometric                        
              behavior of differential equations, and (3) to develop the                     
              students' ability to derive and interpret mathematical models.                 
              Students will be encouraged to tackle open-ended problems as                   
              well as the more standard problems that have closed form                       
              solutions.
