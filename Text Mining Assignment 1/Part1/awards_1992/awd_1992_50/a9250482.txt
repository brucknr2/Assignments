Abstract    :
              A major redevelopment project is being undertaken in the                       
              calculus-differential equations sequence which is taught each                  
              quarter to about 900 students in the sciences, engineering, and                
              computer science.  The most basic concepts of these subjects                   
              are being developed graphically, and the visual impact of the                  
              graphical development is expected to lead to a stronger                        
              qualitative intuition for the subject.  Once the qualitative                   
              intuition that graphics provides is in place, the students have                
              a framework in which to imbed a more quantitative algebraic                    
              development of the same concepts.  This approach will enhance                  
              the student's ability in analyzing and then solving scientific                 
              problems.  For these purposes computers and symbolic                           
              manipulations software are providing graphical capabilities.                   
              Equally important to the project is the interactive notebook                   
              feature of Mathematica which is imperative to the exploratory                  
              approach incorporated into laboratory projects.  A                             
              philosophical belief of this project is that experimentation                   
              fosters intuition; and intuition builds mathematical skills and                
              the confidence to use them.
