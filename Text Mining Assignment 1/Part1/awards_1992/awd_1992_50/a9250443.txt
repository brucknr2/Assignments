Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics at the University of Evansville                  
              plans to improve its curriculum by implementing a computer-                    
              oriented approach in the calculus-differential equations                       
              sequence and in a calculus course for majors outside                           
              mathematics, engineering, and science.  The use of a computer                  
              algebra system in a computer laboratory classroom, for student                 
              exercises and projects, and as an instructional aid allows a                   
              shift of emphasis from manipulative  skills and techniques to                  
              activities with the computer that promote discovery,                           
              development of intuition, more realistic and meaningful                        
              applications, student interaction, improved expository skills,                 
              and experience with the computer as a modern mathematical tool.                
              As an early phase of the project, the Department of Mathematics                
              is initiating an intensive effort with the major departments                   
              served to arrive at consensus on what manipulative skills and                  
              techniques the students should be able to perform by hand and                  
              what tasks are more appropriate for the computer.  The results                 
              will serve as a model for mathematics departments with a heavy                 
              service load in the areas of engineering and/or the natural                    
              sciences.
