Abstract    :
              This project develops a soils mechanics laboratory for an                      
              undergraduate program in Construction Engineering Technology at                
              Norfolk State University.  A new laboratory facility is being                  
              provided for a soils mechanics laboratory to support an                        
              existing soil mechanics and foundation engineering lecture                     
              course.  In laboratory soils testing, students learn                           
              recommended testing procedures for making determinations of the                
              soil properties to be used in the design of construction                       
              projects.  Teaching this new laboratory allows the fourth                      
              largest HBCU institution the opportunity for a major                           
              improvement to its programs.  Also, the development allows                     
              students the opportunity to use equipment that currently is                    
              being used in industry.
