Abstract    :
              The project gives physics, astronomy, and physical science                     
              students the opportunity to perform classical experiments using                
              an array of sensory probes, computer analysis, and graphic                     
              displays.  This project uses the following equipment to provide                
              a microcomputer-based laboratory for physics and physical                      
              science students:  1) six Vectra 386/25, Model 80 computers                    
              with VGA monitors, and hard disc drives;  2) two Epson LQ1070                  
              printers;  3) additional hardware and software for HP Vectras;                 
              4) MPLO software and hardware from Vernier;  5) PSL-IBM starter                
              kit and software;  6) assorted sensors and probes from IBM;  7)                
              assorted sensors and probes from Vernier;  and 8) transducers                  
              and sensors from Pasco.
