Abstract    :
              This project uses CCD imaging and spectroscopy capabilities at                 
              the astronomical observatory of Central Michigan University.                   
              Students observe images with the CCD directly or use the                       
              spectrograph to observe emission lines in nebulae.  This will                  
              significantly improve instruction in the methods of                            
              observational astronomy for advanced astronomy students.  It                   
              will also increase opportunities for individual student                        
              research projects, especially senior projects by physics                       
              majors.
