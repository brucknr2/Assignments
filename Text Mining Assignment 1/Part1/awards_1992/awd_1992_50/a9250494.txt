Abstract    :
              The Chemistry Department has identified laboratory improvement                 
              guidelines including the needs:  to incorporate work using                     
              smaller and more complex samples, to emphasize real world                      
              chemistry, to use state-of-the-art instrumentation, to increase                
              laboratory efficiency so that more experimental work can be                    
              done, and to increase the understanding of chemical health and                 
              safety.  Acquisition of a 200 MHz FT-NMR Spectrometer with a                   
              variable temperature module will enhance all but the last of                   
              those principles in five of our upper division courses.                        
              Specific improvements include enhanced proton analysis, a new                  
              capability for 13C analysis, the computer controlled acquisition               
              and processing of data, application of FT-NMR analysis to small                
              samples, determination of kinetic and thermodynamic parameters,                
              and special pulse sequences for simplification of complex                      
              spectra.  In addition, the instrument will increase the range                  
              of projects available to undergraduates doing research.
