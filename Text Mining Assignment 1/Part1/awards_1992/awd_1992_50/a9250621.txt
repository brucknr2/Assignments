Abstract    :
              The acquisition of a Distributed Numerical Control (DNC) System                
              at Camden County College enables students to fully integrate                   
              Computer Aided Design (CAD) to Computer Aided Manufacturing                    
              (CAM) to the Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining.  This                 
              acquisition allows data to move automatically onto the factory                 
              floor, truly integrating computers in manufacturing.  The broad                
              goals of career education, education for life and employment,                  
              form the core of the Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM)                   
              curriculum.  The CIM curriculum provides students at the                       
              community college with the education and skills to respond to                  
              the present and future needs of business and industry, and the                 
              addition of the DNC system to the CIM laboratory creates a                     
              fully integrated industrial environment for the program.
