Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This one and one half year project intends to establish a                      
              California State University (CSU) - wide collaboration among                   
              the colleges of science and the colleges of education, each                    
              campus (20) and system-wide, to coordinate and assist the                      
              reform of science teaching development programs (preparation                   
              and enhancement) appropriate for science education k-12.                       
              TRIADS of a scientist, science educator, and science teacher                   
              (elementary and secondary science teaching leaders) on each                    
              campus will function as collegial teams for improving                          
              university science teaching development (STD) programs.                        
              Current restructuring efforts such as the Scope and Sequence                   
              and Coordination project will be incorporated into teacher                     
              preparation and enhancement programs throughout the CSU                        
              system.  In addition, a CSU-wide Collaboration Council for                     
              Science Teaching Development will be established.  The                         
              project's primary focus is to improve the science teaching                     
              development programs (pre and inservice) for educating                         
              professional teacher able to function as change agents for                     
              ongoing renewal of science education (K-12).
