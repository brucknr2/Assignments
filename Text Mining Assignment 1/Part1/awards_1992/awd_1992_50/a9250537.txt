Abstract    :
              Students preparation for careers as scientists and teachers                    
              will improve significantly by exposure in their laboratory                     
              classes and independent research to a histology and neural                     
              imaging system that enables one to peer into the workings and                  
              structure of the nervous system.  Existing psychology courses                  
              will improve, and we are adding an additional upper-level                      
              laboratory course on neural techniques and neuroanatomy.                       
              Concurrently, University of Richmond students will engage in                   
              activities with local middle-school science students, involving                
              them in laboratory experiences both at the university using the                
              new equipment and at their own school, promoting creative and                  
              critical thinking skills regarding the brain, nervous system                   
              and behavior, while fostering an interest in science.                          
              Collaborations will also continue with psychology faculty and                  
              students from neighboring Randolph-Macon Women's College.
