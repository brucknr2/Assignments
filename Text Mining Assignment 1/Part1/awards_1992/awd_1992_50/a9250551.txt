Abstract    :
              RIT is establishing an automated observatory on the campus for                 
              use in undergraduate instruction of non-science students,                      
              Physics majors, and Imaging Science majors.  The observatory is                
              equipped for visual, photometric, and CCD imaging use, and it                  
              can be operated manually or through real-time computer control                 
              from various lecture and laboratory rooms located about campus.                
              It will also be capable of robotic control to maximize its use                 
              for projects associated with the upper-division courses where                  
              there is a need for an additional student research facility.                   
              The specific choice of an automated (versus conventional)                      
              facility is a key to the "Herculean" task of bringing                          
              telescopic observations of a sufficient variety to large                       
              numbers of undergraduates.  The robotic capabilities are also                  
              in concert with a nationwide effort to enhance science                         
              education through astronomy.
