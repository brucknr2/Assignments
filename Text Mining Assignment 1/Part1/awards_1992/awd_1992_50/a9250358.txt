Abstract    :
              A computer-based, interactive instructional laboratory is being                
              developed to enhance the curriculum in College Algebra, to                     
              institute new instructional methods, and to develop                            
              instructional materials for enrichment.   To meet the                          
              instructional goals, the laboratory is equipped with twenty-                   
              four workstations linked in a token ring network managed by a                  
              network server that will maintain commercial software and                      
              exercises developed by the faculty.   The networked system                     
              provides a wide range of problem solving and graphing                          
              capabilities.   The laboratory provides the faculty with a new                 
              instructional vehicle and affords the student the opportunity                  
              to practice math skills in a non-traditional manner and explore                
              mathematics beyond normal limits in an efficient, non-                         
              threatening environment.  Instruction is further enhanced by                   
              opportunities for enrichment and a new emphasis on                             
              classroom/laboratory demonstrations incorporating active                       
              learning strategies.
