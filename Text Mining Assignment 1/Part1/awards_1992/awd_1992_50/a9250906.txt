Abstract    :
              The equipment requested includes a DNA synthesizer, a DNA                      
              sequencing apparatus and power supply, a shaking water bath and                
              x-ray film developing tanks.  Together with equipment already                  
              available in the department, this equipment will give the PI                   
              the  flexibility to tailor laboratory exercises to individual                  
              student interests.  The course will teach students to                          
              understand the processes in addition to the mechanics of                       
              research in molecular biology.
