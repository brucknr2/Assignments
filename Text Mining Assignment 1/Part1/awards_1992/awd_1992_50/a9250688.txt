Abstract    :
              The Morehead Radio Telescope (MRT) is being assembled to                       
              enhance the curricula in undergraduate physical science and                    
              science education programs.  It provides an instrument for                     
              undergraduate research projects in astronomy and astrophysics,                 
              and a laboratory in astronomy, physics, electrical engineering,                
              and computer science.  In addition, the MRT is used in science                 
              teacher education and in-service programs.  The telescope                      
              incorporates a modular design in which components may be easily                
              removed for use in laboratory investigations and for student                   
              research and design projects.  The sensitivity and versatility                 
              of the telescope design facilitate the investigation of a wide                 
              variety of astrophysical phenomena.
