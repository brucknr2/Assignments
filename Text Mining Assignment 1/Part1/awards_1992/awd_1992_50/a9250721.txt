Abstract    :
              The objective of the project is to create a Signal Processing                  
              Instructional Facility (SPIF) based on NeXT workstations and                   
              real-time digital signal processing development systems to                     
              augment, enhance, and interconnect required sophomore- and                     
              junior-level courses in linear systems.   The SPIF is also                     
              being used in an advanced senior-level elective course in                      
              digital signal processing.  The project uses Mathematica                       
              Notebooks for symbolic transforms and symbolic signal                          
              processing along with several public domain applications                       
              written for the NeXT platform.
