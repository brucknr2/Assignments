Abstract    :
              This project is establishing a modern optics laboratory course                 
              and completing the equipping of a recently constructed teaching                
              laboratory.  The aim of the project is to improve the advanced                 
              laboratory component of the physics curriculum by initiating a                 
              laboratory based course centered on modern optical devices and                 
              techniques, with signal detection and processing.  The project                 
              is significant in that it provides an important next step in an                
              intentional plan to improve the physics program and utilize the                
              interests, commitment, and expertise of new faculty leadership                 
              in the department.  The project also has the added benefit of                  
              encouraging students to pursue graduate study by exposing them                 
              to contemporary topics in physics.  Steady-state and time-                     
              resolved experiments are being performed with equipment                        
              provided for this project, which include as major pieces, an                   
              optical table, a photon-counter and associated detector, an                    
              air-cooled Argon ion laser, an acousto-optic modulator, and a                  
              data acquisition and analysis system.  Steady-state experiments                
              to be performed include single photon diffraction, optical                     
              fiber communication, heterodyne and Mach-Zender interferometry,                
              coherent backscattering, and microstatistical speckle                          
              correlation spectroscopy.  The time-resolved experiments                       
              include pulse propagation through disordered media,                            
              fluorescence measurements, and temporal pulse width                            
              measurements by autocorrelation.
