Abstract    :
              A microcomputer-based laboratory employing visual image                        
              processing technology is being developed for sociology courses                 
              that focus on mass media, mass media and communication, and                    
              cultural analysis. Students will use image processing computer                 
              applications to complete standardized laboratory projects, and                 
              to engage in independent study projects on topics in mass media                
              and cultural studies, e.g. gender roles and gender stereotypes                 
              in the mass media.
