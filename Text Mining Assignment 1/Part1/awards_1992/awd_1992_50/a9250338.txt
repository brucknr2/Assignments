Abstract    :
              This project will enhance the education of Centre's physics                    
              majors in the related areas of lasers, atomic spectroscopy and                 
              modern optics.  Students and faculty are fabricating a laser                   
              spectrometer and using it to study some details of the atomic                  
              structure of rubidium and possibly cesium.  Many of the system                 
              components (mirrors, detectors, diode lasers, a digital                        
              oscilloscope system) were purchased.  For pedagogical purposes,                
              however, undergraduates construct and test the laser controller                
              and detector circuits.  We are using the system in upper-                      
              divisional courses in modern physics, optics, and quantum                      
              mechanics.  Special student projects and research are conducted                
              in two areas: computer enhancement of laser spectra, and the                   
              effect of an external magnetic field on atomic spectra (Zeeman                 
              Effect).Our undergraduates gain experience in fabricating and                  
              using rather sophisticated optical, laser and electronic                       
              systems.  Students observe several important physical phenomena                
              in atomic spectra: line broadening due to thermal motion of                    
              gaseous atoms (Doppler effect), Zeeman splitting, isotopic                     
              effects (85Rb, 87Rb), and nuclear hyperfine effects (interaction               
              of electrons with nuclear spin, or magnetic dipole effect, and                 
              effects caused by the finite size of the nuclear charge, or                    
              nuclear quadrupole effect).  Finally, it is expected that this                 
              project will better prepare and motivate our physics students                  
              for graduate study.
