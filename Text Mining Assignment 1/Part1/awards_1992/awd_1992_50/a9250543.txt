Abstract    :
              The Departments of Chemistry and Geology are upgrading their                   
              respective curricula in the areas of x-ray diffractometry and                  
              spectrometry by adding a computerized control and data analysis                
              system to their x-ray diffractometer, and by replacing an                      
              obsolete ball mill used to prepare geological materials for                    
              quantitative analysis using an x-ray spectrometer. Students and                
              faculty have the capability of: collecting and storing x-ray                   
              diffraction patterns digitally as computer files where the data                
              can be easily accessed, processed, and analyzed; doing phase                   
              analysis of polycrystalline materials using an up-to-date                      
              version of the JCPDS powder diffraction file (on electronic                    
              media) and computerized search/match software; quantitatively                  
              determining the percentages of different phases in multiphase,                 
              crystalline materials; and  preparing geological materials for                 
              quantitative chemical analysis with a quiet, non-contaminating                 
              pulverizing system. Students are being provided with valuable                  
              experience in the use of computer-controlled instrumentation                   
              for data collection and analysis.
