Abstract    :
              The goal of the project is to provide field instrumentation for                
              use in a variety of undergraduate courses (primarily, Plant                    
              Community Analysis; secondarily, Forest Science, General                       
              Ecology, and Plant Physiology).  The equipment request includes                
              one laptop microcomputer and six complete dataloggers and a                    
              portable photosynthesis system.  The equipment is for use in a                 
              series of carefully tailored field and greenhouse experiments                  
              that provide students with:  1) exposure to modern                             
              instrumentation and field methods, 2) the notion that this                     
              equipment is interfaceable with microcomputers (for data                       
              downloading and analysis), 3) an opportunity to synthesize                     
              complex data from multiple sources and think more critically                   
              about community structure and organization, and 4) to stress                   
              the scientific method and design of experiments.
