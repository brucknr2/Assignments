Abstract    :
              An atomic absorption spectrometer is being used throughout the                 
              chemistry curriculum for the demonstration of fundamental                      
              aspects of atomic spectra as well as for elemental analyses.                   
              The spectrometer is being used in four existing courses:                       
              Instrumental Analysis, Analytical Chemistry, Biochemical                       
              Techniques, and Spectroscopy.  In addition, it is being used in                
              an Environmental Chemistry course which is under development as                
              part of a new Environmental Studies Program.  Finally, groups                  
              of high school students are bringing water samples to Shepherd                 
              College each year for analysis, and ongoing records of the                     
              results are being compiled by the high school students.
