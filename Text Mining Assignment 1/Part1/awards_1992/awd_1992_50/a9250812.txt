Abstract    :
              San Juan College is improving its laboratory for electrical                    
              engineering and technology students by incorporating equipment                 
              for computer supported data collection and wave analysis.  With                
              the new equipment for four workstations, students experience                   
              the control and storage of data through use of a personal                      
              computer.  These workstations are PC controlled, and each uses                 
              a high speed digitizer capable of storing simultaneous                         
              readings, using Assystant-GPIB software.  Students, over a                     
              quarter being Native Americans, learn better measurement                       
              methods, and are expected to take these skills into the                        
              workplace, helping local industry keep pace with current                       
              engineering practice.
