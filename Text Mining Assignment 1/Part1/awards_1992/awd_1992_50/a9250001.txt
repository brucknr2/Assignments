Abstract    :
              New data-analytic and concepts-based textbooks along with                      
              advances in statistical software, and computer and multimedia                  
              technology now offer the opportunity to rethink the way in                     
              which we teach statistics. This project, in coordination with                  
              an effort at Ohio State University, is combining and augmenting                
              these resources to develop a unified curriculum and supporting                 
              materials for teaching statistical concepts and methods.                       
              Products of the project will include: laboratory manuals                       
              designed as a bridge between standard texts and computer                       
              software that will guide students through experiments that                     
              generate data for analysis; start-up materials to aid students                 
              use computers for statistics; a machine-readable encyclopedia                  
              of examples and problems that will include data, descriptions                  
              of experiments, and computer-based retrieval; and a computer                   
              CD-ROM archive of edited video materials keyed to specific                     
              statistical concepts and tied to an instructional statistics                   
              program.
