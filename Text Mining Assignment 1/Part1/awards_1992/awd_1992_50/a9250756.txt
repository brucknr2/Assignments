Abstract    :
              This project will improve the education of women science majors                
              by providing them with hands-on experience with modern                         
              spectrometric instruments interfaced with computers to study                   
              molecular structure and dynamics.  The acquisition of a 90 MHz                 
              FT-NMR with multinuclear and variable temperature probes, a                    
              GC/MS, and a fast-scanning UV/VIS spectrophotometer, will                      
              provide for in-depth and challenging laboratory projects.  We                  
              will incorporate these projects into our curriculum by both                    
              expanding experiments that are currently used and replacing                    
              less sophisticated experiments that do not use advanced                        
              techniques.  Carrying out high-level experiments using                         
              sophisticated equipment will enhance the understanding of                      
              theoretical concepts and basic applications covered in the                     
              classroom.
