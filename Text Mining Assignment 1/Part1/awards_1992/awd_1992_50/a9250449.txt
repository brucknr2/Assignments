Abstract    :
              We are establishing a multi-purpose, undergraduate cognitive                   
              science laboratory facility, based upon a set of 386 computer                  
              workstations, to effectively teach existing laboratory courses                 
              in Sensation/Perception and in Basic Cognitive Science, and                    
              develop new laboratory courses in Applied Cognitive Sciences                   
              and in Psycholinguistics/Phonetics.  When not scheduled for                    
              classes, the facility is used for quality undergraduate,                       
              cognitive science, independent research projects.  The essence                 
              of the facility is a set of twelve separate student laboratory                 
              stations, each in a small, separate research room.  With this                  
              common flexible hardware, implementation of the different                      
              laboratory courses requires the knowledgeable application of                   
              specific software.  Each system is capable of producing wide                   
              ranges of auditory and visual stimuli, and recording a                         
              multitude of responses from human subjects.
