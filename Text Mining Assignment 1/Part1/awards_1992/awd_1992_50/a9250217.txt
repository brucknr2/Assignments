Abstract    :
              Electron spin resonance experiments with a JEOL RE-1X                          
              instrument will be incorporated in an innovative project-based                 
              laboratory program.  Students will investigate the structure                   
              and reactivity of unstable chemical species having odd numbers                 
              of electrons - free radicals and radical anions and cations -                  
              that are implicated in many chemical and biochemical reactions.                
              The project will upgrade the research-style ESR projects for                   
              students in their junior and senior years.  It will replace a                  
              30-year old vacuum tube instrument with a solid-state                          
              spectrometer that is 100 times more sensitive and much easier                  
              to operate.  The combination of enhanced spectrometer                          
              sensitivity and easy operation will permit all chemistry majors                
              to study free radical species of chemical and biochemical                      
              importance.
