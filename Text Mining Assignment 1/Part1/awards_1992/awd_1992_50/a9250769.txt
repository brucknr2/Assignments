Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is purchasing thermochemical                       
              equipment to update, broaden, and improve the thermochemical                   
              emphasis of its physical chemistry laboratory.  Students                       
              perform experiments involving the observation and measurement                  
              of critical temperature and pressure, fusion points and heats                  
              of fusion, phase diagrams, polymer phase transitions, and heats                
              of reactions.  These experiments are designed to improve                       
              student understanding of thermochemical processes by                           
              modernizing existing equipment and including student operated                  
              computer data collection and analysis.  This approach lays the                 
              foundation for further Physical Chemistry based research and                   
              coursework, and prepares students for the technical approach to                
              chemical observation and analysis prevalent in contemporary                    
              science.
