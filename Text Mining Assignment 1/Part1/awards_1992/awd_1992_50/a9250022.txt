Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Utah State Board of Education has approved the licensing                   
              of elementary mathematics specialists and each institution in                  
              the state of Utah has been given the opportunity to develop                    
              and submit a certification program for approval.  Weber State                  
              University seeks funds to develop this new program which will                  
              have as its foundation the guidelines set forth in the                         
              Curriculum and Evaluation Standards  of the National Council                   
              of Teachers of Mathematics and in the NCTM Professional                        
              Standards for the Teaching of Mathematics.  The program will                   
              be developed in the mathematics department in collaboration                    
              with the College of Education, and will include eight new                      
              courses:  geometry, intuitive calculus, probability and                        
              statistics, discrete mathematics, the use of technology,                       
              number theory, problem solving, and a senior project.                          
              Technology will be integrated throughout the program and                       
              modeled in the courses.                                                        
              An advisory group with members from all the teacher                            
              preparation programs in the state will work with Weber State                   
              University in the planning, implementation and dissemination.                  
              Nationally recognized mathematics educator will serve as                       
              consultants and advisors as well.                                              
                                                                                             
              The contribution of Weber State University accounts for 26% of                 
              the funds requested from NSF.
