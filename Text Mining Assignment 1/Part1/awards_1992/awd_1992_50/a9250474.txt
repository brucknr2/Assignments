Abstract    :
              The Department of Geological and Environmental Science is                      
              purchasing equipment to establish: 1) a hydrogeologic field                    
              laboratory, and 2) a groundwater modeling workstation.  The                    
              hydrogeologic field laboratory permits students to perform,                    
              under actual field conditions, groundwater-level measurements,                 
              pumping tests, and groundwater quality sampling.  Under                        
              agreement with a local power plant students will have access to                
              the monitoring wells field in the flyash disposal basin.  The                  
              groundwater modeling workstation allows students to design and                 
              test computer models of groundwater flow and contaminant                       
              transport.  Further, these two facilities are also being used                  
              in undergraduate research projects.
