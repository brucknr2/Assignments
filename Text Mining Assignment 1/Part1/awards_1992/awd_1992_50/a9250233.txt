Abstract    :
              The Department of Geology is purchasing computing equipment for                
              use in its General Geology course -- a course offered to non-                  
              science majors under the university's general education                        
              curriculum.  The required General Geology lab focuses on                       
              recording observations and using information from lecture to                   
              interpret those observations.  Conventional experiments are                    
              enhanced through the use of hypermedia applications that                       
              combine text, graphics, animation, and video.  Exercises                       
              integrate lecture and lab in a self-paced format that allows                   
              students to test their level of understanding, identify                        
              misconceptions, and seek background information as needed.                     
              These include applications ranging from the verification of                    
              appropriate tests in identifying unknown rocks and minerals, to                
              the visualization of geologic formations and the analysis of                   
              earthquake data.
