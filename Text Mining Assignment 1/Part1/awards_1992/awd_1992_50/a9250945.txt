Abstract    :
              Five workstations (Mac II-si, MacLab and electrophysiology                     
              instrumentation) are used by students in three interrelated                    
              courses: for Introductory Biology (2 semesters, 175                            
              students/semester), Comparative Physiology (offered alternate                  
              years, 15 students) and Neurobiology and Behavior (offered                     
              alternate years, 15 students) in student research.  Student                    
              computer use is phased in, beginning with analysis of simulated                
              data in lower division classes and leading to pooling and                      
              analysis of class data in more advanced classes.  The focus is                 
              on understanding muscle activity, nerve physiology and                         
              graphical data analysis.
