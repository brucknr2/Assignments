Abstract    :
              A Statistics Resource Center of 12 NeXT computer workstations                  
              is being developed to serve as a distributed electronic library                
              and laboratory for the teaching and learning of probability and                
              statistics.  This equipment supports a major project to develop                
              an interdisciplinary ensemble of computer-based lessons known                  
              as the "Statistics Source" to support the teaching and use of                  
              statistical analysis throughout the social sciences.  In                       
              addition to all the social sciences, faculty from biology,                     
              environmental science, and mathematics are participating in a                  
              multidisciplinary design team to create the Statistics Source                  
              and the Statistics Toolbox, a collection of both commercial and                
              locally developed, custom statistical tools for students to use                
              in their everyday work in social and natural sciences.  This                   
              project provides faculty throughout the social and natural                     
              sciences an instructional infrastructure sufficient for them to                
              integrate statistics and probability theory and their                          
              applications into a large number of courses.
