Abstract    :
              This project will make possible interactive, process-oriented                  
              laboratory instruction.  Experiments will emphasize                            
              observation, measurement, organization and analysis of data,                   
              and hypothesis formulation and testing.  Students will employ                  
              electrophoretic equipment to investigate topics in                             
              biotechnology, and spectrophotometry to study enzyme kinetics                  
              and microbial population growth.  Students will use computer-                  
              based, pre-laboratory simulations to prepare for actual lab                    
              work, and post-laboratory simulations to reinforce lecture and                 
              laboratory activities.  The new laboratory environment will                    
              foster scientific inquiry and will aid students in their                       
              development of critical thinking skills.
