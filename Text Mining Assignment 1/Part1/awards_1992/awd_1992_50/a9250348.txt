Abstract    :
              Materials are being adapted for the general calculus                           
              population, with which students use computing to solve                         
              realistic open-ended mathematical and scientific problems.  The                
              project will impact 700 students each fall, in contrast to the                 
              100 select students currently served.  The results of this                     
              project will serve as a model for large scale implementation in                
              other institutions.  Laboratories are equipped with                            
              workstations using Mathematica.  A text is being written and                   
              tested which significantly integrates technology into the                      
              course.
