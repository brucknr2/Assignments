Abstract    :
              Small cooled CCD cameras with wide-angle lenses and a portable                 
              control computer is used to increase student participation in                  
              outdoor, nighttime sky observations as an integral part of                     
              astronomy and physics laboratories.  Currently available                       
              technology makes it possible to assemble portable micro-                       
              observatories that even a novice can setup and operate.  The                   
              unguided images obtained in this way can be used for                           
              astrometry, photometry, and spectroscopy of bright stars,                      
              planets, and comets to red magnitudes of 6.5.  The micro-                      
              observatory concept can be used at any site where weather and                  
              lights normally render outdoor activities ineffective for                      
              producing useful scientific results in large class sections.
