Abstract    :
              This project is designed to enhance the learning process in the                
              undergraduate economics curriculum at Texas Christian                          
              University through the use of an Economics Computer Classroom.                 
              To accomplish this, the project must achieve two objectives:                   
              1) the establishment of two regularly offered introductory                     
              computer courses (one in microeconomics and one in                             
              macroeconomics) and an upper-division advanced computer course;                
              and 2) the incorporation of new analytical and statistical                     
              software packages into the department's upper-division courses                 
              and honors program that will provide hands-on computer                         
              experience for students.   The classroom will provide                          
              enrichment opportunities for students from other social science                
              departments as well as economics majors.  The computer classes                 
              and the enhancement of the upper-division curriculum will give                 
              students increased exposure to current computer technology and                 
              software.
