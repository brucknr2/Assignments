Abstract    :
              The project develops a teaching facility which utilizes                        
              commercially available computer and analytical instrumentation,                
              expands the number of students with hands-on access to micro-                  
              analytical systems, and allows for future expansion of                         
              techniques covered and students served.  The undergraduate                     
              science and engineering laboratory facility consists of a                      
              computer workstation/analysis system and twenty student                        
              terminals.  Analytical instruments are interfaced to the                       
              system, including a scanning electron microscope.  This                        
              facility allows hands-on access to both live-time and stored,                  
              archived data and increases the efficiency in learning                         
              techniques, contents, and methods of the many diverse fields                   
              requiring or benefitting from microanalysis.
