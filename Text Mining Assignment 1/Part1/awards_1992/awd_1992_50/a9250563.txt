Abstract    :
              This Department of Chemistry is purchasing a high field FT-NMR                 
              spectrometer with 13C and 1H resonance capabilities for use in                 
              the improvement of the undergraduate chemistry curriculum.  A                  
              particular effort is made to integrate the theory learned in                   
              formal courses with the undergraduate student research program.                
              The basic principles and practice of 13C and 1H FT-NMR                         
              spectrometry are first introduced in the sophomore Organic                     
              Chemistry Laboratory courses where students personally use the                 
              new instrument to determine organic structures.  The junior-                   
              senior laboratory courses (Physical Chemistry, Analytical                      
              Biochemistry, and Instrumental Analysis) center on the                         
              technical aspects of fourier transform methods and the                         
              applications of 13C NMR alongside 1H NMR spectroscopic                         
              techniques for quantitative measurements of chemical systems.                  
              Specific NMR experiments include the determination of                          
              equilibrium constants, thermodynamic properties, pka values,                   
              and substituent constants; and studies on enzyme kinetics,                     
              stereospecific reactions, hydrogen exchange rates, and reaction                
              mechanisms.  The use of the 13C/1H FT-NMR spectrometer also                    
              enhances the quality and quantity of student independent                       
              research which is an important component of the curriculum.
