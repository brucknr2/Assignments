Abstract    :
              This project will develop a High Resolution Imaging Systems                    
              Laboratory which will provide facilities for undergraduate                     
              electrical engineering students to undertake design projects in                
              sensor array processing, data fusion, machine vision, radar,                   
              video, and related fields.Senior electrical engineering                        
              students will work in teams on year-long design projects, where                
              they will be involved with all aspects of engineering design,                  
              including preparatory theoretical studies and literature                       
              searches; hardware, software, and system design; project                       
              management and scheduling; component selection and ordering; as                
              well as written and oral presentations and demonstrations, all                 
              under the guidance and oversight of an expert faculty                          
              advisor.Each project will involve the design and implementation                
              of a complete imaging system residing on a personal computer or                
              a high-powered workstation, or a standalone system that                        
              comprises specialized VLSI processors.  The equipment acquired                 
              consists of the circuitry, devices, and computer hardware and                  
              software to acquire and process image data.  It will permit the                
              implementation of the various types of imaging systems                         
              described above.  Both required and elective theoretical                       
              courses will be impacted by the proposed lab, allowing theory                  
              to be focused on the context of the design and application of                  
              real imaging systems.
