Abstract    :
              Recognizing the ever growing importance of computation and                     
              computer aids in engineering practice, Carnegie Mellon                         
              University's Department of Chemical Engineering is establishing                
              an advanced computational laboratory for undergraduate                         
              education.  The laboratory is used as an instructional aid in                  
              the teaching of all of the basic courses, such as fluid                        
              mechanics, reactor design, and chemistry, through the graphics                 
              capability of each student station and one large common                        
              viewscreen in the front of the laboratory.  Undergraduates are                 
              exposed to the computational laboratory from the freshman                      
              through the senior years so as to continually develop their                    
              computer skills and become comfortable with computers for a                    
              variety of tasks including word processing, numerical analysis,                
              spreadsheeting, and team (parallel) computation.  The                          
              uniqueness of this laboratory is the integration of computer                   
              methodologies into the learning process of students over their                 
              entire educational experience, so that each student will                       
              appreciate the range of computation from personal computers to                 
              workstation up to the supercomputer level, and know how and                    
              when to use each level.
