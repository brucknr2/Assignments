Abstract    :
              The Executive Committee of Project Kaleidoscope is conducting                  
              two workshops on undergraduate science and mathematics                         
              facilities, to be held at Lake Forest College in the summer and                
              fall of 1992. Project Kaleidoscope is an effort to strengthen                  
              science and mathematics at this nation's liberal arts colleges.                
              The goal of this workshop is to present models for developing                  
              effective science and mathematics facilities so as to: 1) advance              
              the planning process for undergraduate institutions involved in                
              such construction and renovation projects; 2) demonstrate how                  
              physical space fosters strong programs in science and                          
              mathematics; 3) help undergraduate institutions effectively                    
              manage the planning, design, and construction process in order                 
              to control costs and to realize the building they envisioned.                  
              The workshops have been designed in response to a need                         
              expressed by faculty and administrators at undergraduate                       
              institutions for sharing information about the planning and                    
              management of new and renovated space and for sharing successful               
              models.  The workshops are based on two premises of                            
              Project Kaleidoscope, namely that: 1) architecture and                         
              facilities must support good teaching and learning; and 2) we                  
              must work together to build on successful models, so that every                
              institution learns form others in their individual efforts to                  
              strengthen their science and mathematics programs.
