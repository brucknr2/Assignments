Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is purchasing two FTIR                             
              spectrophotometers for use in General Organic, and Analytical                  
              Chemistry laboratory courses and in a new Environmental                        
              Chemistry program undergoing development.  The General                         
              Chemistry course is being revised to emphasize real-world                      
              connections, to introduce synthetic and analytic aspects of                    
              chemistry and to instill a respect for environmental concerns.                 
              In the Organic and Analytical Chemistry courses, modern methods                
              of structural characterization are being introduceed that                      
              familiarize students with instrumentation commonly used in                     
              industrial and research laboratories.  These instruments are                   
              also being used by students engaged in undergraduate research.
