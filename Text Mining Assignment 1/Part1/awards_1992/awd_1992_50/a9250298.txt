Abstract    :
              A coordinated set of laboratory core exercises will take upper                 
              division cell and molecular biology majors from the cloning of                 
              a gene to the purification of its coded protein.  The exercises                
              is based on the baculovirus (Bac) expression system, a                         
              procedure that inserts foreign genes into a virus which infects                
              cell lines derived from moths and over produces the inserted                   
              gene.  The laboratory exercises will flow from the subcloning                  
              of genes into transfer vectors used with the Bac system to the                 
              chromatographic purification of the recombinant protein                        
              produced in the tissue cultured moth cells.  The DNA to RNA to                 
              protein principle of molecular biology is reinforced by the                    
              working relationship students receive with such important                      
              procedures as: tissue culture, manipulation of viruses of                      
              eukaryotic cells, in vitro manipulations of DNA molecules,                     
              specific detections of macromolecules (Western, Northern, and                  
              Southern blots), and protein purifications.  Senior Thesis                     
              projects will aslo employ the new laboratory equipment.
