Abstract    :
              One of the major goals of the undergraduate laboratory                         
              curriculum is to graduate physics majors who are familiar with                 
              modern instrumentation and are trained to interface this                       
              instrumentation with a computer.  Their physics majors are                     
              required to take a course in the computer control and computer                 
              acquisition and analysis of data.  Modern instrumentation is                   
              required in the advanced undergraduate laboratory so that they                 
              are able to build on the training students have received in                    
              this course.They are adding a variable temperature facility to                 
              the advanced undergraduate laboratories.  This equipment                       
              includes a cryocooler and associated temperature control and                   
              measurement instrumentation and additional instruments with                    
              computer interface to use with experiments performed on this                   
              cryocooler.  This facility allows them to introduce condensed                  
              matter physics experiments into the laboratory curriculum so                   
              that students are being trained in the area of study most of                   
              them will pursue after graduation.
