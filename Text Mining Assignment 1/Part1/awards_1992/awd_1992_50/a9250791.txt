Abstract    :
              Four experimental workstations are being built.  These stations                
              are being used in undergraduate electronic laboratories in                     
              order that students learn about and participate in computer                    
              control and interfacing.  Each station, when completed, will                   
              consist of a personal computer equipped with appropriate                       
              interface boards and a high-speed digital signal processor.                    
              With these workstations, students will learn how to gather and                 
              analyze experimental data.  Although this equipment is being                   
              used principally in our electronics lab course, it will greatly                
              enhance and benefit all of our advanced undergraduate                          
              laboratory courses.
