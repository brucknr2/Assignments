Abstract    :
              This project introduces a laboratory component to an existing                  
              Neurobiology course and adds computer capability to promote                    
              independent student projects in a current Animal Physiology                    
              course. The equipment added includes Macintosh IIsi computers,                 
              a data acquisition and analysis system (MacLab), and supporting                
              hardware and software.  The Neurobiology course focuses on the                 
              medicinal leech and covers such techniques as intracellular                    
              recording with microelectrodes, voltage clamp measurements of                  
              ionic currents, and computer-assisted data acquisition and                     
              analysis.  Equipment includes anti-vibration tabletops, Leitz                  
              and Huxley micromanipulator, A-M Systems intracellular                         
              amplifiers, an Axoclamp voltage clamp amplifier, and a Flaming-                
              Brown microelectrode puller.  In both laboratories students,                   
              working in teams of three, first learn a basic technique or                    
              principle and then formulate and test their own related                        
              hypothesis either by designing a mini-independent research                     
              project or redesigning the parameters for the basic laboratory.
