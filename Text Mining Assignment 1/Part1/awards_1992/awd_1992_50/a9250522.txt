Abstract    :
              Students apply a broad range of molecular, cytological and                     
              classical genetic techniques to problems at the gene,                          
              chromosome, organism, and population levels.  The organizing                   
              theme is  analysis of the Adh locus in Drosophila.  Experiments                
              include a molecular analysis of Adh variants, recombination and                
              cytological mapping of the Adh locus, analysis of polytene                     
              chromosomes exhibiting Adh-region rearrangements, histological                 
              analysis of the tissue, and an exploration of the genetic basis                
              of the response to selection for alcohol tolerance in a large                  
              population.  The equipment for this laboratory includes                        
              electrophoresis systems, centrifuges, and specialized                          
              microscopes.  The unique feature of this project is the use of                 
              a variety of techniques to study one system at a number of                     
              levels; from population statistics based on behavior to                        
              analysis of DNA sequences.  This multilevel approach conveys to                
              the students the true nature of research within the discipline.
