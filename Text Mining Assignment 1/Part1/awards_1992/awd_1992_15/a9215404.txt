              This award supports a number of trips to                                       
              Australia over a two year period by a team of                                  
              American researchers under the direction of                                    
              Dr. Thomas McIlrath of the University of                                       
              Maryland to conduct collaborative research with                                
              a similar team of Australian investigators at                                  
              the Laser Physics Center of the Australian                                     
              National University working with Dr. Kenneth                                   
              Baldwin.  The primary goal of this research is                                 
              in the application of high resolution molecular                                
              spectroscopy to short wavelength                                               
              photoabsorption by atomic and molecular systems                                
              of atmospheric, astrophysical and theoretical                                  
              importance. Extracting molecular                                               
              parameters from measured line shapes will                                      
              provide information needed to model temperature                                
              dependencies for atmospheric extinction                                        
              measurements; temperature dependent models are                                 
              very sensitive to the molecular line shape.                                    
                                                                                             
              This project will combine the expertise                                        
              represented by the U.S. participants with                                      
              similar expertise in Australia in the                                          
              development and application of the highest                                     
              monochromaticity short-wavelength research.                                    
              The research has relevance both in its                                         
              application to absorption processes in the                                     
              earth's atmosphere, and associated
