Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Under an International Travel Grant, the Principal                             
              Investigator and two graduate students will participate in the                 
              Second International Congress of Fluid Mechanics, to be held                   
              in June 1993 in China. They will also visit and attempt to                     
              initiate collaborative research programs in atomization in                     
              three Chinese institutions. Preliminary contacts with these                    
              institutions have already been established.                                    
                                                                                             
              Atomization processes for the production of uniform fine                       
              droplets is an important process in the production of ceramic                  
              materials.
