Abstract    :
                   This project is a continuation of a program of basic                      
              research in elementary particle physics.  The program consists of              
              experiments utilizing the major high energy accelerator                        
              facilities in the U.S., HERA in Germany, and at the Dugway                     
              Proving Grounds where the High Resolution Eye is installed.  The               
              experiments are in various stages of planning, construction, data              
              taking and analysis.  The Nevis research program is a vigorous                 
              and varied group of experiments addressing the fundamental                     
              questions in elementary particle physics.  The program also puts               
              a strong emphasis on detector and electronics development for                  
              experimentation.  The mix of forefront physics and                             
              instrumentation is attractive both for its scientific merits and               
              for the training of students and young physicists.  During the                 
              period of this proposal, Nevis faculty will be taking a leading                
              role in the GEM collaboration for the SSC, the ZEUS experiment at              
              HERA, the High Resolution Eye at Dugway, and the Neutrino and D0               
              programs at Fermilab.
