Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is for the PI to strengthen skills              
              related to proposal preparation for NSF.  A preliminary                        
              investigation of multi-layered pulsed photocathodes will be the                
              scientific thrust of the proposals written during the planning                 
              grant period.  Laser driven photoelectron sources can be pulsed                
              at very high rates and are capable of simultaneously achieving                 
              high brightness, long lifetime, and resistance to poor vacuum                  
              conditions.  Lanthanum Hexaboride is a low work function material              
              that can be used to make efficient photoemitters.  At present,                 
              most of the work on these photoemitters has been centered on the               
              large area, bulk, surface photoemission properties.  The details               
              of the photoemission process for multi-layered, transmission mode              
              Lanthanum Hexaboride photocathodes and photo-assisted                          
              microelectronic field emission cathodes will be investigated as a              
              long term goal.  The long term activities of proposed                          
              investigation involves fabricating and measuring the                           
              electrical and material properties of a variety of vertical and                
              lateral cathode structures.
