Abstract    :
              The research will develop a strategy for damping of payload motion             
              for various kinds of cranes used in construction, i.e. mobile                  
              cranes, boom or tower cranes etc. which can be easily implemented              
              on existing equipment.  There are several factors which influence              
              the dynamic behavior of the payload, such as velocity and                      
              acceleration, vibrations, slipping of wheels or support, and wind.             
              Most research in this area concentrates on controlling the velocity            
              and accelerations to eliminate inertial forces.  However, it is                
              almost impossible to realistically model the effects of wind,                  
              effects caused by slippage of tires, or settlement of support, etc.            
                                                                                             
              The research uses a new approach to control the swaying the                    
              payload, regardless of the cause.  The control strategy will be                
              based on applying periodic balancing forces and moments to the                 
              cable to damp out oscillations as when detected.  A feedback                   
              control systems applied t the cable has the potential of providing             
              an inexpensive and easily implemented solution.  This can be                   
              achieved by the decoupling the payload and cable system from the               
              structural members of the crane during the development of the                  
              control strategy.  Effective control of the payload will improve               
              safety, productivity and timeliness for a number of material                   
              handling operations.
