Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will permit the U.S. PI, Dr. Kenneth Golden of the                  
              Computer Science and Electrical Engineering Department,                        
              University of Vermont, to travel to Australia for a six-month                  
              stay to work with Dr. Jagadishwar Mahanty at the Australian                    
              National University's, Department of Theoretical Physics.  The                 
              work constitutes an extension of the U.S. PI's current research,               
              funded by NSF's Theoretical Physics Program (PHY 91-15695).  The               
              method to be used in conducting this theoretical work is the                   
              Quasi-Localized Charge approximation.                                          
                                                                                             
              It is expected that this joint effort will advance the state of                
              knowledge about the dynamical properties of strongly coupled                   
              Coulomb liquids, substantially improving our understanding of how              
              correlation effects modify the collective mode structures in                   
              superlattices.  The Theoretical Physics group at ANU has an                    
              outstanding reputation and Dr. Mahanty is renowned for his work                
              in solid state physics, specifically lattice dynamics and                      
              electron band theory.  The benefit to be derived is the joining                
              of the complementary skills of the investigators working in                    
              liquid-state plasma and solid state physics.  This research                    
              extends Dr. Golden's current NSF supported research on strongly                
              coupled Coulomb systems.
