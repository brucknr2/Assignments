Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program                 
              of the Chemistry Division, Brent Koplitz of Tulane University                  
              will investigate site-specific hydrogen-atom production in                     
              alkanes, haloalkanes, and organometallic compounds photolyzed                  
              under collisionless conditions.  The photochemistry of alkyl                   
              radicals produced by excimer laser photolysis will be followed                 
              using time-of-flight mass spectrometric detection of the                       
              Doppler profiles of the hydrogen (deuterium) atoms via their                   
              VUV transitions.  Ab initio calculations will also be performed                
              to gain additional insight into the photochemistry of the                      
              radicals.

              An understanding of site-specific haloalkane/radical                           
              photochemistry is of environmental importance in addition to                   
              its role in understanding fundamental photochemical processes                  
              in general.  The studies supported in this project should                      
              impact the understanding of HCFC (hydrochlorofluorocarbon)                     
              breakdown in the atmosphere as well as helping to clarify                      
              issues involved in the fabrication of semiconductors.
