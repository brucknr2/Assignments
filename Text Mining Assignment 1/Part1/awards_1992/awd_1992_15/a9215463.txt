Abstract    :
                   The development of solid modeling as an industrially viable               
              technology was paced by the development, in the 1970's, of theory              
              and algorithms for boolean operations on solids, i.e. for                      
              converting constructive (CSG) representations into boundary                    
              representations (B-reps).  Theory and algorithms for the inverse               
              conversion, from boundary to CSG (called BCSG), were largely                   
              unknown prior to the work of Shapiro and Vossler in 1989-91.  Their            
              cell-based methods are mathematically sound and have been                      
              implemented experimentally, but several important practical issues             
              remain open.  This research addresses those issues through the                 
              following goals:  (1) development of significantly better                      
              algorithms for cell-based BCSG conversion; (2) development of a                
              publicly available implementation of BCSG, initially for a domain              
              of natural quadric surfaces, that is usable with one or more open              
              architecture (i.e. public) B-rep modeling systems; and (3)                     
              development of theory and techniques, using new algebraic-patch and            
              constructive-shell representations, to enable BCSG conversion to               
              accommodate freeform solids.                                                   
                   This research will re-establish CSG as an industrially viable             
              representation for solids, and will enable fully symmetric dual-               
              representation modeling systems to be built which should be                    
              considerably more powerful than today's B-rep-only systems.
