Abstract    :
              This is an award to provide renewed support for the                            
              operation of the National Academy of Sciences, National                        
              Academy of Engineering, National Research Council's Water                      
              Science Technology Board.  This Board provides a focal                         
              point for studies related to environmental engineering                         
              aspects of water management.  The Board's objective is to                      
              improve the scientific and technological basis for                             
              resolving important questions and issues relating to water                     
              and wastewater aspects of environmental engineering                            
              practice.  An important function of the Board is to                            
              conduct studies and to sponsor workshops and conferences                       
              that can be utilized for program planning purposes.  The                       
              Board also functions as an appropriate means for                               
              coordination of research plans with other Federal agencies                     
              including FEMA, USGS, EPA, DOE, and the U.S. Army Corps of                     
              Engineers.
