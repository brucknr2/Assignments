Abstract    :
              The Marine Physical Laboratory at Scripps Institution of                       
              Oceanography will upgrade a suite of general purpose oceanographic             
              instruments that are used in long-term deployments on the sea                  
              floor.  These versatile electronic instruments are used to record              
              seafloor seismic and other signals for intervals of many months at             
              high data rates.  They were designed for low power consumption and             
              adaptability in order that a variety of oceanographic sensors could            
              be accommodated.  The upgrades will allow for six-month or longer              
              duration deployments with seismic, geodetic, electromagnetic, or               
              other sensors.  The recording medium will be increased to at least             
              1.2 Gbytes using one of more data recorders.  A data compression               
              scheme will be developed and ten instruments will receive new,                 
              precision timing devices.  Low power, temperature controlled quartz            
              oscillators will be installed in these instruments.  Once upgraded,            
              this suite of instruments will be capable of long-term deployments             
              required of experiments such as those proposed in the Global Change            
              RIDGE program and other individual research projects.
