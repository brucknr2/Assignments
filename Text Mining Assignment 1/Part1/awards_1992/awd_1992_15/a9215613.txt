Abstract    :
                   There is an ever-increasing interest in the ability to                    
              manufacture to dimensional accuracies in the nanometer range and               
              to attain surfaces with atomic level smoothness, free of residual              
              stresses and metallurgical defects.  One process used to achieve               
              sub-micrometer accuracies is single  point diamond turning (SPDT).             
              This project is to build two highly-specialized instruments which              
              will allow cutting with single-point diamond tools down to depths              
              of cut approaching atomic dimensions (less than 1 nm).  These                  
              instruments will be used in a series of experiments on ductile and             
              brittle materials to provide a more fundamental understanding of               
              nanometric cutting.  The work will enable investigation of the                 
              physics of material removal at the nanometer scale and, in                     
              addition, could provide the basis for tribological studies at this             
              scale.                                                                         
                   Ultraprecision machining technology will allow manufacturers              
              to produce more precise components for mechanical systems and to               
              produce higher quality substrates for semiconductor materials and              
              devices.
