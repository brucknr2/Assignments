Abstract    :
                Funds are requested for a Gordon Conference on fibronectin and               
              related macromolecules to meet in Oxnard, California, in February              
              1993.  The paradigm of an extracellular adhesin, fibronectin,                  
              interacting with a transmembrane receptor has proven applicable to             
              a number of adhesion systems.  In parallel has come the realization            
              that the transmembrane receptor for fibronectin is only one member             
              of the integrin family of functionally and structurally related                
              cell surface receptors.  These receptors and their ligands are                 
              involved in many basic functions of cells of all types, including              
              plants, e.g., adhesion, determination of shape, differentiation,               
              migration, cytoskeletal organization, and organization of                      
              extracellular matrix.  The challenge to the field over the next                
              several years is to comprehend and organize the large amount of new            
              structural information and design experiments based on it.  This               
              conference will serve as a valuable forum to present and discuss               
              new information, identify problem areas, and plan new approaches.
