Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This project will use a recently developed Non-Linear Fore-               
              Free (NLFF) model (Wu et tal. 1990) to study the magnetic                      
              configuration and structure of sunspots and active regions. The PI             
              will use magnetogram observations obtained with the MSFC vector                
              magnetograph (photosphere) together with correlated observations in            
              UV and X-rays (transition region and corona) from SMM. Supporting              
              observations in H and in radio wavelength also will be used. The              
              main objectives are: (i) to derive the three-dimensional magnetic              
              field configuration and physical structure in well-observed                    
              sunspots and active regions, based on multi-level observations                 
              using the NLFF model. (ii) to compare the calculated magnetic field            
              configurations, i.e. 3-D current system and loop structures with               
              those observed in UV and X-rays in order to identify local regions             
              of high current density and field gradient in various atmospheric              
              levels that are associated with flare energy build up and release              
              processes. By comparing the model calculations with observations,              
              the project will test the capability and accuracy of the newly                 
              developed NLFF model, and (iii) further develop regularization                 
              technique for NLFF calculations.
