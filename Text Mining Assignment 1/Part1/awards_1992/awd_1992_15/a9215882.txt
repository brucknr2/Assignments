Abstract    :
              An experimental and theoretical study is proposed for low                      
              temperature plasmas that contain particulates.  A plasma is an                 
              ionized gas, and in this work we will concentrate on weakly-                   
              ionized plasmas of the kind that are used widely in industry for               
              manufacturing semiconductors, optical materials, and magnetic                  
              media.  In a plasma, particulates (i.e. micron-size dust                       
              particles) become electrically charged.  They also may grow in                 
              size by collecting sputtered atoms in the plasma.  Particulates                
              are a costly problem industrial uses of plasma processing                      
              because they can fall to a substrate and contaminate it.   This                
              is the motivation for this work.  Experiments will be carried                  
              out to observe the time and density dependence of electrical                   
              charging of dust grains.  These measurements will employ                       
              optical detection of grains in parallel-plate radio-frequency                  
              plasmas, and the results will be used to test theories of                      
              particulate charging in plasmas. Theoretical modeling will be                  
              performed to simulate the trapping of ions by charged grains.                  
              Negatively charged grains can trap positive ions in confined                   
              orbits, and this cause a reduction in the net electric forces that             
              the charged grains experience.  This modeling will employ                      
              numerical simulations of the motion of ions, including                         
              collisions with neutral atoms as well as the electric force                    
              created by charged grains.
