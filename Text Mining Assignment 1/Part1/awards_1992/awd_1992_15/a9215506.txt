Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to permit Dr. A. Gani Ilahude, Chief,                
              Oceanography Division, Research and Development Centre for                     
              Oceanology, Jakarta, Indonesia, to visit the United States to                  
              plan, for a period of one month, with Dr. Arnold L. Gordon,                    
              Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory, Columbia University,                    
              collaborative research on Indonesian Ocean Circulation and                     
              Mixing.  The two collaborators also will finalize research                     
              reports on a 1991 research cruise and report their results at an               
              American Geophysical Union Meeting in San Francisco, in December               
              1992.                                                                          
                                                                                             
              The study of the throughflow of Pacific Ocean water into the                   
              Indian Ocean via straits in the Indonesian Archipelago is a                    
              matter of great scientific interest in gaining an understanding                
              global ocean circulation.   The two collaborators are highly                   
              respected scientists who have outstanding records of research in               
              the field of this project.  The present project and the research               
              which they will plan will allow them to combine their talents for              
              mutual benefit.  This project is relevant to the objectives of                 
              the Science in Developing Countries Program which seeks to                     
              increase the level of cooperation between U.S. scientists and                  
              engineers and their counterparts in developing countries through               
              the exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and                     
              techniques and through collaboration on problems of mutual                     
              benefit.  Support of Dr. Gordon's participation  in this project               
              is provided through an award from the NSF Division of Ocean                    
              Sciences.
