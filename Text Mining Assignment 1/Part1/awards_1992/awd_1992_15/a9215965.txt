Abstract    :
                   This award supports a conference entitled: "Convergence in                
              Erogdic Theory and Probability".  The conference will be held                  
              from 23 to 26 June 1993, at Ohio State University.                             
                   The conference will be concerned with the behavior of                     
              averages along subsequences and weighted averages in general,                  
              which have been studied using techniques from harmonic analysis,               
              number theory, and measure theory..  The objectives of the                     
              conference are:                                                                
                   1.  Improve communication among researchers of these                      
                   interrelated fields;                                                      
                   2.  Stimulate additional connections the lines of                         
                   investigation involved in these studies.
