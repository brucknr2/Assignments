Abstract    :
              The work will conduct experiments to examine piiiezoelectric                   
              hysteresis, piezoelectric material nonlinearities under combined               
              loading.  This will represent an advance over the linear                       
              representations currently available.  The effects of                           
              manaufacturing processes on actuator performance will be also                  
              explored.  The research will include both analysis and                         
              experiments to predict performance of piezoceramic monolothic and              
              array configurations.  The development will increase the                       
              reliability and sensitivity of smart material and structure                    
              development efforts.
