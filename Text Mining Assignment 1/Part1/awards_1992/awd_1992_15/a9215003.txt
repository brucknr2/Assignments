Abstract    :
                   This award supports research in field theory and commutative              
              algebra.  The principal investigator will study the relationship               
              between the multiplicative structure of field extensions which                 
              are Galois and certain associated groups and invariants.  He will              
              also work on a scheme for computing Picard groups of affine rings              
              over fields that are not necessarily algebraically closed. The                 
              computations are heavily influenced by the multiplicative                      
              structure of the finite extensions of the base field.                          
                   A ring is an algebraic object having both an addition and a               
              multiplication defined on it.  Every element a in the ring has an              
              additive inverse usually denoted -a.  However, elements are not                
              required to have multiplicative inverses.  A ring in which every               
              nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse is called a field.                
              This project concerns the relationship between the multiplicative              
              structure of a field and that of its subfields.  It involves a                 
              combination of techniques from field theory, group theory and                  
              number theory.
