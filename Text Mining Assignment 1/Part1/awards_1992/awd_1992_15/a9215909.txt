Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support the participation of seven U.S.                        
              scientists in a joint seminar on the topic of the influence of                 
              tropical rivers on costal oceanographic processes in the region                
              of southern New Guinea and the Coral Sea.  The seminar will be                 
              held at the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) located              
              near Townsville, Queensland, Australia in June 1993.  Coastal                  
              environments adjacent to tropical rivers include many unique                   
              characteristics.  Tropical and subtropical rivers discharge                    
              nearly 3/4 of the runoff and sediment reaching the coastal ocean.              
              The geological record preserved by accumulating sediments                      
              provides important information.                                                
                                                                                             
              Australian researchers are investigating a multi-disciplinary                  
              range of processes along the southeastern coast of New Guinea and              
              in the Coral Sea near the mouth of the Fly River.  U.S.                        
              scientists are investigating similar processes on the continental              
              margin near the mouth of the Amazon River.  This seminar will                  
              bring together Australian and U.S. oceanographers to discuss                   
              their current research.  The meeting is being co-organized by Dr.              
              Charles Nittrover of SUNY-Stonybrook and Dr. Gregg Brunskill of                
              AIMS.                                                                          
                                                                                             
              The formal sessions will be devoted to delineating the                         
              similarities and differences between the two coastal systems. A                
              further objective will be to evaluate observations and                         
              conclusions with regard to their generality for tropical                       
              settings.  Placing these two river systems in perspective will                 
              provide an understanding of other low latitude river systems.                  
              Participation of researchers from Papua New Guinea is also                     
              expected.
