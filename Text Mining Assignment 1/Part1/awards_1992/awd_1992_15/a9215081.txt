Abstract    :
              This proposal is for partial support of a Gordon Research                      
              Conference on Active Phenomena in Solar System Plasmas to be held              
              July 13-17, 1992 in Plymouth, NH.  The requested funds, including              
              also $12,000 from the Gordon Research Conferences and $6000 from               
              NASA, will be utilized to support subsistence and/or travel for                
              invited speakers, discussion leaders, and students and others who              
              require financial assistance in order to attend the Conference.                
              The biennial Gordon Conference in Space Plasma Physics has                     
              provided an ideal informal setting since 1977 to address "hot"                 
              topics.  This year's theme, active phenomena, is a crucial topic               
              because most solar system plasmas are not in equilibrium and thus              
              contain free energy which can be released rapidly.  In certain                 
              regions, explosive energy can occur; examples include solar                    
              flares, coronal mass ejections, cometary tail disruptions, and                 
              magnetospheric substorms.
