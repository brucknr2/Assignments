Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              Why do adolescents engage in different types of activities?  Why               
              do some work hard on their school subjects while others get                    
              involved in other activities, including problem behaviors?  Do                 
              these activity choices related to the educational, vocational,                 
              and family options they pursue in their early twenties?  This is               
              a longitudinal follow-up to an existing large scale data set.                  
              These investigators have developed a theoretical framework to                  
              investigate such questions and have used this model to study                   
              during the ontogeny of education and role-related choices during               
              adolescence in a sample of 2380 youths.  This project follows                  
              this sample as they make the transition into adulthood and will                
              assess the utility of the framework for predicting adult role                  
              choices and look at the long term sequelae of adolescent behavior              
              patterns and social experiences.  Two type of data will be                     
              collected.  A telephone interview will be conducted, and data                  
              will be merged with questionnaire data collected with other                    
              support.  These data will then be used to test basic theoretical               
              predictions.
