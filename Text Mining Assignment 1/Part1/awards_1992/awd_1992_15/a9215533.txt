Abstract    :
                   This SGER award supports an exploratory, high-risk, high-                 
              payoff project aimed at determining the feasibility of using modern            
              GPS receivers aboard a variety of spacecraft, along with radio                 
              occultation science previously used to explore the atmospheres of              
              the planets, to measure high-resolution temperature and water vapor            
              profiles in the Earth's atmosphere.  The research has important                
              potential application to global change research.
