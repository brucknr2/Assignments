Abstract    :
              Redinbo         Mobile cellular communication systems, a rapidly growing 
              communications medium, rely upon significant digital processing  elements,
              particularly in the central cell sites where numerous  users in a geographic
              area interface with the full network.   Reliability is a serious design
              requirement where processing  elements are shared among many users and failures
              can  significantly degrade the network performance for all users.   This
              research is applying new evolving fault tolerance design  methodologies to
              modern system designs which employ  configurations of high-speed functional
              processing units,  Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs).         In
              the new fault-tolerance design philosophy, algorithm-  based fault tolerance,
              data sample integrity is paramount, and  special number codes are being used to
              generate parity values in  parallel with the normal processing operations. 
              Comparisons  between these values and other associated parity generation are 
              very similar to functional elements employed in the main  processing
              operations, and therefore can be substituted for  failed functional elements
              when failures are detected.         The important interrelationships between
              detecting failed  functional units and protecting the underlying control units
              are  being examined.  Simple reliability calculations employing 
              straightforward failure rate models are being used to guide fault  tolerance
              levels and the system location for detection  facilities.
