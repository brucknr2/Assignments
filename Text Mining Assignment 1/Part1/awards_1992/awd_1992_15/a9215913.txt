Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The goal of this research is to characterize chemical species             
              on the surface of small (< 10 nm) metal particles, suspended in                
              liquid media, using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SER).  The            
              research is focussed on colloidal systems consisting of nonaqueous             
              suspensions media and/or chemically reactive metals.  The physical             
              mechanism by which species on metals (such as lithium, sodium,                 
              potassium, rubidium and aluminum) produce enhanced Raman scattering            
              will be explored.  The results of these studies are important in               
              developing a better understanding of surface adhesion, lubrication             
              and protection of metal surfaces for corrosion resistance.
