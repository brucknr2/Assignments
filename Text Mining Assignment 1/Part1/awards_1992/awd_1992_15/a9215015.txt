Abstract    :
                   Professor Stern will investigate the use of Lamb-shift                    
              quench radiation to map the rich spectrum of fields                            
              (fluctuations, instabilities, elementary excitations) supported                
              by and excited in a plasma.  The phenomena investigated will have              
              an important impact on solar and astrophysics as well as the                   
              fundamental physics of plasmas.
