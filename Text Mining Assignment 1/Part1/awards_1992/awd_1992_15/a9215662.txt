Abstract    :
                   The objective of this research is to significantly advance                
              the-state-of-the-art in operation of semiconductor manufacturing.              
              Specifically, it will address real-time control of wafer production            
              (i.e., the fabrication of integrated circuits onto silicon wafers).            
              If successful, this research will lead to substantial improvements             
              in factory operations, and ultimately, increased competitiveness               
              of United States microelectronics manufacturers.                               
                   This research addresses development of an advanced real-time              
              system control framework that will direct the efficient operation              
              of large wafer fabrication facilities.  Specifically, the research             
              will develop control policies within a new framework (Generalized              
              Semi- Markov Decision Processes) that controls to target sets                  
              rather than to moments.  With this research, the investigator will             
              seek to develop the fundamental science base required to                       
              significantly advance real-time product flow control of wafer                  
              fabrication processes.
