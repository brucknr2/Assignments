Abstract    :
                      As the application of computers to the physical   widens, there is an
              increasing need for computers to deal  with the physical attributes of objects,
              such as their   geometry.  The relatively young field of Computational Geometry
              has made  impressive strides in providing an  algorithmic foundation for the
              solution to many geometric  problems in computer graphics, computer vision,
              robotics, and  many other application areas.  This project undertakes   in the
              design and analysis of geometric algorithms in a   of areas including Voronoi
              diagrams and Delaunay   triangulations,  the computation of arrangements or
              parts thereof, and   and intersection problems.  The robustness issue in
              geometric  computing is also addressed.  The goal is to extend  the current
              methods of computational geometry to deal more  effectively with problems in
              spaces of higher dimension   (three or  more) and involving objects of higher
              algebraic  complexity(curved, as opposed to straight).
