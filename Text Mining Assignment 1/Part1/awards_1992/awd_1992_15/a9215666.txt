Abstract    :
                   This project is to provide funding for sixteen faculty members            
              from minority and women's institutions to attend the 1992 Snowbird             
              Conference of the Computing Research Association, and for four                 
              individuals identified by the Computing Research Association to                
              participate in the 1992 Conference of the Association of Department            
              Heads of Computer Science and Engineering at Minority Institutions.            
              This is an extremely worthwhile endeavor which should establish                
              lasting links between the major research institutions in computer              
              science and the group of institutions that service a significant               
              number of students from underrepresented populations in computer               
              science and engineering.  It is critical that more individuals from            
              underrepresented populations become involved in research activities            
              in computer science and engineering, and this project represents a             
              strong effort in that direction.
