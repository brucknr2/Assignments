Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This research project is directed at improved understanding               
              and prediction of atmospheric variability with time scales longer              
              than a week.  This 'low-frequency variability' is generated by                 
              external forcing (as in the annual cycle), dynamical processes                 
              internal to the atmosphere such as blocking, and by interactions               
              between the atmosphere and the underlying media (primarily the                 
              oceanic mixed layer and the land-surface hydrology).  The research             
              involves the diagnosis of observational data sets using statistical            
              techniques such as compositing, digital filtering, principal                   
              component analysis, singular value decomposition, and cluster                  
              analysis.  Results are interpreted in light of the current                     
              theoretical understanding of weather and climate systems.  The                 
              research will address (1) detection and interpretation of                      
              interannual and interdecadal climate variability in Northern                   
              Hemisphere temperature and pressure fields, (2) nonlinear aspects              
              of low-frequency variability including the question of whether the             
              Northern Hemisphere winter circulation exhibits distinct                       
              'circulation regimes' manifested in truly bimodal frequency                    
              distributions, (3) relationships between patterns of sea-surface               
              temperature anomalies observed in different seasons and in                     
              different parts of the world ocean, (4) some poorly understood                 
              aspects of the climatological mean annual cycle and (5) systematic             
              errors in extended-range numerical weather prediction.  This                   
              research is important because it seeks to improve our understanding            
              of weather and climate processes and hence has the potential for               
              improving our ability to predict weather and climate.
