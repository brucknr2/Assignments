Abstract    :
              The research is a combined experimental-analytical-computational               
              effort to study high temperature deformation mechanisms in                     
              nickel-base superalloy single crystals.  Special attention will                
              be paid to two-phase nature of the material, the effects of non-               
              Schmid shear stresses and latent hardening on viscoplastic                     
              deformation behavior.  Three dimensional constitutive relations                
              will be developed that will facilitate the analysis and design of              
              structural components made from single crystals.//
