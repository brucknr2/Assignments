Abstract    :
              Fundamental issues of the methodology, convex modelling of                     
              uncertainty, dedicated to unified treatment of geometric and                   
              material characteristics, are put forward in this research.                    
              Instead of classical probabilistic methods, no probabilistic                   
              treatment is utilized, but the new set-theoretical description of              
              the uncertain variables and functions is presented.  In addition,              
              instead of usual optimization problems, where the minimum possible             
              responses or least favorable shapes of the structures are sought,              
              here an uncertainty modelling is developed as an anti-optimization             
              problem of finding the least favorable responses due to shape or               
              material uncertainty.  Special emphases are placed on vibration and            
              dynamic buckling of viscoelastic structures.  The novel dynamic                
              stability criterion based on Lyapunov exponents is introduced for              
              viscoelastic structures.  New treatment of uncertainty is                      
              especially attractive from the design point of view-since extrenal             
              responses can be used for valid design of structures, with scant               
              experimental data needed for their substantiation.
