Abstract    :
              This collaborative effort will make use of an extensive and unique             
              data set collected over several years from the Chukchi Sea.                    
              Investigators from three institutions will study the interactions              
              of physical, chemical, and biological processes of the Chukchi Sea             
              ecosystem to define its present and perhaps future trophic status              
              in a series of data and simulation analyses.  The biological                   
              processes associated with chemical and physical processes in the               
              Chukchi Sea will be assessed using data from a series of 13 current            
              meter moorings in 1990-1991 and seven bilateral U.S.-U.S.S.R.                  
              cruises during 1988-1991.  The source water concentrations of                  
              nutrients flowing through Bering Strait into the Arctic will be                
              determined on an annual basis for the years 1988-1991 and will be              
              combined with buoyancy flux estimates to calculate nutrient flux               
              estimates.  Work will be undertaken to analyze various scenarios of            
              ice cover, primary production, DOC releases, and CO2 exchange with             
              the atmosphere, using a biochemical model of high vertical reso-               
              lution (1 m) coupled to a barotropic circulation model of coarse               
              horizontal resolution (10km).  In addition, dominant phytoplankton             
              groups will be identified and related to their respective nutrient             
              habitats.  The work supports the goals and research priorities of              
              the Arctic System Science (ARCSS) program of the Global Geosciences            
              Initiative.
