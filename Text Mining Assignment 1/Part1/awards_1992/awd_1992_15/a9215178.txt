Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Committee on Human Factors is constituted as part of the                   
              National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences.  The            
              mission is to develop new perspectives on theoretical and                      
              methodological issues and to provide guidance on research needed to            
              expand the scientific basis and application of human factors to the            
              programs of government agencies and other interested organizations.            
              This funding is the NSF contribution toward this effort which is               
              also funded by several other agencies.  Under the present funding              
              the Committee on Human Factors will develop several reports                    
              including one on the topic of national needs in the area of virtual            
              environment science and technology.
