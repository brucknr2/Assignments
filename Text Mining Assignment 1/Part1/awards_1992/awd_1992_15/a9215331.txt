Abstract    :
                  9215331  Childers      This is the second year of a three year continuing
              award to  investigate three major topics in the area of speech synthesis.   The
              first deals with improving the resolution of existing models of  several voice
              types such as modal register, vocal fry, falsetto,  and breathy, and extending
              them to additional types such as hoarse  and harsh.  These models will be used
              to investigate the relation  between voice production features and aspects of
              the acoustic  signal through the use of interactive, high quality, formant
              speech  synthesis.  The second aspect of the research deals with refining  the
              articulatory speech synthesizer to allow the models of voice  types to be
              related to speech production physiology, e.g.,  articulator position and
              movement, and vocal fold vibration motion.    The third aspect is to develop
              quantitative measures of speech  quality and vocal function.  Anticipated areas
              of exploration  include the quantification of glottal flow waveform and its 
              spectral characteristics corresponding to variations in vocal  quality. 
              Additionally, the vocal fold mass and length, the  aperiodicity of the vocal
              fold motion, and the glottal area will be  related to aspects of vocal quality.
               A unique characteristic of  the models developed is their interactivity, that
              allows the user  to adjust features of the models related to physiological 
              characteristics of the speech production process.  This allows the  user of the
              model to test new hypotheses related to voice  production by adjusting
              parameters in the model.  Two possible  areas of application are the
              development to training aids for the  hearing impaired and the design of speech
              codes based on  articulatory movements.
