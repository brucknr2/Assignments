Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective of this work is to prepare and publish an                        
              identification atlas of the galaxy M33, which is one of the two                
              closest galaxies to our own.  This atlas will make astronomical                
              research on various objects within the galaxy more efficient, and              
              will be particularly useful in the coming era of very large                    
              telescopes.  Charts as well as tabular and positional material                 
              will be included.                                                              
                                                                                             
              The Principal Investigator is a highly regarded expert in this                 
              field.
