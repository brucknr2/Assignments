Abstract    :
              9215145  Hesselink  Both experimental and numerical techniques are becoming more
              sophisticated leading towards very large multivariate, time-dependent datasets
              describing complex physical phenomena.  Visualization approaches for analysis
              and display of these datasets are currently inadequate, in particular when
              dealing with tensor data.  The project addresses the need for better
              understanding of these datasets by investigating an integrated approach based
              on the triad of enabling technologies of feature extraction, data compression,
              and immersive environments.      Three-dimensional datasets of increased
              complexity: tensor data and time-dependent fields will be displayed and
              analyzed.  Most of the research effort is aimed at understanding the dynamical
              properties of physical systems that give rise to these large multivariate
              datasets.  Therefore, techniques used for visualizing steady fields must be
              extended in order to visualize time-dependent data.  Time-dependent data may be
              handled by animation of the individual time steps.  Processing time for
              animations, however, are notoriously long.  Therefore, data compression is
              being investigated at several stages of the integrated visualization process. 
              In the analysis component, data compression of tensor fields is based on
              extracting and displaying hyperparticle paths using tensor field topology.  In
              the display component, time-dependent fields may be analyzed and displayed
              using advanced data compression techniques such as vector clustering and 4-D
              transforms.  Finally, the results of these analysis are displayed with tools
              from immersive environments, data compression  techniques applied to rendering
              approaches, and other new technologies.  ***   v       s  t             @ j <
