Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project brings together two groups of astronomers who are                 
              actively working on the abundance patterns in the stellar                      
              populations of the Milky Way Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds.                 
              The U.S. team, headed by Donald Terndrup of The Ohio State                     
              University in cooperation with Ruth Peterson of the Lick                       
              Observatory, will collaborate with Michael Bessell of the                      
              Australian National Observatory and the Mount Stromlo Observatory              
              and Elaine Sadler of the Anglo-Australian Observatory (AAO). This              
              award provides funds for the U.S. investigators to attend                      
              observing runs in Australia. Using other sources of                            
              support, Terndrup and Peterson will conduct further observations               
              of bulge K giants at the Cerro Tololo Observatory in Chile while               
              Bessell and Sadler will do the same for globular cluster stars                 
              using Australian facilities.                                                   
                                                                                             
              Specifically, the program will conduct observations of bulge and               
              cluster stars to determine the abundance of oxygen and other                   
              alpha-capture elements. The relative abundances will generate                  
              information on the rate and manner of chemical enrichment in the               
              bulge of the Galaxy and in metal-rich globular clusters.                       
              Increased understanding of the temperatures and compositions of K              
              giants will be used to generate diagnostic indicators of                       
              temperature, metallicity and gravity for lower-resolution optical              
              and infrared studies of metal-rich stars.                                      
                                                                                             
              The project, supported jointly by NSF and the Australian                       
              Department of Industry, Technology, and Commerce (DITAC)                       
              provides access to international expertise and unique                          
              observational facilities.
