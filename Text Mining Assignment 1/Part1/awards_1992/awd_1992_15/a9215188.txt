Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The object of this research is the simulation, by numerical               
              means, of the initiation and growth of hail using two and three                
              dimensional cloud models incorporating various microphysical                   
              structures and processes.                                                      
                                                                                             
                   The study will focus on proving or disproving a series of                 
              hypotheses developed for the Hailswath II field program.  The                  
              hypotheses involve the origin of ice and hailstone embryos in the              
              storms, the growth of hailstones, and the development of feeder                
              cells and the main updrafts of the storm system.                               
                                                                                             
                   Several well-observed case studies will be used to test                   
              various hypotheses.  Cases from the Cooperative Convective                     
              Precipitation Experiment (CCOPE), the North Dakota Thunderstorm                
              Project (NDTP), and the Alberta hail study have been published and             
              provide outstanding insights into the development of hail and the              
              dynamics of the hailstorm.  Some of these cases have been simulated            
              in our two-dimensional bulk water and 20-category hail models.                 
              Further simulations using these models and the Clark three-                    
              dimensional cloud model will be used to compare with the                       
              observations.  An important development of the model will be the               
              addition of hailstone growth equations to the basic microphysics of            
              the 3D cloud model.
