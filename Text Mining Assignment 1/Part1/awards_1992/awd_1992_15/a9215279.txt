Abstract    :
                   This project will provide theoretical studies of the                      
              interactions of energetic particles with the solar wind. The                   
              studies will be broad-based and include interstellar and cometary              
              pickup ions, galactic cosmic rays, shock-accelerated particles                 
              including the cosmic ray anomalous component, and solar slare                  
              particles. A unifying theme is the influence of genergetic                     
              particles on the structure and location of the solar wind                      
              termination shock. The investigations will emphasize analytical                
              methods, the microprocesses governing the interactions including               
              wave excitation by the energetic particles, and comparisons between            
              the theoretical results and spacecraft oberservations. The goal of             
              the study is a better understanding of the structure of the                    
              heliosphere and its enegetic particles.                                        
                   Specific topics of research are, for example:                             
                   1) A prediction of the momentum- and mass-loading of the solar            
              wind by interstellar H+ and He+.                                               
                   2) A prediction of the shift in the location of the                       
              termination shock due to interstellar pickup ions and cosmic rays.             
                   3) Development of an analytical model for the solar-cycle                 
              variation of cosmic rays at high energies.                                     
                   4) Acceleration of lower-energy "seed" particles at shocks.
