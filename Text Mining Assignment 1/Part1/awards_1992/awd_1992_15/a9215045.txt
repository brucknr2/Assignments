Abstract    :
              This is an award to support continued research on the feasibility              
              of using discarded vehicle tires for producing marketable forms                
              of carbon.  The proposal leading to this recommendation results                
              from successful completion of a Phase I, Small Business                        
              Innovation Research project conducted under NSF Grant No. 92-                  
              15045 in which the feasibility of a pyrolysis process to convert               
              used tires into potentially marketable carbon products was                     
              demonstrated.  In Phase II, the investigator plans on extending                
              work initiated during the previous phase to address questions of               
              optimal tire particle size, gas composition for the activation                 
              step and the potential uses for process by-products.                           
                                                                                             
              A significant problem in management of solid wastes is addressed               
              by the project.  Accumulations of tires on occasion become                     
              ignited causing significant environmental problems.  Methods to                
              reprocess tires for recovery and reuse of their components may be              
              a more environmentally correct way of dealing with them than                   
              either controlled or uncontrolled combustion.  This Phase II                   
              award was made in accord with procedures contained in Program
