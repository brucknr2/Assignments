Abstract    :
                   The project requests funds for                                            
              participation of 50 faculty members from                                       
              minority institutions to attend the 1992                                       
              National Education Computing Conference                                        
              (NECC'92) in Dallas, June 15-17, 1992.  This                                   
              is an extremely worthwhile endeavor which                                      
              expands on support we have provided for                                        
              faculty from minority institutions to attend                                   
              the Computer Science Conference.  The NECC                                     
              provides a broader view of computers in                                        
              education focusing on the use of computers                                     
              across all disciplines.  It is critical that                                   
              faculty at minority institutions attend                                        
              national conferences of this type in order to                                  
              become better integrated into the research and                                 
              education communities.  This project                                           
              represents a strong effort in that direction.
