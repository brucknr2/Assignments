Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project supports the dissertation research of an                          
              anthropology student from the University of Michigan in                        
              Nicaragua.  The student's project is to understand how                         
              government-sponsored local cultural centers attempted to impose a              
              national set of values in the Sandinista era, and how this failed              
              or succeeded in different local situations.  Using a combination               
              of ethnographic methods including participant observation and                  
              community surveys, the student will try to assess reasons for the              
              varying success and failure of these centers.                                  
                                                                                             
              This research is particularly timely at the present time, when                 
              the break-up of the Yugoslavian state shows that local resistance              
              to national ideologies is powerful and long-lived.  This sort of               
              in-depth case study can provide valuable information to explain                
              the success or failure of programs of national integration.
