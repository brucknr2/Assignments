Abstract    :
              The main objectives of this study include: 1. To expand on a                   
              previous study and determine required unit energy levels imparted              
              to a soil to induce liquefaction through laboratory testing of                 
              granular soils in the torsional shear device; 2. To determine the              
              energy levels required for liquefaction under random loading, and              
              compare them to the ones needed under sinusoidal loading; 3. To                
              develop and validate a rational procedure to determine the                     
              liquefaction potential of soil deposits based on relationships                 
              between soil characteristics and energy levels, along with time                
              series of design earthquakes. The validation procedure will                    
              include the analysis of time series and pore water pressure                    
              development records obtained during earthquakes.
