Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this doctoral dissertation improvement                
              award is to clarify the physical and cultural capabilities of an               
              ancestor of humans, Homo erectus.  H. erectus is particularly                  
              important as it was this species which first moved out of Africa               
              and colonized much of the Old World, implying improvement in the               
              ability to deal with environmental challenges. This earlier hominid            
              is represented at Olduvai Gorge in East Africa, a site which                   
              contains rich faunal assemblages from the appropriate period of                
              about 1.7 to 1.2 million years ago.                                            
                                                                                             
              The investigators will undertake a two fold approach to clarifying             
              the abilities of these hominids.  First, the fauna from Bed II at              
              Olduvai Gorge will be analyzed in order to determine the processes             
              which led to their deposition. The types and frequencies of bones,             
              their sizes, abrasion and modification can assist in determining               
              the subsistence behavior of H. erectus.  Secondly a series of                  
              ethnoarchaeological experiments will be carried out to clarify the             
              behavioral interpretation of hominid bone processing.  Butchery                
              marks on bone resulting from observed practices among the Samburu              
              of Kenya will be compared to the evidence left by our ancestors in             
              orde r to better understand the ways in which the earlier forms                
              processed their food.
