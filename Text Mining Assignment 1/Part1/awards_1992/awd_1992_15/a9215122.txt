Abstract    :
                   This project will examine the following two topics:                        
                                                                                             
                       1)   The understanding of solar-terrestrial relationships            
              and the solar-interplanetary electrodynamical phenomena which                  
              control the propagation of energetic charged particles in                      
              the heliosphere over a 22-year solar magnetic cycle, and,                      
                                                                                             
                   2)   The physics of solar flare charged particle acceleration             
              propagation and the associated neutron emission from solar flares.             
                                                                                             
                   The experimental approach to the first topic is based on using            
              charged particles as probes of the heliospheric magnetic fields.               
              For the second topic, the PI will investigate solar flare particles            
              acceleration through spacecraft measurements of the charge                     
              particles spectra, elemental and isotopic composition as a function            
              of time for nuclear species from hydrogen to nickel. Studies also              
              are made of solar flare neutron emission using a high altitude,                
              equatorial super monitor. Both scientific objectives require the               
              continuing support of neutron monitors (for nuclei of relativistic             
              energies) and a network of instruments on spacecraft located                   
              throughout the heliosphere. This proposal includes support for the             
              standard neutron monitors at Climax, Colorado, and Mt. Haleakala as            
              well as the 18-counter super monitor on Mt. Haleakala. The data                
              from this network are available to the scientific community. The               
              remainder of the proposal supports analytical and theoretical                  
              research directed to the research areas described above.
