Abstract    :
                   Modeling of the perturbations of atmospheric emissions                    
              due to gravity waves and tides at mesopause altitudes (85km)                   
              provides insight into the coupling between chemistry and                       
              dynamics in this region. Without theoretical models to serve                   
              as a guide, ambiguities will exist in the interpretation of                    
              nightglow observations of gravity waves and tides. The Na-D                    
              nightglow has never been modeled in terms of gravity wave                      
              forcing. The modeling of the effects of gravity waves on the                   
              Na layer, as revealed, in lidar measurements have until now                    
              only included dynamics and not considered chemistry.                           
                   We propose to model gravity wave-driven fluctuations in                   
              the sodium nightglow by developing a model that incorporates                   
              both dynamics and chemistry. This new model will use the                       
              most recent self-consistent model of the sodium chemistry,                     
              including reactions involving neutral species, ions and                        
              cluster-ions. The dynamics will be based on linear gravity                     
              wave theory but will include the generalized effects of eddy                   
              diffusivities. Na and OH nightglow measured with an all-sky                    
              camera system will provide us with the horizontal wavelength                   
              and period, and azimuth of propagation and the relative                        
              intensity variations of the two nightglows for comparison                      
              with the Na nightglow fluctuation models and OH nightglow.
