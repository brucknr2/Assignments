Abstract    :
              This project addresses the primary                                             
              obstacle to realizing the                                                      
              significant potential of                                                       
              thermophilic bacteria for ethanol                                              
              production:  low product selectivity                                           
              (yield of ethanol/yield of products                                            
              other than ethanol).  Three tasks                                              
              are to be carried out. Task 1                                                  
              involves cloning Clostridium                                                   
              thermocellum target genes (acetate                                             
              kinase and/or phosphotransacetylase,                                           
              lactate dehydrogenase) in                                                      
              Escherichia coli, deleting a portion                                           
              of the target genes to render the                                              
              corresponding enzymes                                                          
              non-functional, and preparing                                                  
              plasmid constructs for                                                         
              reintroduction of the deleted genes                                            
              back into C. thermocellum.  Task 2                                             
              involves development of an                                                     
              electroporation protocol to                                                    
              introduce deleted genes into C.                                                
              thermocellum on a non-replicative                                              
              plasmid.  Task 3 utilizes continuous                                           
              culture to simultaneously verify                                               
              strain stability, evaluate ethanol                                             
              tolerance, and examine the metabolic                                           
              and/or kinetic impact(s) of pathway                                            
              manipulation.  This project is novel                                           
              in the context of the emerging field                                           
              of pathway (or metabolic)                                                      
              engineering because it: (1) uses a                                             
              host organism for which knowledge of                                           
              genetics is not well developed; (2)                                            
              uses gene deletion to manipulate                                               
              flux in a branched pathway rather                                              
              than overexpression; and (3) does                                              
              not require a replicative plasmid or                                           
              expression of plasmid-borne genes.
