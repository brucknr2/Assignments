Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support the travel of eight U.S. participants to               
              a joint U.S.-Australia seminar on gender, science and technology.              
              The seminar co-organizers are Dr. Joan H. Fujimura from the                    
              Department of Sociology at Harvard University and Dr. Ann Dugdale              
              from the University of Melbourne where she is a Lecturer in the                
              History and Philosophy of Science. The seminar will take place                 
              in Melbourne between June 26 and July 1, 1993 under the auspices               
              of the U.S.-Australia Cooperative Science Program.                             
                                                                                             
              The seminar will focus on the historical and social analysis of                
              interactions among gender, science and technology. Considerable                
              attention will be directed toward elucidating specific case                    
              studies in which methodologies have been developed for                         
              analyzing the influence of gender on scientific and technological              
              knowledge and practice. Through the study of science and                       
              technology in their social, cultural, epistemological and                      
              historical contexts, highlighting the role of gender as one                    
              variable  shaping scientific and technical expertise, the                      
              participants should contribute analyses that will stimulate                    
              policies directed at achieving access and equity goals in                      
              scientific and technical fields. This seminar is being co-funded               
              by the Australian Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce              
              (DITAC).
