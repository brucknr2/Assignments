Abstract    :
              The emphasis of this research project is on accurately modeling                
              the friction characteristics so that its effect can be predicted               
              in simulations. Friction has a significant influence on control                
              systems since it limits their accuracy and speed, and may even                 
              induce tendency to instability, In addition to extending the                   
              reset integrator model, a new method of adaptive friction                      
              compensation is introduced. With this approach it is possible to               
              estimate the coefficient of friction while the system is in                    
              operation, and to use this estimate to cancel out the friction                 
              component by an opposite term in control. The technique is                     
              verified by simulation, and the utility of adaptive compensation               
              is validated experimentally via an apparatus designed and                      
              fabricated during the research period.***  //
