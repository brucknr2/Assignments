Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program                 
              of the Chemistry Division, Breckenridge of the University of                   
              Utah will study the spectroscopy and excited-state dynamics of                 
              metal/reactant systems using the "half-collision" approach of                  
              dissociating van der Waals molecules.  Metals to be examined                   
              include Na, Al, and Cr, while the reactants are molecular                      
              hydrogen, H2, and methane, CH4.  The metal atoms are created by                
              laser ablation and are "gently" attached to the reactants by                   
              expanding through a supersonic jet to form the one-to-one van                  
              der Waals complexes.  The complexes can be excited to initial                  
              states selected for orbital alignment and initial geometry.                    
              Detection is by laser-induced fluorescence and resonant multi-                 
              photon ionization.                                                             
              %%%                                                                            
              In this project Prof. Breckenridge forms a loosely bound                       
              cluster of a metal atom and a molecular partner with which the                 
              metal can react.  He energizes the cluster using laser light                   
              and follows the products from the resulting breakup of the                     
              cluster.  By varying the wavelength of the exciting light,                     
              specific reaction paths of the excited metal atoms and reagents                
              can be specified, which in turn allows Breckenridge to                         
              determine the effect of different types of excitation on the                   
              course of a chemical reaction.
