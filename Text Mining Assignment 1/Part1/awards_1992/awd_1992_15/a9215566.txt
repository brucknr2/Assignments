Abstract    :
              In this project, the Method of Moments is used to solve the                    
              acoustic field problems with mixed boundary conditions. At                     
              present, these problems are solved using a combination of finite               
              element method (FEM), and the boundary element method, since no                
              single method can handle both types of boundary conditions                     
              (finite and infinite domains). The Method of Moments has been                  
              widely used so far for solving both differential and integral                  
              formulations of electromagnetic field problems. The simple and                 
              flexible nature of the method make it ideally suited for solution              
              of complex acoustic field problems typically encountered in                    
              aerospace and automotive systems.***   //
