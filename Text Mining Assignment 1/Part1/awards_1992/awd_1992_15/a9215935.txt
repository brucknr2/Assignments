Abstract    :
              To exploit the fact that many construction projects are planned and            
              work methods selectedbased on previous experience, a scheduling                
              model using case-based reasoning is presented.  This model not                 
              only adapts previous cases to suit a new project to be                         
              scheduled; it also extracts and summarizes planning knowledge                  
              from several cases and stores that as part of its knowledge base               
              for future use.  Thus the storage problem that arises when keeping             
              many cases around is reduced, as planning knowledge is                         
              incrementally compiled.                                                        
                                                                                             
              To efficiently retrieve this compiled knowledge or the cases,                  
              CasePlan uses a product model that describes at a general                      
              level what design elements are present in projects and how they                
              structurally or functionally relate to another.  The product model             
              is used for case classification and learning planning knowledge.               
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
              The research demonstrates the importance of product models in                  
              organizing and compiling knowledge.  The CasePlan system                       
              resulting from this research will also be a state-of-the-art                   
              automated scheduler for construction.  Its schedules will                      
              have enough detail to drive a discrete-event simulation of                     
              construction execution of the project, which can provide                       
              execution feedback and serve to assess the quality of CasePlan's               
              output.
