Abstract    :
              The principle objective of this work is to characterize                        
              analytically the stress and deformation fields accompanying crack              
              growth in ductile single crystals and deformation fields at                    
              interfaces joining a ductile material to a brittle one.  The                   
              analytical results will be checked with full-field numerical                   
              finite element solutions, and also with experiments that                       
              correspond to the analyses.  The aim is to devise local                        
              descriptions, incorporating single crystal plasticity, as a                    
              function of general remote loadings.
