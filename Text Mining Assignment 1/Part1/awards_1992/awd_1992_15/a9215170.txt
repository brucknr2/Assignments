Abstract    :
              9215170  Pearson  Techniques will be developed that facilitate the least squares
               parameter identification for systems modeled by a class of  nonlinear
              input-output differential and functional differential  equations.  Examples for
              this class will be found in diverse  areas such as pharmacokinetics, robotics,
              lasers, and  viscoelastic materials, as well as modeling for control systems 
              engineering.  Techniques will also be developed for the  nonparametric
              multivariable linear system (frequency transfer  function matrix)
              identification problem, as well as the  parametric and (possibly) the
              nonparametric identification of  time-varying linear differential system
              models.  Unique to these  formulations will be a discrete-frequency format
              brought about by  the introduction of a set of complex-valued Fourier based 
              modulating functions for the classical Shinbrot method of moment  functional. 
              A basic motivation for using Shinbrot's method is  that it circumvents dealing
              with unknown initial and boundary  conditions for time-limited input-output
              data, i.e., no state  estimation is involved.  In addition to the
              discrete-frequency  format, a basic motivation for developing the Fourier
              modulating  functions is that the underlying computations will use the  DFT/FFT
              algorithm, thus providing a "fast algorithm" for setting  up the least squares
              problem.  Structure determination procedures  may be developed for particular
              classes of system, like those  modeled by polynomial input-output differential
              equations.  ***
