Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This support will allow initiation of the data verification phase of           
              the project to computerize of the Museum of Zoology bird collection.           
              The collection (190,000 specimens) was captured into a database                
              (MUSE for birds) under a previous award.  Data verification will               
              involve comparing the database records directly to the specimens and           
              detection/correction of errors.

              This award will support the second and final phase of the project to           
              database the bird collection of 190,000 specimens at the University            
              of Michigan, one of the most important in the nation to research               
              education on the biology of birds.  The computerized database will             
              be checked against the actual specimens and specimen tags to correct           
              errors.  The completed database will be a powerful research and                
              educational tool at the University and on electronic networks, such            
              as Internet.
