Abstract    :
              This Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) project is in                
              the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the                
              subfield of electrosynthesis of materials.  During the tenure of               
              this three-year continuing grant, Professor Norton and his                     
              undergraduate research students will investigate chemical and                  
              structural limitations of superconducting bismuthate materials.                
              An electrochemical growth method will be employed to produce                   
              superconducting crystals with various compositions and the                     
              structures of these crystals will be mapped using scanning                     
              tunneling microscopy (STM), x-ray diffraction, and related                     
              structural probes.  Additionally, these materials will be                      
              characterized chemically and magnetically.  Optimum crystals will              
              be selected and utilized in a number of physical studies directed              
              toward a basic understanding of oxide superconductor behavior.

              This project will contribute to an enhanced understanding of the               
              fundamental structure-property relationships of these                          
              technologically important materials.  Additionally, the research               
              experience gained by participating undergraduate students will                 
              contribute substantively to the development of the infrastructure              
              of this interdisciplinary area of the chemical sciences.
