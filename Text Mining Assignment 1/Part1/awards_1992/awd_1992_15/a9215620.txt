Abstract    :
              9215620  Hsu       This project addresses vision effecting adaptiveness in 
              integrated manufacturing enterprises for the next decade.  This  vision has
              been developed on the basis of the intensive research  over the past nine
              years.  The research will investigate new  fundamental information technology
              to enable Adaptive Integrated  Manufacturing Enterprises (AIME).  It is focused
              on four major  problems: (1) management of multiple systems that operate 
              concurrently over a widely distributed network without a central  controller,
              (2) achievement of open systems architecture that can  accommodate legacy
              systems as well as add new systems, (3)  implementation of object-oriented
              technology in production systems  with the crucial ability of managing
              heterogeneous views and  changes, and (4) inspection-linked enterprise
              information  requirements-modeling and utilization to close up the feedback 
              logic from production to design.       The research will develop an AIME
              information architecture  with attendant techniques, an extended
              object-oriented technology  for an AIME software environment, and AIME
              information requirements  modeling through in-process verification and
              inspection.  A  multidisciplinary research team of investigators will conduct
              the  research.
