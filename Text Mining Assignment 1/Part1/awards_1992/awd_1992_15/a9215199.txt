Abstract    :
                   This project is on the design of efficient algorithms for                 
              combinatorial problems on graphs.  A major focus is on                         
              crossing families.  Such families are exemplified by the                       
              minimum cuts of a graph; problems involving minimum cuts                       
              include issues of edge connectivity, graph augmentation and                    
              orientation, feedback sets on planar graphs and others.  The                   
              first part of the project is to develop a compact                              
              representation for crossing families.  Many problems on                        
              crossing families can be solved using the framework of                         
              submodular network flow.  Currently algorithms for submodular                  
              flow run in high-degree polynomial time.  An important goal of                 
              the project is to make such algorithms more efficient.  One of                 
              the main tools to achieve the goal will be the new                             
              representation - it allows the efficient computation of                        
              information commonly needed for submodular-flow type                           
              algorithms.  Crossing families also arise in the study of                      
              graph rigidity and scene analysis.  The project will develop                   
              efficient algorithms for applications in these areas and                       
              others.  Related issues in the study of graph connectivity;                    
              and optimization on matroids will also be investigated.  The                   
              goals of this project help increase knowledge about succinct                   
              representation of information and efficient computation on                     
              discrete structures.
