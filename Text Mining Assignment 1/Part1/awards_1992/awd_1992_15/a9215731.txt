Abstract    :
              Ambiguity in context-free grammars can be expressed in terms                   
              of algebraic equations and detected via an algebraic approach.                 
              This project involves the implementation of algorithms to                      
              detect ambiguity, identify certain ambiguity causing                           
              constructs, and transform these constructs into less ambiguous                 
              constructs.
