Abstract    :
              The research will study the overall electromechanical behavior of              
              laminated structures, and interaction of electric fields with                  
              material inhomogeneities.  The stress behavior at the interface                
              between dielectric-dielectric and dielectric-electroconducting                 
              layers which may be induced by external mechanical loads or by                 
              application of high voltages.  Elastic and electric fields near                
              cracks, voids and inclusions will be established using complex                 
              variable approach.  The ultimate aim is to predict the                         
              performance of piezoceramic multilayer structures.
