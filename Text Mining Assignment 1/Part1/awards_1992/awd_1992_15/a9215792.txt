Abstract    :
                   This work attempts to actively engage the academic community              
              in Engineering Metrology, an area vital to manufacturing.                      
              Engineering Metrology forms the backbone of interchangeable                    
              manufacturing.  This characteristic combined with an increasing                
              need to manufacture to tighter tolerances, in the recent past,                 
              dictates that a scientific approach to the issues that impact this             
              area is needed.  Projects that will be addressed include                       
              development of methodologies for ultra-high accuracy two                       
              dimensional stage metrology for lithography applications, basic                
              work in engineering metrology for threads, and development of                  
              calibration procedures, methods and standards for atomic scale                 
              measurement instruments.                                                       
                   This work is critical to a variety of industries in the                   
              manufacturing sector.  The problems to be addressed in this                    
              research includes the mechanical and micro-electronic industries.              
              The results of this work will provide leading edge technology to               
              these industries and enhance their competitiveness.
