Abstract    :
                   This research effort is designed to develop an Electro                    
              Discharge Machining (EDM) technology data base for hard to machine,            
              brittle materials and develop an on-line monitoring and control                
              scheme for process optimization based on standard statistical and              
              neural network approaches.  This will enable the efficient                     
              machining of complex contours in materials such as polycrystalline             
              diamond (PCD) and conductive ceramics.  Since the EDM process is               
              complex and random due to transient dielectric flow conditions and             
              distribution of debris, deterministic and stochastic modelling and             
              analysis will be utilized to understand the process and to develop             
              quantitative models for the material removal rates, arcing and wire            
              rupture.                                                                       
                   This research is very timely in the sense that utilization of             
              hard materials for a variety of industrial processes is on an                  
              increase.  The ability to monitor and optimize the EDM process will            
              have a significant impact on the efficiency and productivity of                
              industry.
