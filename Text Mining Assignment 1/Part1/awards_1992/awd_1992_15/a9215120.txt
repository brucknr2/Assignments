Abstract    :
              This award provides partial support for a joint U.S.-China                     
              workshop on photoinduced charge transfer.  The topic of the                    
              workshop is an important one, both from the point of view of                   
              basic science and technology, underpinning both the imaging                    
              and the photographic industries.  China has made rapid                         
              scientific progress in the topic of the workshop, and it is                    
              hoped that this meeting will expand longer term research                       
              collaboration in this field.                                                   
                                                                                             
              The organizer on the US side is Dr. David Whitten, Director                    
              of the NSF Center for Photoinduced Charge Transfer at the                      
              University of Rochester; on the Chinese side the organizer is                  
              Professor Yi Cao, Director of the CAS Institute of                             
              Photographic Chemistry.
