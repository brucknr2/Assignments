Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Americas Program award will support a                                     
              laboratory-workshop course to familiarize young                                
              scientists with modern approaches for exploring                                
              structural events at the cell and molecular                                    
              level. Using advanced imaging technologies on                                  
              marine and mammalian gametes and embryos,                                      
              dynamic events in the cell cycle and during                                    
              development will be observed.  The application                                 
              of imaging equipment in the broad field of cell                                
              and developmental biology and the biological                                   
              insights derived from such technology will                                     
              continue to lead to important discoveries.                                     
                                                                                             
              This workshop, organized by Dr. Gerald Schatten                                
              of the University of Wisconsin, Madison and Dr.                                
              Claudio Barros, of the Catholic University,                                    
              Chile, will take place in the Marine Laboratory                                
              of the Catholic University of the North,                                       
              Coquimbo, Chile.  The participants, young                                      
              scientists on a postdoctoral level, will come                                  
              from countries in South and Central America and                                
              from other countries. The program should result                                
              in a very successful exchange of                                               
              scientific/technological information which                                     
              could lead to long term interactions between                                   
              the participants.  The areas of development and                                
              reproduction are of general concern to                                         
              scientists around the globe and sharing                                        
              knowledge and technique in this area is                                        
              essential.  The global scientific community                                    
              will most certainly benefit from this                                          
              interaction.
