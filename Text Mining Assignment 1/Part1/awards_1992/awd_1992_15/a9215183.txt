Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Corals are notoriously sensitive to elevated temperatures and this             
              sensitivity has come to frame debates regarding the responsiveness             
              of reef systems to global climate change.  This project will                   
              explore aspects of the dynamics of the coral vascular system, an               
              inter-connecting system of polyps and stolons or oscillators.  Buss            
              hypothesizes that coral bleaching, and ultimately mortality,                   
              results from the chaotic change in the size of the vascular system.            
              To explore this possibility, Buss plans to alter the velocity of               
              gastrovascular flow through stolons experimentally and to monitor              
              radial diameter of stolons using sophisticated video and image                 
              analysis.  Then, to visualize the chaotic behavior of the vascular             
              system, a spatial grid of coupled oscillators will be developed.               
              The model should predict the behavior dynamics of corals based on              
              perturbation studies of living material and lead to a better                   
              understanding why corals adopt specific structural forms.
