Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program            
              will assist the Department of Chemistry at the University of                   
              Tennessee in the purchase of a Laser Raman spectrometer.  Several              
              faculty members whose research is dependent upon laser Raman                   
              spectroscopy will greatly benefit from the acquisition of this                 
              instrument. Research projects to be carried out with this                      
              instrument include: (1) the chemistry of molten chloroaluminate                
              salts, (2) study of molten salt electrochemical cells, (3) the                 
              chemical vapor deposition of diamond, (4) the characterization of              
              fullerenes and their derivatives, (5) the determination of chemical            
              composition for process control with energy reduction, and (6)                 
              laser fluorescence of species in the diffusion layer of modified               
              electrodes.                                                                    
              %%%                                                                            
                   A laser Raman spectrometer provides important spectroscopic               
              data which can be used to obtain information about molecular                   
              structure, molecular symmetry and molecular dynamics.
