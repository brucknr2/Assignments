Abstract    :
                   This research effort is to establish a scientific                         
              understanding and basis for the drilling operation.  While most                
              metal removal operations have enjoyed substantial increases in                 
              speed and efficiency over the last few decades, drilling has been              
              and exception.  Yet, it continues to be a major operation in most              
              manufacturing enterprises and as result constitutes a major                    
              impediment to increases in manufacturing productivity.  An attempt             
              improving efficiency, could result in the much needed breakthrough.            
              In this effort a Computer Integrated Design, Manufacturing and                 
              Evaluation (CIDME) platform will be developed, which will consist              
              of four modules.  These will be:  (1) a drill point modelling                  
              module, (2) a drill grinding module, (3) a drill performance                   
              evaluation module, and (4) a computer integration module.  This                
              will enable this effort to synthesize all available techniques,                
              bridge the missing links between the different modules and to                  
              develop a scientific framework for drill point design, grinding and            
              performance evaluation.                                                        
                   This significance of this research effort is clearly                      
              illustrated by the degree of industrial financial support already              
              committed to this program.  It could have a major impact on                    
              improving the efficiency of the metal working industries in the                
              United States.
