Abstract    :
                   The principal objective of the project is the calculation                 
              of relativistic and quantum electrodynamic corrections to the                  
              energy levels of He-like ions using sophisticated variational                  
              and numerical techniques.  Rates of convergence will be                        
              investigated as well as novel methods for relativistic                         
              corrections.  The common thread running through the work is                    
              the application of mathematical and analytical ideas to effect                 
              great improvements in computational techniques.
