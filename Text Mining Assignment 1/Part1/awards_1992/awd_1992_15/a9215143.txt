Abstract    :
                   Prior research in modeling software failure rates has  been based on
              mathematical models of hardware reliability.  These models do not reflect the
              measurable, internal  characteristics of the software systems.  One measurable 
              characteristic of software, its complexity, has been shown to  correlate well
              with measures of software failure.  Thus,  incorporating software complexity
              measures into existing  reliability models provides substantial improvement in 
              their accuracy.  Creating a mathematical model of software reliability is 
              similar to creating a hypothesis for a scientific experiment:  the model must
              be validated through experimentation.  In this  research, data collected during
              the development of the Space  Shuttle onboard flight systems provides an
              experimental  project in which the hypothesized reliability models are 
              studied.  One of the most important aspects in the comparison  of different
              reliability models is their predictive quality.  The goal of software
              reliability modeling is to predict the  future failure behavior of software
              using past and present  data.  New reliability models with relative and
              functional  complexity are compared to existing models in terms of their 
              predictive quality and quality of fit.
