Abstract    :
                   This award provides infrastructure support for the development            
              of the research and educational activities  in the Department of               
              Mathematics and Computer Sciences at the University of Puerto Rico,            
              Rio Piedras Campus.  The program will have a graduate component,               
              including a new Ph.D. program, as well as undergraduate and                    
              precollege activities.  The support includes computing resources,              
              as well as personnel to support the program.  In its initial                   
              phases, there will be an emphasis in research in the areas of (1)              
              computer algebra, (2) discrete mathematics for computer science,               
              and (3) numerical methods.//
