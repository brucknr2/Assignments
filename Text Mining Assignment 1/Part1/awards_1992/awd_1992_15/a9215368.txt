Abstract    :
                   This research will focus on developing a science base for                 
              manufacturing system operation and design is founded on a                      
              consistent, systematic hierarchical framework.  The goal of the                
              project is to extend this framework by means of observation,                   
              experimentation, and analysis.  The approach treats the operations             
              of a production system as a control problem, and uses notions from             
              control theory and engineering to develop operation policies.  Such            
              potentially disruptive events as machine failures, material                    
              shortages, and worker absences change the short term capacity of               
              the system.  They are used as signals for the recalculation of                 
              short term schedules. The stochastic scheduling problem is                     
              hierarchically decomposed so that the recalculations are fast,                 
              affect only the necessary parts of the production system, and bring            
              the system as close as possible to production and performance                  
              targets.                                                                       
                   The significance of this research is the development of more              
              effective and reactive production control and scheduling                       
              technology.  The ability to produce flexible schedules which can               
              reflect the changing needs of the factory floor is extremely                   
              important to industry.
