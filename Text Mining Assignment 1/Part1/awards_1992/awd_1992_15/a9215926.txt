Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Miscible polymer blends are of interest as materials in their             
              own right and for implementing strategies for compatibilizing                  
              multiphase mixtures.  This research deals with the opportunities               
              for designing miscible polymer  pairs when one or both components              
              are copolymers.  A modern equation-of-state approach is likely to              
              provide a rational theory that can make predictions from minimal               
              information.  This research integrates polymer synthesis,                      
              characterization (molecular, thermal, volumetric, etc), and careful            
              phase-diagram determination into a scheme that allows calculation              
              of interaction energies (stripped of the complicating effects of               
              compressibility) for  various pairs of monomer repeat units, even              
              when they energetically resist mixing.  The focus is on a variety              
              of polycarbonates, copolymers formed from styrene, methyl                      
              methacrylate, acrylonitrile, and polymers containing functionally              
              reactive monomers.  The goals are to perfect this scheme, to                   
              produce a reliable matrix of binary interaction energies that will             
              allow accurate design of miscible blends from multicomponent                   
              polymers, and to identify blend concepts that will be useful                   
              especially in the area of reactive compatibilization.                          
                                                                                             
                   This research will help the growing field of polymer mixtures,            
              which are increasingly being used as engineering plastics and are              
              also commonly found in recycled plastics.  A better understanding              
              of the fundamentals underlying these uses is essential to further              
              progress.
