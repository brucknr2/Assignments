Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  A synthesis of multibeam data from the Juan de Fuce ridge,                
              Mid-Atlantic rise, and digital database accessible over Internet.              
              A series of interactive tools engaged via a graphical user                     
              interface will allow the user to query, browse, and display as                 
              imagery files or sets of files within the database. Files can be               
              transferred from the database to the user's local site                         
              electronically. Services for map   generation, map printing,                   
              gridding, file conversion and file copying to other media will be              
              offered.
