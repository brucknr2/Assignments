Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This project supports a workshop for the member institutions              
              of the Association of Departments of Computer Science and                      
              Engineering at Minority Institutions (ADMI).  The workshop will                
              concentrate on research and education issues in computer science               
              and engineering, including sessions designed to help initiate                  
              research program, and improve instruction.  An additional effort               
              will be undertaken by the organization to provide sessions, and                
              support for a group of individuals from Native American                        
              Institutions.  The Computer Research Association (CRA) will be an              
              active partner in the program of the workshop.
