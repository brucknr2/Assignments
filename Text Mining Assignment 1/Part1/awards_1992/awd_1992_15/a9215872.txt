Abstract    :
              This project, funded by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                        
              Organometallic Chemistry Program, focusses on several aspects                  
              of the chemistry of complexes that contain the ruthenium-                      
              pentamethylcyclopentadienylnitrosyl moiety.  Specific                          
              objectives include 1) the investigation of carbon-carbon bond                  
              formation in alkyl-chloromethyl complexes, 2) generation of                    
              alkyl complex cations (by protonation of dialkyl precursors)                   
              and the study of their reactions with nucleophiles such as                     
              water, amines, alkynes, olefins and CO, 3) generation of the                   
              rutheniumpentamethylcyclopentadienylnitrosyl dication and                      
              examination of its reactions with nucleophiles.  The                           
              information obtained from these studies are expected to provide                
              insight into C-C and C-E (E = N, O) bond formation, alpha and                  
              beta migratory insertion and elimination processes, oxidative                  
              addition/reductive elimination of C-H bonds, and catalytic                     
              oxidation of alcohols.

              This project involves the study of the fundamental reactivity                  
              properties of a class of organoruthenium compounds.  The                       
              results of this work are expected to impact several types of                   
              catalytic reactions of significant technological importance.
