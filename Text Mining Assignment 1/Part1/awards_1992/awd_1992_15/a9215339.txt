Abstract    :
              Techniques using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning                    
              tunnelling microscopy (STM) are applied to the investigation of                
              platinum and palladium model catalysts.  These methods were                    
              developed during the previous grant to this laboratory.  Three                 
              types of systems are studied:  single crystals, ultrathin films,               
              and microfabricated model catalysts prepared by techniques used                
              in microelectronic device fabrication; the last is an attempt                  
              to control the particle size and morphology of a supported                     
              catalyst.  Catalytic activity and selectivity of these catalysts               
              is measured for the hydrogenation of 1,3 - butadiene.  Adsorbed                
              species are studied  with infrared spectroscopy.  An attempt is                
              made to describe the active sites and to correlate physical and                
              chemical features with activity and selectivity.                               
                                                                                             
              This is a test of the utility of these new methods in catalyst                 
              characterization and design.  The methods are capable of a very                
              high degree of resolution that may (or may not) be helpful in                  
              understanding practical systems.
