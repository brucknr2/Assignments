              Design Education Conference of the American Society of Mechanical              
              Engineers, as well as the follow-on efforts in support of this                 
              conference that will: bring about urgently needed changes in

              experiences of those who have made exemplary curricular                        
              innovations in design; and to identify unanswered questions                    
              calling for research and an in-depth study of design in the                    
              curriculum.
