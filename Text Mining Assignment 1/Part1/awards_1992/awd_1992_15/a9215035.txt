Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project supports the purchase of a small outboard motor boast             
              for field logistics of NSF scientists and other visiting scientists            
              at the Smithsonian Institution's field station on Carrie Bow Cay on            
              the barrier reef of southern Belize.  The Carrie Bow Station is the            
              core support facility for the Caribbean Coral Reef Ecosystems                  
              program administered by the National Museum of Natural History.  At            
              present, the two small Boston Whalers (13 and 15 ft) at the                    
              facility are assigned to Smithsonian researchers as a priority.                
              This new boat (23 ft) is needed to relieve the management                      
              obligations of the Smithsonian field station that is shared my many            
              NSF scientists, to ensure NSF scientists adequate field support and            
              safety, and to allow NSF scientists essential access to specific               
              study sites on the barrier reef.
