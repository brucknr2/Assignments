Abstract    :
              This award provides partial support for a three month research                 
              visit by Dr. Wick Haxton of the University of Washington to                    
              Australia in order to collaborate with Dr. Bruce H. J. McKellar                
              of Melbourne University.  This visit is in exchange for the visit              
              in early 1992 by Prof. McKellar to the University of Washington.               
              Both investigators are acknowledged experts in weak interaction                
              phenomenon, and this visit will extend the collaborative research              
              on several topics in weak interactions.                                        
                                                                                             
              The investigators intend to collaborate on the theory of atomic                
              electric dipole moments with the goal of defining the                          
              relationship between measurements and the parameters of the                    
              underlying CP (charge/parity) violating Lagrangian.  They also                 
              intend to consider current treatments of the parity-nonconserving              
              NN (neutron/neutron) interaction in view of recent chiral                      
              Lagrangian arguments that S-quark components in the nucleon lead               
              to new interactions, including important three-body nuclear                    
              terms.
