Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dynamical evidence shows that most of the mass in disk                         
              galaxies lies in some form of unseen matter, the nature and                    
              distribution of which is largely unkown.  The dynamics of                      
              polar-ring galaxies, which have outer rings of gas, stars,                     
              and dust orbiting in a plane perpendicular to their rotating                   
              central disks, provide one of the few observational tests                      
              available to determine whether the dark matter lies in a                       
              spherical halo, a thin disk, or something in between.  Work                    
              to be supported by this grant will be devoted to using these                   
              galaxies as means for examining the distribution of dark                       
              matter in galaxies.                                                            
                                                                                             
              The Principal Investigator is a highly regarded expert in                      
              this field.
