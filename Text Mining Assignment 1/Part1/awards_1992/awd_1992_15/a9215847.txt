Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to develop an understanding of               
              the microstructural aspects of contaminated clays. Specific                    
              objectives are: 1. to quantify the physical adsorption of                      
              contaminants by clay particles; 2. to quantify the change in                   
              physico-chemical forces between clay particles as a result of                  
              change in pore fluid chemistry; 3. to investigate the change in                
              fabric resulting from the change in physico-chemical forces; 4.                
              to investigate the change in engineering properties resulting                  
              from the above factors. The properties investigated are physical               
              adsorption, stress-strain strength relation, compressibility and               
              hydraulic conductivity.
