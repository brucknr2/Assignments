Abstract    :
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                      
              research program directed by Professor Robert S. Sheridan at                   
              the University of Nevada Reno.  Photochemical generation of                    
              biradicals in matrices and in solution will be examined.  The                  
              mechanism of decomposition of the azo precursors to                            
              meta-photoaddition biradicals will be studied in order to                      
              determine the structural features which dictate stepwise versus                
              concerted partitioning on the reaction surface.  Experiments                   
              designed to determine if hot molecule reactions are important                  
              in matrices and in solution will be conducted.  Photochemical                  
              pathways to didehydroaromatic biradicals will also be explored.

              The interaction of light with highly energetic molecules                       
              trapped at low temperature in solid matrices will be examined.                 
              The low temperature matrix will prolong the lifetime of                        
              reactive species formed in these photochemical reactions by                    
              effectively isolating these reactive intermediates from each                   
              other.  The effect of adding more energy than necessary to form                
              these reactive intermediates will be carefully examined.  These                
              studies will provide important information on the decomposition                
              pathways of highly energetic molecules and intermediates.
