Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Under a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER), an                        
              experiment will be conducted to examine the acoustic                           
              characteristics of a large and complex numerical data set. The                 
              intent is to explore acoustic rather than visual post-                         
              processing of certain numerical simulations. These simulations                 
              model compressible turbulent shear layers at both high and low                 
              Mach numbers. Data will be fed into a sound system and                         
              listened to. It is expected that differences in organized                      
              vortex structures and instability modes will led to                            
              identifiable acoustic signatures.                                              
                                                                                             
              The mixing properties of compressible shear layers are                         
              important for high speed propulsion systems. The novel                         
              diagnostic system may also lead to widely applicable new                       
              methods for the post-processing of complex data bases.
