Abstract    :
              The use of short-pulse lasers has generated new techniques to                  
              fabricate sophisticated microstructures and to synthesize                      
              advanced materials. These techniques have made tremendous                      
              impacts on the microelectronics industry. To improve the                       
              design and quality control of these techniques, a research                     
              plan is proposed to gain understanding of energy deposition                    
              and transport during short-pulse laser-material interactions                   
              and in microstructures. The work will develop more appropriate                 
              macroscopic models for energy deposition and transport                         
              processes by characterizing microscopic transport and                          
              interactions of energy carriers (e.g. electrons and phonons).                  
              Experimental investigation of sub-picosecond laser heating                     
              will also be carried out. The objective of the research                        
              program is to achieve a better understanding of the                            
              fundamental heat transfer mechanisms in different time scale                   
              regimes and to establish analytical framework for modelling                    
              fast laser heat of complex microsctructures.
