Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The principal U.S. participants in this project are Prof.                      
              Peter Tandy of Kent State University and Dr. Craig Roberts of                  
              Argonne National Laboratory. Also associated with the project are              
              Dr. Michael Frank from Hampton University and Dr. David Kahana,                
              an NSF-supported post-doctoral associate at Kent State                         
              University. The primary Australian participants are Prof.                      
              Bruce McKellar of the University of Melbourne and Dr.                          
              Reginald Cahill of the Flinders University of South Australia.                 
              This award will provide travel support over a two year period                  
              for the American participants to visit the laboratories of the                 
              Australian colleagues.                                                         
                                                                                             
              The cooperative research to be undertaken is in the area of                    
              non-perturbative studies in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) and                   
              QCD modelling.  The experimental work will probe issues in                     
              nuclear dynamics that have no clear separation between baryon-                 
              meson degrees of freedom and quark-gluon degrees of freedom.                   
              Important tools for addressing such issues are effective QCD                   
              models of hadron dynamics. The topics to be investigated include               
              the determination of the structure of the quark propagator                     
              through study of the QCD Schwinger-Dyson equations, the                        
              construction of covariant, confining models of QCD based on these              
              studies, the quark structure and interactions of baryons and                   
              mesons in such models and the electroweak couplings and form                   
              factors of these quark and quark-antiquark composites. The                     
              exchange visits by Drs. McKellar and Cahill are being supported                
              through the Australian Department of Industry, Technology and                  
              Commerce (DITAC).
