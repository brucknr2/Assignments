Abstract    :
                   This research program is two years in duration and involves               
              the development of a novel photofragmentation-laser induced                    
              fluorescence technique for the study of hydroperoxyl (HO2) radical             
              kinetics under atmospheric conditions.  It builds on a demonstrated            
              capability to detect hydroxyl (HO) radicals with high sensitivity              
              in laboratory kinetic studies.  A single pulsed laser system will              
              be used to photodissociate HO2, generating OH photofragments which             
              will then be detected by laser induced fluorescence.  Laser flash              
              photolysis will be used to generate HO2.                                       
                   Initial work will focus on determining the optimal HO                     
              detection scheme to maximize sensitivity and minimis interferences.            
              Four potential HO2 production  schemes will be used to study the               
              kinetics  of the reaction of the hydroperoxyl radical with nitric              
              oxide.
