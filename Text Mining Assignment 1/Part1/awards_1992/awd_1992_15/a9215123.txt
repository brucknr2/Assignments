Abstract    :
              The physical properties of the high temperature cuprate                        
              superconductors are investigated on the basis of Holstein-Hubbard              
              theoretical models which include local Coulomb correlations,                   
              antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations and electron-phonon                        
              interactions in a unified theoretical framework.  Our basic                    
              approach combines classical and quantum Monte Carlo and molecular              
              dynamics techniques, exact Lanczos electron groundstate energy and             
              spectral function calculations, mean-field/variational and self-               
              consistent diagrammatic techniques in a novel simulational method.             
              The objective of this research is to study the interplay between               
              Coulomb correlations, antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations and                  
              electron-phonon coupling in doped cuprates, including cooperative              
              effects such as Coulomb-and spin-fluctuation-induced polaron                   
              formation, the polaronic tunneling dynamics, polaronic large-                  
              amplitude lattice displacement fluctuations, and their                         
              manifestations in the observable normal and superconducting state              
              electronic and structural properties at finite dopant densities.               
              The results of this research will provide us with a detailed                   
              quantitative understanding of a possible, qualitatively new low-               
              energy physics which can arise from such cooperative effects.                  
              %%%                                                                            
              The proposed theoretical research deals with models for the new                
              high temperature superconductors.  Detailed, highly complex, models            
              of these materials which take into account the electronic,                     
              structural and magnetic properties and their interactions are used             
              to predict the behavior of the materials in both the                           
              superconducting and normal states.
