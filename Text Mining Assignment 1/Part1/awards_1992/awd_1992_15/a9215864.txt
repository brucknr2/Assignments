Abstract    :
                   This project is a planning study to develop a five-year  plan             
              for a collaborative research program conducted by the Hazardous                
              Substance Management Research Center (HSMRC) at the New Jersey                 
              Institute of Technology in Newark, NJ, the Center for Process                  
              Analytical Chemistry (CPAC) at the University of Washington in                 
              Seattle, WA, to perform research and develop and demonstrate new               
              technologies for the prevention, treatment and remediation of                  
              hazardous substances.  A key component of the research program will            
              be the development and application of innovative measurement                   
              technologies to improve process control and monitoring, leading to             
              optimization and cost-effective hazardous substance management                 
              technologies.                                                                  
                   The proposed collaborative research program affords the                   
              opportunity to link the facilities and capabilities of two National            
              Science Foundation Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers            
              (I/UCRCs), each one having a defined technical focus, along with               
              their industrial partners, to assist DOE's Environmental                       
              Restoration and Waste Management (EM) Program.  A unique feature of            
              the proposed program is the ability to actively involve industry in            
              the program.  Furthermore, this collaboration will be strengthened             
              by other ongoing CPAC and HSMRC research projects with DOE                     
              facilities, including:  Sandia and Los Alamos National                         
              Laboratories, Westinghouse Hanford and Savannah River Sites, and               
              (Battelle) Pacific Northwest Laboratories.                                     
                   The Principal Investigators and colleagues have the experience            
              and capabilities to perform this study.                                        
                   The Department of Energy's Environmental Restoration and Waste            
              Management Program is providing the primary support for this                   
              project.                                                                       
                   The Program Manager recommends the New Jersey Institute of                
              Technology be awarded $125,000 for one year for this project as                
              partial funding.  (The remaining funding will be given as a                    
              unilateral award in FY93).
