Abstract    :
                   Research in electromagnetic excitation of nucleon                         
              resonances will be carried out at CEBAF using a large,                         
              superconducting, torroidal field spectrometer.  CEBAF staff                    
              and members of a large user collaboration, including James                     
              Madison University, will build this device.  Calibration and                   
              monitoring instrumentation will be developed by JMU for the                    
              shower counter system of this spectrometer.  The related                       
              hardware and software will be developed at the JMU campus,                     
              which will later be integrated into the full detector system.                  
              Data obtained with this detector will determine the structure                  
              and decay properties of various nucleon resonances, including                  
              the 1535 and 1710 MeV states.  Comparison with current QCD                     
              inspired models of the nucleon will be made.  Undergrads will                  
              be involved in this research.
