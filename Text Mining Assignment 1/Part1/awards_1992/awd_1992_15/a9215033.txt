Abstract    :
              This study will contribute to our understanding of the full range              
              of natural "sunscreens" that marine organisms have to protect                  
              themselves against ultraviolet (UV) radiation.  With concerns about            
              increased incident UV caused by global ozone depletion, it is                  
              crucial to evaluate the ecological effects of this atmospheric                 
              phenomenon on biological systems in Antarctica.  Mycosporine-like              
              amino acids (MAAs) absorb radiation from the UV portion of the                 
              solar spectrum and are commonly found in marine species.                       
              Scientific information obtained on MAAs will further our                       
              understanding of how marine organisms deal with UV exposure and                
              continue to function within their ecosystems.  Little is known                 
              about the regulatory mechanism of MAAs production in phytoplankton             
              or the mode by which such compounds accumulate in animal tissue.               
              Dr. Karentz proposes to determine if changes in MAA concentration              
              represents an adaptive response to UV exposure and to examine the              
              possible relationships between MAA content in primary producers and            
              their consumers.  The research will be accomplished by comparing               
              MAA concentrations in selected algal and invertebrate species at               
              different times during the annual springtime gradients of                      
              increasing day length and ozone depletion, during different life               
              cycle stages, and under controlled light and food conditions.
