Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A two-day planning workshop will be held in Washington, DC, to                 
              consider in detail the current state of undergraduate cognitive                
              science education and to issue recommendations for future                      
              directions.  The workshop was initially suggested in the final                 
              report of the 1991 planning workshop for the cognitive science                 
              initiative at the National Science Foundation.  It will be attended            
              by approximately sixteen representatives of the cognitive science              
              community, drawn from colleges, universities, and industry, as well            
              as by program personnel from NSF and other government agencies.  A             
              survey of existing cognitive science programs will be conducted                
              prior to the workshop.  The workshop will consider ways to bring               
              more intellectual coherence to the cognitive science major, the                
              role of introductory courses in student recruitment, the role of               
              computational resources in undergraduate programs, the implications            
              of new developments in cognitive science research for the                      
              undergraduate curriculum, and the role of various kinds of faculty             
              and student development programs in the improvement of                         
              undergraduate cognitive science education.  The final report will              
              issue recommendations for the future development of cognitive                  
              science education, and working subgroups of participants will be               
              formed to pursue some of the recommendations.
