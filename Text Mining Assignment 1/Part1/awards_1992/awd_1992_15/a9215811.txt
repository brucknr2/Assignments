Abstract    :
                   The objective of this project is to use individual ship                   
              reports from the COADS Compressed Marine Reports 5 to produce a                
              global, high resolution data base for observational and modeling               
              studies of the atmosphere-ocean system.  In addition to basic                  
              quantities such as wind, sea surface temperature and humidity, this            
              data set will include estimates of surface wind stress, latent and             
              sensible heat fluxes, and short and long wave radiation fluxes.                
              Particular attention will be paid to correct known biases                      
              associated with erroneous Beaufort scale and adjustment of the                 
              anemometer height to a standard 10 m reference level.                          
                   The data sets will be produced in two different resolutions:              
              1) Global monthly mean summaries with 10 longitude by 10 latitude              
              resolution, anomalies and climatology from 1945 to 1989;  and 2)               
              Global weekly mean summaries with 0.50 longitude by 0.50 latitude              
              resolution, climatology form 1965 to 1989.  These summaries will               
              then be globally analyzed by essentially the same objective                    
              analysis scheme used in Levitus' Climatological Atlas of the World             
              Oceans (1982).  Raw monthly/weekly statistics will be made                     
              available to those users desiring to perform their own objective               
              analysis.                                                                      
                   All products will be made widely available to the national and            
              international scientific and operational communities with no                   
              restrictions.                                                                  
                   This project will provide better and more valuable data                   
              products for the use of the scientific community for observational             
              studies of atmosphere-ocean system as well as forcing of the                   
              oceanic general circulation models, for air-sea interaction studies            
              from interannual to decadal time scales, both in the tropics and/or            
              extratropics and provide a more accurate surface marine climatology            
              than presently exists.
