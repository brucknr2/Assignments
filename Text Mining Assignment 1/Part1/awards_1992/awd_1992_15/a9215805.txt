Abstract    :
              The purpose of this research is to develop a fully three-                      
              dimensional, physically based constitutive relation for amorphous              
              polymers.  This will be used to perform numerical simulations of               
              cold and warm deformation processes, the results of which will                 
              then be compared to experiments performed in the laboratory of                 
              the PI.  Additionally, the fundamental mechanisms of deformation-              
              induced heating and the recovery behavior of polymers will also                
              be examined through the use of mechanical testing and                          
              differential scanning calorimetry as well as deformation                       
              calorimetry.//
