Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              Why do adolescents engage in different types of activities?  Why               
              do some work hard on their school subjects while others get                    
              involved in other activities, including problem behaviors?  Do                 
              these activity choices relate to the educational, vocational, and              
              family options they pursue in their early twenties?  This is a                 
              longitudinal follow-up to an existing large scale data set.                    
              These investigators have developed a theoretical framework to                  
              investigate such questions and have used this model to study the               
              ontogeny of education and role-related choices during adolescence              
              in a sample of 2380 youths.  This project follows this sample as               
              they make the transition into adulthood and will assess the                    
              utility of the framework for predicting adult role choices and                 
              look at the long term sequelae of adolescent behavior patterns                 
              and social experiences.  Two types of data will be collected.  A               
              telephone interview will be conducted, and data will be merged                 
              with questionnaire data collected with other support.  These data              
              will then be used to test basic theoretical predictions.
