Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Technical Narrative:                                                           
                                                                                             
              This U.S.-Jordan collaborative research project involving Iowa                 
              State University and Applied Science University, Amman, Jordan will            
              explore the nuclear equation of state.  Project funding will enable            
              Dr. Mahmoud Hasan of Applied Science University to spend a total of            
              six months in the laboratory of Dr. James Vary at Iowa State                   
              University.  Their collaborative research will investigate atomic              
              nuclei under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature.  This             
              work has applications in both heavy-ion physics and astrophysics.              
                                                                                             
              This project in theoretical physics fulfills the program objective             
              of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in               
              the United States and Jordan to combine complementary talents and              
              pool research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and                 
              competence.
