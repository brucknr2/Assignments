Abstract    :
                   The grant is for the PI to participate in an experiment                   
              at Fermilab in which protons and anti protons are accelerated                  
              and allowed to collide at the highest energy possible anywhere                 
              in the World.  The reaction products of these collisions are                   
              measured in a large detector, fabricated and operated by a                     
              collaboration of over 250 physicists from 31 institutions from                 
              around the World.  A primary goal of the experiment is to                      
              observe fundamental particles, not seen before, such as the                    
              top quark, and also decays of particles such as b quarks which                 
              have been seen.  The investigator also will participate in an                  
              even larger experiment at higher energy at the Superconducting                 
              Super Collider (SSC) when it is built a few years from now.
