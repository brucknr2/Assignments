Abstract    :
                   The interaction of laser light with atoms is investigated                 
              theoretically using both perturbative and non-perturbative                     
              techniques.  Excitation, ionization and the generation of                      
              radiation at other than the primary wavelength are considered.                 
              Mathematical and computational methods are developed and                       
              applied to treat the strong coupling of laser radiation with                   
              matter and its dependence on the details of the atomic                         
              structure.
