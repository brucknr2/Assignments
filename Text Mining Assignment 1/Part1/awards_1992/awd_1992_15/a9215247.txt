Abstract    :
              The process of surface diffusion is the focus of this research                 
              project supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry                      
              Program.  In this work Professor George, who has pioneered the                 
              application of laser induced thermal desorption methods for the                
              study of surface diffusion, will extend his studies to                         
              anisotropic and coverage dependent diffusion using a newly                     
              developed linear diffraction technique.  This laser induced                    
              transient grating method promises to provide wider                             
              applicability, and the possibility of monitoring diffusion over                
              a much wider coverage range than previously possible.  These                   
              methods will be applied to the study of small molecule                         
              diffusion on bimetallic surfaces, long chain hydrocarbon                       
              diffusion on ruthenium, and to the study of molecular diffusion                
              on ice surfaces.

              An understanding of the mechanism and rates of surface                         
              diffusion of molecules is essential to the understanding of the                
              dynamics of reactions on surfaces.  Newly developed transient                  
              grating methods will be applied to the study of a range of                     
              molecular adsorbates on well characterized surfaces, providing                 
              much needed information for the understanding of catalytically                 
              relevant surface reactions.
