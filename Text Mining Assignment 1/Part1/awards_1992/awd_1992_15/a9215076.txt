Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to investigate new                           
              techniques for the control design of flexible AC                               
              transmission system (FACTS) devices for the                                    
              mitigation of multiple interarea modes of                                      
              oscillations.  The focal point of the investigation is                         
              the design of damping controllers which are robust                             
              with respect to variations in loading conditions and                           
              system configurations.  By modeling the changes in                             
              operating conditions as uncertainties, the robust                              
              damping controller design will be formulated as and                            
              H00 robust stability problem.  A multi-modal                                   
              decomposition based on synchronizing and damping                               
              torques will be used to provide an appropriate                                 
              design structure to establish non-conservative                                 
              uncertainty models.                                                            
              The proposal consists of the following research                                
              areas: (l) development of the multi-modal                                      
              decomposition, (2) FACTS device siting and                                     
              feedback signal selection, (3) development of                                  
              uncertainty models, (4) computation of multi-modal                             
              decomposition in large power systems, (5) robust                               
              control design of a single FACTS device, and (6)                               
              robust decentralized control coordination of                                   
              multiple FACTS devices.  It is anticipated that a                              
              rigorous robust control design methodology based                               
              on synchronizing and damping torques for multiple                              
              swing modes will developed.  The technique will                                
              appeal directly to power system control design                                 
              engineers.  The power system models will set up                                
              using the Power System Toolbox developed by the                                
              proposer.  The control design process will be                                  
              investigated using Matlab.  Design examples will be                            
              solicited from utilities and equipment                                         
              manufacturers.
