Abstract    :
              The ultimate goal of this project is to develop Computer-Aided                 
              Value Engineering (CAVE) technology to automate, support or                    
              otherwise leverage the process of recommended more cost-effective              
              alternative facility designs.  One unexplored way to generate                  
              more reliable alternative designs is to utilize the owner's and                
              designer's performance and functional intent.  The specific                    
              objective of this project is to couple artificial intelligence                 
              techniques with computer-aided design technology to aid in the                 
              elicitation, representation, and manipulation of implicit intent               
              with the purpose of generating and pricing within a life-cycle                 
              context plausible value engineering design alternatives.  Value                
              Engineering is a process which if properly employed can help the               
              US Architecture-Engineering-Construction industry regain its                   
              world-wide cost effectiveness.  CAVE technology is anticipated to              
              influence the value engineering discipline as much as CAD                      
              technology has influenced the facility design process.
