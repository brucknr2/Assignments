Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Foraminifera are major primary producers of organic carbon and                 
              sinks of nutrients and carbonate in ocean waters.  Although all                
              foraminifera contain one of a wide variety of algal symbionts, the             
              diatom-bearing larger foraminifera are a unique form of the                    
              symbiotic phenomenon.  However, the biological basis for the broad             
              adaptation of foraminifera to symbiosis remains unknown.  This                 
              project will test several testable hypotheses to understand the                
              molecular basis whereby these marine protists recongnize specific              
              algal species as endosymbionts and others as food.  Previous                   
              research has already identified the fibrous net outside of the                 
              foraminifera shell as the contact site for recognition.  The goal              
              of this project is to compare the surface antigens of endosymbiotic            
              and free-living diatoms as possible recognition sites for the                  
              initial steps in the pathways leading to the establishment of                  
              endosymbiosis or digestion.  Immunochemical techniques will be used            
              to screen cross-reactive antigens of diatoms that are involved in              
              the interaction of diatoms with foraminifera.
