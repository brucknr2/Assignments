Abstract    :
                   This project will develop methods for approximations and                  
              solution procedures for multiperiod stochastic programs.  The                  
              project will continue to develop and use realistic models from a               
              variety of areas, including manufacturing, finance, vehicle                    
              routing, and energy policy.  The major goals are to obtain                     
              practical solutions with known error characteristics efficiently.              
                   These goals will be accomplished through the development of               
              new decomposition and interior point methods for distributed                   
              processors, new bounds on the value of the stochastic solution,                
              new techniques for bounding stochastic nonlinear programming                   
              problems, and new approximations using parametric solutions and                
              continuous distribution approximations.  These methods will be                 
              assessed with the ongoing development of the stochastic programming            
              model library.  Comparisons will consider alternative approaches               
              with computational effort, error analyses, and values of                       
              information and model complexity.
