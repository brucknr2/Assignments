Abstract    :
                   This project funds a series of research sessions and summary              
              workshop to consider new paradigms in hierarchy theory for                     
              complex ecological systems.  The work focuses on questions of                  
              changes in scale and observational criteria in communities,                    
              ecosystems, population and landscapes.  The work generate new                  
              categories for ecological systems.  Theorizing revolves around                 
              scaling issues and the use of hierarchical concepts to order                   
              ecological systems.  One of the foci will be the issues of                     
              mapping across changes in scale and type in ecology and will be                
              linked to the development of theory for the management of                      
              ecological systems.
