Abstract    :
                   This effort supports various activities related to the                    
              National Center for Education Statistics' (NCES) Integrated                    
              Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), to promote data                   
              comparability between agencies and improve the quality of data.                
              The NCES' IPEDS data will provide the National Science Foundation              
              (NSF) an essential portion of the statistics needed to establish               
              comprehensive information on undergraduate education.  IPEDS                   
              collects data from all institutions and educational organizations              
              whose primary purpose is to provide postsecondary education,                   
              including much of the information that is needed from baccalaureate            
              and higher institutions, and it is the only source of comprehensive            
              data from two-year institutions.  The current proposal will allow              
              the Foundation to acquire detailed data for each postsecondary                 
              institution at an early date and to participate in the design of               
              data editing criteria.
