Abstract    :
                   The objective of this project is to develop and test a theory-            
              based, quantitative and operationally efficient methodology which              
              would enable industry to predict, assess and develop the knowledge             
              and skills required of manufacturing personnel, concurrently with              
              the design and development of manufacturing technologies.  Specific            
              techniques will be developed to assess human knowledge, skill and              
              ability requirements during the manufacturing systems design phase             
              to improve selection and training of personnel in order that the               
              personnel can be optimally productive when the technology arrives              
              at the workplace.                                                              
                   The conceptual framework for the development of the                       
              methodology is based on the combined information derived from                  
              Fleishman's taxonomy of human abilities, Gange's learning                      
              hierarchy, Anderson's automation of human thought process, Wicken's            
              cognitive resources and Koubek and Salvendy's knowledge structure              
              models.  The conceptual model will be operationalized through the              
              utilization of a computer-based decision flow diagram.  The                    
              development, experimentation, and validation efforts will be                   
              performed in cooperation with the private sector (industry).
