Abstract    :
                   The objective of this research is to develop a high                       
              performance computationally efficient method for real-time                     
              production control of complex manufacturing systems.  Attention                
              will be focused on distributed production control methods that are             
              "guided" by the solution of a continuous flow (fluid) approximation            
              of the production system.  The continuous flow model will                      
              incorporate important production control decisions such as part                
              release, routing, and machine scheduling, and will provide part                
              release and operation-specific production targets for the system               
              over a sufficiently long time.  These targets will guide the actual            
              discrete production control decisions via simple distributed                   
              (local) feedback policies implemented at each machine.                         
                   The vast reduction in computational complexity of the                     
              production control problem achieved by the continuous flow                     
              approximation allows the computation (and updating) of the                     
              continuous production targets in real time.  The actual distributed            
              control decisions require very little computation.  Thus the                   
              approach is expected to provide a viable real-time production                  
              control method.
