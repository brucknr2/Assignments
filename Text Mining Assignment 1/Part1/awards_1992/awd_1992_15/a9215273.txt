Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award provides travel support to Tasmania, Australia,                     
              for Gary A. Laursen of the University of Alaska - Fairbanks                    
              and Steven L. Stephenson of Fairmont State College in                          
              West Virginia. The two American investigators will be                          
              collaborating with Dr. Rodney D. Seppelt of the Australian                     
              Government Antarctic Division in conducting a survey of the                    
              four major groups of fungi on subantarctic Macquarie Island                    
              located between Tasmania and the Antarctic continent.                          
                                                                                             
              The fungal diversity of Macquarie Island is little known.                      
              The occurrence data to be generated through this study will                    
              allow characterization of fungal assemblages, habitat                          
              associations, ecological relationships and biogeographic                       
              patterns, with comparison to northern hemisphere high                          
              latitude fungal assemblages. Collections gathered during                       
              this work, an invaluable resource for future study, will                       
              be suitably housed at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks                    
              and at the Australian Antarctic Division in Tasmania. At                       
              Fairmont State College several students will assist in                         
              preparing and monitoring cultures of dictyostelids and                         
              myxomycetes and in maintaining herbarium specimens.
