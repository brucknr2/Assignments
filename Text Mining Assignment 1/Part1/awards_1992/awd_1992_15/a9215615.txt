Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project brings together Dr. William K. Smith of the                       
              Department of Botany, the University of Wyoming , with his                     
              Australian colleague, Dr. David T. Bell of the Department of                   
              Botany, Western Australian University.  The U.S. PI will spend                 
              approximately six months in 1993 visiting Western Australia.  The              
              proposed research will utilize the flora of southwestern                       
              Australia to test hypotheses regarding the functional                          
              significance of leaf structure to photosynthetic performance.                  
              The cooperative research will test several of the hypotheses                   
              developed by the Dr. Smith under former and continuing NSF                     
              grants, as well as a more comprehensive and synthetic hypothesis               
              that has recently been formulated regarding the existence of                   
              photosynthetic symmetry in plant leaves.  The hypothesis                       
              regarding photosynthetic symmetry may be of fundamental                        
              significance in understanding how leaf structure relates                       
              functionally to photosynthetic performance.                                    
                                                                                             
              The Australian investigator is an authority on leaf morphological              
              and anatomical properties.  The U.S. PI brings to the project an               
              approach that involves some novel and innovative instrumentation               
              for the measurement of functional influences of leaf structure on              
              photosynthesis.
