Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports U.S. participants' travel to a U.S.-Sweden                 
              seminar on urban and regional infrastructure and development                   
              planning to take place in Stockholm, Sweden, July 1-3, 1993.                   
              The principal objective is to bring together twenty-four prominent             
              experts from the USA and Sweden who are currently conducting                   
              leading-edge research into the role of infrastructure networks                 
              (transportation and communication) in urban and regional                       
              development.  The participants will develop a research agenda                  
              and exchange information on research methods, results and                      
              policy conclusions on how infrastructure networks grow and                     
              change and how interacting networks influence urban and                        
              regional development patterns in the long-term.  The                           
              coordinators are Tschangho J. Kim at the University of Illinois                
              and D. F. Batten and Lars Lundqvist of the Royal Institute of                  
              Technology in Stockholm.                                                       
                                                                                             
              This is a very timely seminar.  The problem of infrastructure and              
              its relation to economic and social planning is a high priority for            
              industrialized countries as cities continue to age and deteriorate.            
              The Swedes have long been known as innovative thinkers on                      
              transportation and communication networks in the urban and                     
              regional context.  The U.S. participants bring to the collaboration            
              their expertise on transportation modeling, network analysis,                  
              economic in-put, out-put analysis and urban economics.
