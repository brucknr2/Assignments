Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program                 
              of the Chemistry Division, Dr. M. Morse  of the University of                  
              Utah will investigate the chemical bonding and electronic                      
              structure of diatomic transition metal molecules using                         
              electronic spectroscopy.  The methods include resonant                         
              two-photon ionization, high resolution laser-induced                           
              fluorescence, and dispersed fluorescence spectroscopy.  In all                 
              cases the samples are prepared by pulsed laser vaporization of                 
              a suitable metal target, followed by supersonic expansion with                 
              helium as the carrier gas.  The severe cooling that attends                    
              this expansion brings about significant reductions in the                      
              complexity of the spectra without which their analysis would be                
              prohibitively difficult if not impossible.  The research will                  
              focus on the diatomic molecules of iron, cobalt, titanium,                     
              niobium, tantalum, and platinum, as well as on their mixed                     
              diatomic variants.

              Prof. Morse is recognized as an expert on gas phase transition                 
              metal dimer (and trimer) molecules.  The work is in an area of                 
              great relevance to disciplines ranging from computational                      
              quantum chemistry to the inorganic chemistry  of transition                    
              metal alloys.  The results of this research will be ground and                 
              excited state symmetries, bond strengths, bond lengths, and                    
              vibrational frequencies for the transition metal molecules                     
              studied.  These results in turn provide benchmark data for the                 
              development and testing of reliable quantum chemical models for                
              transition metal molecules.
