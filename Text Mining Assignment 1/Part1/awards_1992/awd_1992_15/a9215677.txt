Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award provides travel support for                                         
              Dr. Christine Borgman and Sandra Goldstein, a                                  
              doctoral student, both from the University of                                  
              California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Graduate School                                 
              of Library and Information Science, to enable                                  
              them to work with a team of colleagues at the                                  
              School of Computer Science and Engineering at                                  
              the University of New South Wales under the                                    
              leadership of Prof. John Hiller. The activity                                  
              allows the two teams to join forces in working                                 
              on complementary projects involving information                                
              processing tasks and draws upon a study                                        
              of children's use of hypertext retrieval                                       
              systems at UCLA and studies of engineers' use                                  
              of computer aided design systems (CAD)                                         
              in Australia.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              The UCLA team will contribute the information                                  
              retrieval expertise and a large body of data                                   
              already available for analysis. The                                            
              Australian team will contribute the computer-                                  
              modeling expertise. Plans are for the                                          
              Australians to visit UCLA in the first half of                                 
              1993 to assist in the design of the Science                                    
              Library Catalog monitoring analysis algorithms                                 
              under the counterpart Australian grant. It is                                  
              expected that the UCLA team will go to                                         
              Australia in August 1993 to further the data                                   
              modeling and conduct a comparative analysis                                    
              thus using the complementary expertise in                                      
              online monitoring of the two teams. Dr Hiller's                                
              work deals with a number of methodological                                     
              issues relevant to studying human-computer                                     
              interaction in general and information in                                      
              particular, including graphical data display                                   
              and expert vs. novice user comparisons.                                        
              Dr. Borgman's expertise is in the analysis of                                  
              transaction logs of information retrieval                                      
              systems and user behavior. Ms. Goldstein's                                     
              work will be incorporated in her dissertation.
