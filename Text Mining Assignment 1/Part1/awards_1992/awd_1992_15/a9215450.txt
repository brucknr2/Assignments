Abstract    :
              Position Measurement (PM) is a vital component in modern                       
              construction practice.  The current technology for PM is                       
              sophisticated but does not accommodate real-time input/output. The             
              focus of this research is to examine the data structure, data                  
              presentation format, data distribution process, and the data                   
              gathering issues as they relate to the broad based integration of              
              Real-time Position Measurement (RtPM) with Computer Aided                      
              Design/Computer Aided Engineering (CAD/CAE).  The research will                
              also study human factors as they relate to implementation including            
              cultural, political, and industrial issues.                                    
                                                                                             
              It is anticipated that the successful introduction of RtPM/CAD-                
              CAE technology will have a very significant economic and quality               
              impact, both in the United States and in enhancing the                         
              competitiveness of U.S. construction firms engaged in global                   
              construction ventures.//
