Abstract    :
                   Professor Oh will continue his work on aspects of                         
              symplectic geometry related to minimal surfaces,mean                           
              curvature flow and Kahler-Einstein manifolds.This work                         
              follows on from spectacular work of Arnold and Floer                           
              concerning the geometry and toplogy of Lagrangian                              
              submanifolds in symplectic geometry.
