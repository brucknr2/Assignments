Abstract    :
                  The objectives of this research are to:  (1) develop tutorial,             
              case study and game-style teaching modules with associated software            
              to illustrate the methodologies for integrated manufacturing and               
              distribution system design and operation for quick response                    
              component suppliers; and (2) distribute these teaching modules to              
              other engineering and business schools and initiate joint                      
              development of enhancements to these materials.                                
                   This research will investigate an integrated strategy for                 
              demand forecasting, production scheduling, and finished goods                  
              inventory stocking that simultaneously achieves high customer                  
              service, high finished goods turnover, and high capacity                       
              utilization.  It is the purpose of the research to demonstrate that            
              such a strategy is possible and can be explained simply.
