Abstract    :
                   This research focuses on decentralized rules for coordinating             
              work in a manufacturing system.  For example, workers might move               
              from station to station, each following a simple rule that tells               
              what to do next.  For properly designed rule sets, global                      
              coordination of the workers can evolve spontaneously from their                
              independent activities.  Thus the production line can be self-                 
              organizing:  without management intervention it constantly                     
              reallocates work to maximize throughput, even under perturbations              
              such as changes in the number of workers or in the time required               
              to perform a task.                                                             
                   This idea is in contradistinction to less flexible means of               
              production, such as the classical assembly line, in which a                    
              centralized authority allocates work by making a one-time                      
              assignment of tasks and workers to stations.  This assignment is               
              then rigidly followed by all workers.  Experiments and validation              
              of results will be carried out in collaboration with industrial                
              laboratories and manufacturing facilities.
