Abstract    :
                   Concurrent engineering strives to perform design activities               
              simultaneously, rather than in series as in the case of traditional            
              design.  This may result in reduction of the duration of the design            
              project, cost savings, and better quality of the final design.  The            
              concurrent strategy, however, might increase the complexity of the             
              design process and make it more difficult to manage.  The aim of               
              this research is to develop a methodology for management of the                
              design process in a concurrent engineering environment.                        
                   The methodology includes the development of a prototype system            
              that will decompose and simplify the design process and reduce the             
              computational time of product development.  Information flow and               
              organizational characteristics of complex design projects will also            
              be analyzed.  The system includes a multi-agent architecture to                
              model the concurrent engineering environment, a negotiation model              
              for conflict resolution and a module to integrate product                      
              modularity concepts with the management of design changes.
