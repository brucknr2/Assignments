Abstract    :
              CTS-9215421   University of Utah   Jan D. Miller      ABSTRACT      The
              objective of this project is to understand the surface  chemistry of deinking
              flotation process for wastepaper recycling  as a basis for improving the
              performance of air-sparged  hydrocyclone (ASH) units in this application. 
              Major problems in   deinking floatation such as separation of ink from the
              fiber  surface during pulping, differences in hydrophobicity of ink due  to  
              oxidation, heterocoagulation of ink particles with fibers, and   entrapment of
              ink particles by entanglement of cellulose fibers  will be addressed. 
              Increased yields and greater brightness of  recycled paper are expected with
              optimal operating conditions for  ASH flotation.      There are significant
              incentives to increase domestic paper  recycling efforts.  As much as 50% of
              the landfill requirement in  the United States derives from paper and paper
              products.  Aside  from the waste disposal problem, paper recycling will
              conserve  trees, water and energy.
