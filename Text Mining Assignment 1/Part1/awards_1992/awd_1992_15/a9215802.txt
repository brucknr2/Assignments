Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of this research is to understand how microscopic                     
              interactions such as bonding, electronic states, order-disorder,               
              vibrational density of states affect macroscopic properties (bulk              
              thermodynamics) in complex inorganic systems, mainly crystalline               
              oxides, perovskite, ilmenite and lithium niobate structures.  High-            
              temperature reaction calorimetry and structural and spectroscopic              
              tools are used to explore why given structures exist.  Emphasis                
              will be placed on the energetics of the metastable materials, both             
              crystalline and amorphous, and on radiation damaged and                        
              mechanically damaged materials.  Ceramic processing will be                    
              examined as well from the point of view of energetics of                       
              intermediate phases formed.
