Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                The primary purpose of the research proposed here is to examine             
              variation in the shape of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) among              
              anthropoid primates in relation to function by evaluating the                  
              hypothesis that the shape of the TMJ is correlated with both the               
              movements of the mandibular condyle and diet.  In order to test                
              this general hypothesis the investigators will dissect the TMJ in              
              a broad range of primates.  Cineradiographic analysis of condylar              
              movements in 4 anthropoid genera (Ateles, Macaca, Papio, and Pan),             
              development of a mechanical model of the TMJ, and quantitative                 
              shape analyses that examine the model in relation to dietary and               
              evolutionary influences in living monkeys and apes will also be                
              carried out.  This is the first study to incorporate in vivo and               
              morphometric results to interpret the functional significance of               
              TMJ shape among extant anthropoids as well as to describe and                  
              quantify condylar movements in a New World monkey (Ateles) and a               
              great ape (Pan).  This study will result in a model and data base              
              of anthropoid TMJ kinematics that may be applied to functional,                
              evolutionary, and adaptive explanations of the anatomy of the TMJ              
              region in fossil anthropoids, including early human ancestors.
