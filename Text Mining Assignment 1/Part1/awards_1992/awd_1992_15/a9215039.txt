Abstract    :
              The University of California at Davis is in the                                
              process of designing an earthquake simulator                                   
              for their National Geotechnical Centrifuge                                     
              (NGC).  The purpose of this award is to                                        
              support a three-person committee to oversee                                    
              the design of this simulator.                                                  
                                                                                             
              The committee members consist of a                                             
              geotechnical engineer having expertise in the                                  
              design, installation and operation of an                                       
              earthquake simulator having the same                                           
              operational principle as the one being                                         
              designed; a structural engineer with expertise                                 
              in the dynamics of structures, especially with                                 
              respect to statistical aspects of the analysis and                             
              performance; and a mechanical engineer                                         
              experienced in the design and analysis of                                      
              rotating devices, including motors and drive                                   
              systems.  The oversight involves technical                                     
              studies and selected experiments, some of                                      
              which are performed by the committee, and                                      
              some by the University of California at Davis.                                 
                                                                                             
              The goals of this committee are to:                                            
                                                                                             
              (a) Examine the operational conditions and                                     
              capabilities of the NGC through calculations of                                
              the modal shapes and frequencies of the entire                                 
              system; as well as through selected experiments                                
              using the instrumented centrifuge;                                             
                                                                                             
              (b) Assess the capabilities of the proposed                                    
              earthquake simulator, acting alone;                                            
                                                                                             
              (c) Examine through experiment and numerical                                   
              simulations the interaction of the mounted                                     
              simulator with the other centrifuge                                            
              components;                                                                    
                                                                                             
              (d) Integrate the above results to assess the                                  
              expected shaking performance of the system                                     
              with the centrifuge rotating, the repeatability                                
              and reliability of the motions generated, the                                  
              safety of the facility, and the effect of the                                  
              operation of the shaking system on the fatigue                                 
              life of the centrifuge.
