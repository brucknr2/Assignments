Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award provides funding to Gregory Snyder of the University                
              of Colorado to assist his work in collaboration with Professor                 
              R.V. Baudinette of the School of Biological Sciences at the                    
              Flinders University of South Australia.  Dr. Snyder is currently               
              supported by the National Science Foundation's Division of                     
              Integrative Biology and Neurosciences to examine the morphometric              
              characteristics of the development of microvascular loops and                  
              whether the countercurrent loops are specific to certain brain                 
              areas in marsupials.  In vertebrates, capillary endothelia or                  
              glia regulate the exchange between blood and the central nervous               
              system (CNS), forming the blood brain barrier. CNS capillaries in              
              marsupials consist of hairpin loops which appear to add another                
              dimension to the blood brain barrier.                                          
                                                                                             
              This project will support the travel of Dr. Snyder to Flinders                 
              University where he will continue his investigations on the                    
              development of the unique microvascular geometry in marsupials                 
              using tammar wallabies. A breeding colony of tammar wallabies is               
              maintained at the School of Biological Sciences. Taking advantage              
              of this colony, the development of microvascular loops in young                
              Joey's during pouch development will be examined.                              
                                                                                             
              The host scientist, Dr. Russell Baudinette, is a recognized                    
              authority on the physiology of marsupials.  The collaborative                  
              work will advance not only the understanding of the relationships              
              between vascular geometry and exchange, but also the adaptations               
              that attend the transition from an aquatic to a terrestrial                    
              existence, and further the understanding of phylogenetic                       
              relationships within vertebrates.
