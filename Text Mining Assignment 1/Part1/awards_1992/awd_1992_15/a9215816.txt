Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This award supports the travel of Dr. James Van                                
              Etten of the University of Nebraska at Lincoln                                 
              to Australia to conduct collaborative research                                 
              with Dr. Jan Rohozinski of the Research School                                 
              of Biological Sciences at the Australian                                       
              National University. The goal of the research                                  
              is to understand the biological function of DNA                                
              methyltransferases and DNA restriction enzymes                                 
              coded by viruses which infect eukaryotic alga.                                 
              Algal viruses are icosahedral DNA containing                                   
              viruses which infect chlorella cells.                                          
              Specifically, the research will attempt to                                     
              establish a transformation system in chlorella                                 
              so that studies of algal viral genes can be                                    
              undertaken.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              Work to develop the transformation system is to                                
              be carried out in Australia at the Australian                                  
              National University in Canberra. Once                                          
              the transformation system is established, the                                  
              cloning of viral genes will be accomplished.                                   
              The facilities at the University of Nebraska                                   
              are recognized as a major center for studying                                  
              these viruses and the restriction modification                                 
              system they encode. The analysis of the                                        
              restriction modification genes, isolated by the                                
              Australian investigators, will be done at the                                  
              University of Nebraska.
