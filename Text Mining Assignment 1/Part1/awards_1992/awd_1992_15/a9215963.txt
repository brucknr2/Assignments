Abstract    :
              This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                  
              chemistry and in the subfield of electroanalytical chemistry.                  
              During the tenure of this three-year continuing grant, Professor               
              Johnson and his students will apply pulsed electrochemical                     
              techniques to the detection of polar and ionic aliphatic organic               
              compounds having biological  significance.  Of particular interest             
              to these studies are amino acids and peptides that contain thiol,              
              disulfide, or thioether moieties.  Such compounds traditionally do             
              not yield to conventional electrochemical analysis at noble metal              
              electrodes because of their electrochemical irreversibility.                   
              However, these functional moieties produce transient anodic                    
              signals at gold and platinum electrodes as a result of                         
              electrocatalytic reactions that occur during the formation of                  
              surface oxides and are thus detectable by pulsed techniques.  This             
              research builds upon accomplishments of the Johnson group under                
              NSF grant CHE-8914700.                                                         
              %%%                                                                            
              Results from this research project will expand fundamental                     
              knowledge of electrocatalytic reaction mechanisms for anodic                   
              processes that result in water-derived oxygen transfer.                        
              Additionally, this research should give rise to significant                    
              advances in detection technology for liquid chromatography wherein             
              conventional photometric and fluorometric detection of the                     
              compounds of interest at levels less than nanomolar requires a                 
              priori chemical derivitization.
