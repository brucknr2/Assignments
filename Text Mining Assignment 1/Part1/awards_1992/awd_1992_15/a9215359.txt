Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This proposed research is to study the air-sea interactions in            
              the warm pool region in the South Pacific using observations taken             
              during the TOGA COARE Intensive Observing Period.  Air-sea fluxes,             
              their variability, parameterization and coupling to the ocean and              
              atmosphere will be determined using turbulence-equipped aircraft.              
              Several unique flight plans are proposed which use 2 or 3 of the               
              aircraft in highly-coordinated flight patterns to measure the                  
              surface variability of the fluxes,  the vertical structure of the              
              boundary layer and the atmospheric sensible heat, moisture, and                
              momentum budgets.  The coupling to the ocean is emphasized with the            
              patterns centered over the TOGA COARE ships and buoys.  The                    
              atmospheric budgets will be determined when possible within the                
              scale of the larger array of radars and island sounding stations.              
              The aircraft sensible heat, moisture, and momentum boundary-layer              
              budgets will be compared to the larger scale budgets estimated from            
              the array of ships and radars to determine the statistical basis of            
              the larger scale budgets.                                                      
                   This research is important because it serves as one of the                
              studies of the TOGA COARE that link air-sea interaction processes              
              to the larger scales that impact climate variability in an                     
              especially climate sensitive region of the world, the western                  
              Pacific Ocean, the field site of TOGA COARE.
