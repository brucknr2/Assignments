Abstract    :
                   The long-term goal of this project is to develop the                      
              functional framework that supports concurrent engineering in design            
              and manufacturing.  The purpose is to shorten the design cycle                 
              time, to increase productivity and, more importantly, to come up               
              with optimum or near-optimum design and production plans.  In order            
              to accomplish this goal, two specific objectives are identified.               
              The first one is to characterize the various mechanical functions              
              for creating the functional structure of a product.  The functional            
              structure will facilitate the integration of the functional                    
              requirements into various activities of the product cycle so as to             
              serve as the links among design, process planning, manufacturing,              
              assembly, and inspection.  The second objective is to develop a                
              functional tolerancing framework based on the characteristics of               
              the required functions.  Using the tolerancing scheme, the current             
              practice of tolerance representation can be extended and applied               
              to the products that are sophisticated in function and/or                      
              complicated in geometry.                                                       
                   The research will result in a systematic approach for the                 
              characterization and representation of the functional requirements             
              in mechanical design.  It will provide a basis for integrating                 
              design intent into the product cycle so that higher level of                   
              decision making and complex reasoning for the determination of                 
              optimum product design and process planning become possible.
