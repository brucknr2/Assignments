Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Two fundamental mechanisms in the mechanics of granular                        
              materials will be studied.  One is the micromechamics of soil                  
              liquefaction under cyclic loading.  The other is the dynamics                  
              of moving sediment layers.  Two primary transport modes will                   
              be examined:  sliding and flowing.  Stability mechanicsm are                   
              suggested as determing the transition between one and the                      
              other.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              The study will lead to a better characterization of soil                       
              response to earthquakes and also the response of granular                      
              seabed material to cyclic loading from surface waves.  In both                 
              cases, liquefaction of the saturated medium has important                      
              structural and geophysical consequences.
