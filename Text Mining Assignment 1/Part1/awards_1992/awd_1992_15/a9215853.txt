Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is a microseismic study of the East Pacific Rise at 9                
              degrees 50 minutes north to provide constraints on shallow magmatic            
              and hydrothermal processes.  The study will locate areas of seismic            
              activity and compare them to seafloor geological features,                     
              determine the depth extent of microseismicity to delimit the region            
              of brittle fracture, and test whether the seismicity is migrating              
              along the ridge. Two deployments of ocean-bottom seismometers will             
              be conducted; the first to delineate regions of high                           
              microseismicity, and the second to provide for accurate hypocenter             
              locations.
