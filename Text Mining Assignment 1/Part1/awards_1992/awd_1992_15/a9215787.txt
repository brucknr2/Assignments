Abstract    :
              The work will study creep crack growth in nickel and iron-nickel               
              based superalloys using HTMI and DIC techniques to obtain crack                
              tip displacements associated with creep crack growth process in                
              the primary and the steady state creep crack growth regimes.  The              
              work will critically evaluate the validity of the creep                        
              parameters such as K, J-integral, Ct, C(t) and C*.
