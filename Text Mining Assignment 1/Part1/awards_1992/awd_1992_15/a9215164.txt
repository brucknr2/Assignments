Abstract    :
              Organic radicals will be prepared in the gas phase and the                     
              corresponding infrared absorption spectra recorded.  In a                      
              separate set of experiments, utilizing a flowing afterglow                     
              apparatus, the reactivity of hydrocarbon radicals in the gas                   
              phase with negative ions will be investigated.  Gas phase                      
              species to be generated and studied include methyl, vinyl,                     
              allyl, allene, phenyl, and benzyl radicals.  The radicals will                 
              be produced via a pyrolysis supersonic jet with a high                         
              temperature nozzle.  A photoionization mass spectrometer will                  
              be employed to follow the pyrolysis effluent at the head of a                  
              zirconia nozzle.                                                               
              %%%                                                                            
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports an                       
              investigation of radicals and biradicals and their reactions                   
              with a variety of species in the gas phase under the direction                 
              of Professor G. B. Ellison at the University of Colorado.  Some                
              of the most reactive species produced during the course of many                
              chemical transformations are radicals, which contain one                       
              unpaired electron, and biradicals, which contain two unpaired                  
              electrons.   Whereas most of the previous work with organic                    
              radicals involved reactions in liquid solutions,  Professor                    
              Ellison will generate reactive radical species in the gas phase                
              with a high temperature nozzle.  The radicals will be exposed                  
              to a stream of charged gas phase molecules and the chemical                    
              subsequent chemical transformations observed directly.                         
              Comparison of the experimental results with computer                           
              simulations will lead to a better understanding of the                         
              reactions of radicals and biradicals.
