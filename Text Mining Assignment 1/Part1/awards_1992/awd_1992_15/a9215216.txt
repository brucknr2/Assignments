Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will help the Department of Chemistry at the Univrsity of                      
              California at Los Angeles acquire an entire new integrated                     
              single crystal x-ray diffractometer and structure analysis                     
              system, with rotating anode generator.  Among the areas of                     
              chemical research that will be enhanced by the acquisition are                 
              the following:                                                                 
                                                                                             
              1.  Host Molecules That Complex and Catalyze                                   
                                                                                             
              2.  Borane Cluster Chemistry                                                   
                                                                                             
              3.  Porphyrin Sponges:  Programmable Lattice Clathrates                        
                                                                                             
              %%%                                                                            
              Single crystal x-ray crystallography is the most powerful                      
              analytical method for structure determination of solids.  In                   
              synthetic inorganic, organic, bioinorganic and organometallic                  
              chemistry, single crystal x-ray diffraction is an invaluable                   
              tool to characterize molecular structure.  The information                     
              gained from the knowledge of the intermolecular composition and                
              structure helps to develop new reactions of potentially general                
              interest in catalysis or organic synthesis.
