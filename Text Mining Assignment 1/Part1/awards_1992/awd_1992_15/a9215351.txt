Abstract    :
                   The primary goal of this project is to conduct an                         
              intercomparison on the measurement of sulfur gases in the air                  
              between various research groups who are measuring the gases.  These            
              gases are of major atmospheric importance, but at this time we do              
              not know if the different analytical instrumentation and methods               
              are equivalent in their measurement capability.  This is due to the            
              variety of preconcentration methods and equipment which are used to            
              measure the gases and to the high reactivity of these sulfur gases             
              with a variety of chemical species in the air, water, soils, etc.              
              This proposal is an omnibus proposal to provide for the logistical             
              support to perform the intercomparison and to analyze the data                 
              generated from the intercomparison.  The experimental design is                
              such that both laboratory and field exercises will be performed and            
              that the range of concentration for intercalibration of each gas               
              will be from about five times the minimum detectable limit of each             
              gas to two orders of magnitude higher.  This range will cover the              
              range of natural measurements (part per trillion by volume to part             
              per billion by volume) and provide an experiment which can provide             
              for good statistical validity in the intercomparison.  A successful            
              intercomparison, with the validation of several research groups to             
              measure sulfur gases, will result in the ability to perform                    
              coordinated research projects to understand the vital role of                  
              sulfur in global climate change.//
