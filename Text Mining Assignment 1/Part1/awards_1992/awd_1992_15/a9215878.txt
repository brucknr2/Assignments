Abstract    :
              Brunvand         This research merges two efforts in asynchronous circuit 
              compilation.  These are the work of Gopalakrishnan on the  language hopCP and
              its use in verification; and the work of  Brunvand on asynchronous circuit
              compilation.  The research is:  1.     enhancing the expressive power as well
              as the semantic  clarity of concurrent hardware description languages for 
              asynchronous circuits and systems;  2.     extending the formal basis for
              compiling from HDL's to  circuit designs;  3.     formally characterizing and
              improving the optimizations used  in asynchronous circuit compilation; and  4. 
                 studying the performance of implemented circuits with regard  to a variety
              of parameters.
