Abstract    :
              Vaidyanathan         This research addresses coding gain optimization in one 
              dimensional paraunitary filter banks. Paraunitary filter banks  include both
              subband and transform coders as extreme special  cases, and have the advantage
              of perfect signal recovery in the  absence of quantization. This approach opens
              up a large class of  problems, some fundamental, in signal processing and in
              systems  theory, all of which are being addressed. A number of properties  of
              the filter bank transformer that parallel traditional Fourier  transform
              properties (e.g., the convolution theorem) are also  being addressed. Again,
              the coding gain optimization for  paraunitary and orthonormal convolvers is
              being addressed. The  above research is also being generalized to nonuniform
              filter  banks (i.e., systems with unequal decimation ratios, as in the  most
              common discrete time wavelet transformers). Finally, several  extensions of
              these ideas to multidimensional multirate systems  are being considered.
