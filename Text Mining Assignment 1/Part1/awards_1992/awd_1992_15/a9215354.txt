Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports cooperation between Chinese                                
              scientists at Tsinghua University and the China                                
              Institute of Atomic Energy with scientists from                                
              Duke University in the investigation of two                                    
              significant issues in low-energy physics.                                      
              Through nucleon-nucleon and neutron-deuteron                                   
              experiments, the research team hopes to provide                                
              high-accuracy information about the nature of the                              
              neutron-nucleus interaction over a wide energy                                 
              range, and about the nature of the nucleon-                                    
              nucleon interaction.                                                           
                                                                                             
              Both China and the U.S. will contribute                                        
              researchers and accelerator time to the project.                               
              The Chinese contribution of beam times at                                      
              energies unreachable at the facilities available                               
              to the Duke researchers is a key element in the                                
              collaboration. Duke researchers will join Chinese                              
              researchers in work at the experimental facility                               
              at the China Institute of Atomic Energy, and                                   
              Chinese researchers will participate in                                        
              experiments and analysis at Duke.
