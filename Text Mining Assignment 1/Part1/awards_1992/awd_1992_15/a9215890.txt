Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of this research is to conduct exploratory synthesis and              
              physical characterization of metal-rich chalcogenides of zirconium,            
              niobium, and tantalum.  Indirect reactions of elemental and binary             
              precursors are used to synthesize ternary compounds at convenient              
              temperatures, less than those obtained by direct methods.  Several             
              synthetic target materials, with a particular focus on compounds               
              having the ?Ta5TaS5! chain, are explored using flux synthesis to               
              lower reaction temperatures while still yielding crystalline                   
              products.  Plans are presented for chalcogenide synthesis using                
              metal-halide-cluster precursors.  Also, new intercalation chemistry            
              involving Ta2Se and Ta1.4Nb0.6S are explored.  The motivations for             
              these exploratory synthesis/characterization are to develop new                
              chemistry or new materials with unusual structures having new and              
              interesting properties.
