Abstract    :
                   This proposal requests support for a one day symposium to be              
              held at the annual meeting of the American Society of Zoologists               
              in Vancouver, Canada in December, 1992.  This meeting is co-                   
              sponsored with the Canadian Society of Zoologists.  The symposium              
              consists of eleven 30-minute presentations.  The speakers take a               
              multidisciplinary approach that cuts across taxonomic and                      
              conceptual lines, namely mammals, lower vertebrates, and                       
              invertebrates; empirical versus theoretical studies; individual                
              level versus population level studies.  Interactions among such a              
              diverse group of researchers should: 1) lead to an assessment of               
              knowledge on the evolution of intraspecific predation and its                  
              impact on a species' population dynamics and its role in its                   
              community 2) identify information gaps 3) delineate new                        
              directions for future research and 4) facilitate the transfer of               
              conceptual and technical information from one sub-discipline to                
              another.  A one day symposium together with contributed paper and              
              poster session is planned; this is an ideal time frame for                     
              assessing progress in a developing area of inquiry.
