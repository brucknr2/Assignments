Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              How do we learn to protect ourselves from approaching danger?  One             
              of the oldest paradigms for studying this kind of learning is                  
              classical Pavlovian conditioning.  In classical conditioning, the              
              repeated presentation of two stimuli together, one that the                    
              organism normally would avoid (the unconditioned stimulus), and one            
              that it does not (the neutral stimulus), leads eventually to the               
              organism trying to avoid the neutral stimulus.  The previously                 
              neutral stimulus has acquired a value -- it has become conditioned.            
              Pavlov thought that the new associations necessary for conditioning            
              occur in the cerebral cortex, that part of the brain devoted to                
              thinking and perception.  Dr. Thompson and his students have shown,            
              surprisingly, that circuits in the cerebellum, not the cerebral                
              cortex, are necessary for conditioning to take place.  In this                 
              renewal of his NSF grant, he will use newly developed reversible               
              inactivation methods to demonstrate that the new associations are              
              actually formed in the cerebellum.  He will then use a variety of              
              sophisticated neurobiological techniques to determine the                      
              mechanisms by which these new memories are stored.  The                        
              investigators have a good chance of being the first to delineate a             
              complete information storing circuit in the mammalian brain.  Their            
              work will further our understanding of human learning and memory               
              and will be also useful to designers of artificial neural nets and             
              teaching machines.***//
