Abstract    :
              This grant is to assist the support of an international symposium              
              on probabilistic structural mechanics and advances in structural               
              reliability methods during June 7-10, 1993, It is to be held in                
              San Antonio, Texas, USA under the auspices of the International                
              Union of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (UTAM). The aim of the              
              symposium is to appraise the state-of-the-art, exchange                        
              information and views, and set direction for new research. It                  
              will facilitate a dialogue between engineers and scientists                    
              working in mechanics and materials, structural mechanics,                      
              structural engineering and construction engineering, and will                  
              simulate new developments and areas of research in the field. The              
              symposium will result in an authoritative high quality                         
              proceedings volume which will serve as a basic reference on the                
              subject of probablistic structural mechanics and structural                    
              reliability.***  //
