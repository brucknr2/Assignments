              value of U.S. EEZ resources to the Nation, 3) areas of policy

              5) opportunities for enhancing U.S. competitiveness.  The                      
              workshop will develop national plan for energizing industry, the               
              university community, and government to find creative solutions                
              to the problems that are inhibiting growth and development in
