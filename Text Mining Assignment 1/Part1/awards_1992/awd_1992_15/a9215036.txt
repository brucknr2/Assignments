              cooperative program to encourage minority undergraduates in their              
              pursuit of professional careers in earth, ocean and environmental              
              sciences. Participants will take part in two summers of supervised             
              scientific research; a summer enrichment program; and two academic             
              years of financial support, regular meetings with faculty mentors,             
              and assistance with graduate school application. Three historically
