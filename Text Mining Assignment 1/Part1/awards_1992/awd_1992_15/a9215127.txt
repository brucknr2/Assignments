Abstract    :
                   The springtime arctic troposphere has been shown to be a major            
              reservoir of many anthropogenically derived pollutants, including              
              nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons.  Based on the available data, it             
              is estimated that the arctic troposphere contains roughly 10% of               
              the global tropospheric burden of NOy during spring.  Additionally,            
              tropospheric ozone concentrations are known to be increasing at                
              about 1-2% per year during spring and summer at high latitudes.                
              The springtime measurements of NO at Borrow, Alaska suggest that               
              photochemical activity and ozone production is possible during the             
              late spring period when NOy and non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC's)              
              are still high, temperatures are warming, and solar intensity is               
              increasing.                                                                    
                   In this study, the PI will further develop and validate                   
              instrumental capabilities for making measurements of the nitrogen              
              oxide species at low ambient mixing ratios.  Once validated, he                
              will focus on gaining an improved understanding of the temporal                
              distribution of NO, NO2 and NOy at Barrow during the spring-summer             
              transition period.  These measurements, along with J(NO2) and O3,              
              can then be used to calculate the O3 production rates and to                   
              evaluate the change in NOy speciation as a function of temperature             
              and solar intensity.
