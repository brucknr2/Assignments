Abstract    :
              This award will support a three-month visit by Dr. Clifford                    
              Fairchild of the Department of Physics, Oregon State University,               
              to Australia where he will participate in collaborative work with              
              Dr. Peter Dyson of La Trobe University on Fabry-Perot                          
              spectroscopy (FPS) of airglow emissions in the southern                        
              hemisphere.  Results of the FPS of airglow are used to determine               
              winds and temperatures of neutral atoms and molecules in the                   
              Earth's upper atmosphere.                                                      
                                                                                             
              Dr. Dyson currently supervises the operation of FPS airglow                    
              observatories at Beveridge, Victoria, Australia and at the                     
              Australian Antarctic station at Mawson.  Dr. Fairchild is a major              
              participant in ongoing improvements and modernization of                       
              equipment at these two observatories.  Data from the Beveridge                 
              and Mawson FPS airglow observatories provide important                         
              contributions to a worldwide program  for improved knowledge and               
              understanding of global atmospheric dynamics and change.  The                  
              current collaboration focuses on the development of a fully                    
              automated FPS airglow facility for Beveridge.  Once proven, the                
              techniques developed will also be used to automate the Mawson                  
              observatory.
