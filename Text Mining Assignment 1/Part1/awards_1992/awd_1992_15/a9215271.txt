Abstract    :
              This project addresses the weight least absolute                               
              value (WLAV) state estimator for power system                                  
              applications.  This estimator is more robust than                              
              the weighted least squared (WLS) state estimator                               
              used at present by most utilities.  The WLAV                                   
              estimator involves solving an L1 norm problem                                  
              which is usually formulated as a linear                                        
              programming (LP) problem resulting in relatively                               
              large computational times.  This work is                                       
              investigating the use of interior point methods for                            
              WLAV state estimation.  This involves three                                    
              research questions.  First, there is the question of                           
              finding a suitable interior point method.  Second,                             
              there are numerical considerations and sparsity                                
              aspects particular to this problem .  Finally, there                           
              are practical considerations such as the handling of                           
              virtual and psuedo measurements by means of                                    
              equality and constraints.  The research will be                                
              performed using a sparse matrix environment                                    
              known as the Sparse Matrix Manipulation System.
