Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The use of organisms that are naturally tolerant to limiting                   
              supplies of oxygen to probe nature's molecular and metabolic                   
              defense strategies against hypoxia is a tried and tested                       
              experimental paradigm in biology. We have found in recent studies              
              that the present day descendent of the lowlanders. In pilot                    
              position emission tomography (PET) studies of glucose metabolism               
              in heart and brain in these subjects, we found that biomedical                 
              adaptations were utilized in order to maintain each organ in energy            
              balance despite the imposed and chronic hypoxia of their home                  
              environments. The heart data demonstrated a significant dependence             
              on glucose for basal energy needs, even following an overnight                 
              fast. This provisionally has been interpreted as an adaptation,                
              serving to maximize the amount of useful energy obtainable per unit            
              amount of oxygen. Interestingly, the subjects resolved partially,              
              and in one case entirely, to the normal pattern of substrate                   
              preference after only 20 days living at sea level. Brain uptake                
              levels of glucose were at the extreme upper end of the normal range            
              and may indicate at least some non-oxygen dependent metabolism to              
              maintain energy balance. Because control and manipulation of the               
              adaptive response could be of immense practical importance, it is              
              imperative to ascertain if these defense mechanisms are general to             
              the human species. For that reason, we propose to extend our study             
              to include subjects that would be expected both genetically and                
              individually also to be hypoxia-adapted, the Sherpas of Nepal.
