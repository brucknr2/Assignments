Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is a collaborative, longitudinal study by a team of US            
              and Chinese demographers and sociologists of the patterns and                  
              determinants of health of 3,745 families and 192 Chinese                       
              communities at the individual, household, and community level.                 
              Through data collected over a number of years, researchers will be             
              able to develop a model that explains the relationship among                   
              social, economic and demographic changes, and health and                       
              nutritional outcomes.  Data and models developed during this                   
              project can be used to compare China with other low-income nations,            
              and to clarify some of the relationships between policy decisions              
              and health, both of children and of adults.  This project will be              
              conducted jointly by researchers at the University of North                    
              Carolina and the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine.
