Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award is for the purchase of computer equipment to enhance the            
              existing UNIDATA program within the Department of Atmospheric                  
              Sciences at the University of Arizona.  UNIDATA is a program to                
              empower universities, through innovative applications of current               
              computing and networking technology, to make the best use of                   
              atmospheric and related data for enhancing education and research.             
              Specifically this grant will upgrade existing workstations and                 
              central data management hardware.  In addition, four new                       
              workstations will be added to the UNIDATA system.  This upgrade                
              will provide enhanced UNIDATA capabilities to faculty and students             
              and be used for research and teaching.  This equipment will better             
              enable the principal investigator to educate graduate students in              
              the meteorological sciences and attract and retain undergrades to              
              a career in the sciences.
