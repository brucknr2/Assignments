Abstract    :
              The scaling up problem is composed of at least seven                           
              subproblems.  Some have been investigated for visual                           
              programming languages, but the others have not.  In this                       
              planning grant project, subproblems shall be identified,                       
              examined, and classified in preparation for future research.
