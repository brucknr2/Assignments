Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              We have established the feasibility of observing non-equilibrium               
              fluctuations in liquids subjected to a temperature gradient by                 
              small-angle Rayleigh scattering.  We propose to apply this                     
              technique to study non-equilibrium fluctuations in liquid mixtures,            
              macromolecular systems and colloidal suspensions.                              
                                                                                             
              Concomitant with the light-scattering work, Soret phenomena will be            
              investigated with an optional beam-bending technique.
