Abstract    :
              This proposal requests funds to support two workshops to define the            
              second Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM) campaign.  This campaign            
              will focus on the physics of the geotail and substorms.  The goals             
              of the workshops are to identify those outstanding problems in                 
              geotail and substorm physics that stand in the way of the                      
              development of a magnetospheric global circulation model and that              
              have a reasonable chance of being solved in a concerted community              
              wide research campaign lasting three to five years, and to outline             
              possible ways of addressing those problems.  The first workshop                
              will be held in Snowmass, Colorado on July 1-2, 1992.  The second              
              workshop will be held in the spring or summedr of 1993 at a yet-to-            
              be-determine location.  Funds are also requested to support the                
              production and distribution of workshop reports.
