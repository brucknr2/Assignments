Abstract    :
              With this award the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                
              Program supports research by Dr. Frederic R. Askham of the                     
              Chemistry Department, University of Delaware, on neutral and                   
              anionic transition metal eta-2-aldehyde complexes.  A new                      
              reaction sequence for synthesis of complexes of this type will                 
              be extended to transition metals other than zirconium, on which                
              the method has already proven successful, and applied to the                   
              preparation of pure chiral aldehyde complexes.  The method                     
              involves the addition of a lithiated stannane to the aldehyde                  
              followed by metathetical transmetallation.  The reactivity of                  
              the compounds synthesized will be studied, with special                        
              emphasis on the mechanism of homogeneous carbon monoxide                       
              hydrogenation catalysis, synthesis of transition metal                         
              alkylidenes, and stereospecific formation of carbon-carbon                     
              bonds.                                                                         
              %%%                                                                            
              This research has implications for improving and developing                    
              catalysts, particularly those for stereoselective synthesis.                   
              Catalysts which lead to highly pure products with minimal waste                
              are an important aspect of environmentally benign chemical                     
              synthesis and processing.
