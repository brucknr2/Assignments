Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will help the Department of Chemistry at Wesleyan University                   
              acquire a Pulsed Beam Fourier Transform Microwave Spectrometer.                
              The spectrometer will be used in the following areas of                        
              research:

              Microwave spectroscopy is a technique which measures pure                      
              rotational transitions in a moleculer that are induced by                      
              radiation in the far infrared and microwave regions of the                     
              electromagnetic spectrum.  This technique requires that the                    
              material be in the gaseous state and have a permanent dipole                   
              moment in the ground state.  Useful data, such as bond                         
              distance, bond angle and dipole moment are obtained from                       
              microwave studies.
