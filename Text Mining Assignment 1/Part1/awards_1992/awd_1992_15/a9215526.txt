Abstract    :
              The objective of the Workshop is to (1) improve communication                  
              between researchers of the U.S. and People's Republic of China,                
              (2) stimulate new thinking, and (3) to identify research topics                
              that can be conducted cooperatively. The Workshop shall consist                
              of the following parts : (1) presentation of position papers on                
              five generic areas in geotechnical engineering, (2) separate                   
              discussion sessions which will recommend research topics in each               
              area, (3) a summary session involving all participants to
