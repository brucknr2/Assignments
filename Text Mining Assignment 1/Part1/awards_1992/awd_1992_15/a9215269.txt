Abstract    :
              This travel grant from the Organic Dynamics Program will                       
              provide for partial travel expenses for US scientists to                       
              attend a special symposium on Experimental and Theoretical                     
              Aspects of Excited State Electron Transfer and Related                         
              Phenomenon to be held in Pultusk, Poland September 27-October                  
              2, 1992. This conference will bring together experts from all                  
              over the world to focus on the many and varied aspects of                      
              electron transfer in chemical systems. The symposium is a                      
              tribute to the classical work in the electron transfer field by                
              Dr. Z. R. Grabowski in Poland. Issues to be covered at the                     
              meeting include twisted charge-transfer states, photophysical                  
              processes in polymers, photoconductivity, proton tunneling,                    
              fluorescent probes, and electron transfer in heterogeneous                     
              media. These issues are crucial to a large number of important                 
              chemical processes occuring in such diverse media as polymeric                 
              materials and heterogeneous solutions.  This grant will provide                
              critical moral support for the Polish chemical community and                   
              will help solidify interactions between US and Polish                          
              scientists.

              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program to Professor P. F.                
              Barbara at the University of Minnesota will be used to support                 
              participants from the US at the Symposium on Experimental and                  
              Theoretical Aspects of Electron Transfer and Related Phenomenon                
              to be held in Pultusk, Poland from September 27-October 2,1992.                
              Plenary lectures will be presented by a number of scientists                   
              from the US, and the meeting will provide an excellent conduit                 
              for solidification of cooperation with foreign scientist in                    
              this important area of chemistry.
