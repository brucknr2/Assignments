Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Basic research studies to address issues of  both fundamental and              
              practical importance concerning primary physical processes which               
              influence the type, density and thermal stability of ion                       
              implantation induced defect accumulation in silicon will be                    
              conducted.  The approach utilizes photo-injection of electron/hole             
              pairs, coupled with either an intrinsically built-in electric                  
              potential, or a secondary externally controlled vertical or lateral            
              electric field, during implantation to modulate and control the                
              density, lifetime and complexing behavior of point defects.

              This research addresses basic aspects of silicon processing                    
              fundamentally related to advanced device and circuit fabrication.              
              The innovative research proposed offers possibilities for                      
              significant improvements in devices and integrated circuits used in            
              computing ,information processing, and telecommunications.
