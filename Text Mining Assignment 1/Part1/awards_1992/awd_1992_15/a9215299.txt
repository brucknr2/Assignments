Abstract    :
              This grant is to assist in the support of an international                     
              symposium on "Creep and Shrinkage of Concrete" to be held during               
              September 1993.  It will be held at the Technical University of                
              Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain, organized in cooperation with the                 
              Northwestern University Center for Advanced Cement-Based                       
              Materials, and held under the auspices of RILEM.  (International               
              Union of the Research Laboratories in Materials and Structures,                
              Paris).  The aim of the symposium is to appraise the state-of-                 
              the-art and set directions for new research.  It will facilitate               
              an interdisciplinary dialogue between scientists working in                    
              materials science, continuum mechanics, structural engineering                 
              and concrete technology, and will stimulate new developments and               
              areas of research in the field.  The symposium will result in an               
              authoritative high quality proceedings volume which will serve as              
              a basic reference on the subject of creep and shrinkage of                     
              concrete.
