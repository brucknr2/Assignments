Abstract    :
                   This program of research by the Byer group will directly                  
              support the LIGO project through laser development; studies of                 
              thermal effects from high power operation; frequency doubling                  
              using nonlinear crystals.  Laser stabilization, and laser                      
              reliability will also be investigated.                                         
                   The work on laser development will complete the                           
              construction and testing of a 13-W diode-laser-pumped Nd:YAG                   
              laser.  Studies of thermal effects will include both numerical                 
              modeling of these in interferometers, as well as measurements                  
              of scatter, absorption, and stress-induced birefringence in                    
              optical components.  Research on frequency doubling will                       
              investigate efficient doubling using materials such as LBO,                    
              magnesium oxide-doped lithium niobate, and periodically poled                  
              lithium niobate.
