Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Biotic interactions of sessile colonial invertebrates are often                
              mediated by inducible structures that are locally deployed on the              
              colony. In no other group of animals is there likely to be such a              
              tight relationship between the function of ecological interaction              
              and underlying physiological constraints. Colonies of                          
              the marine bryozoan, Membranipora membranacea, specifically change             
              morphology with changes in the biotic environment: spines are                  
              induced by predators, and stolons by some conspecifics. Previous               
              work has shown that the spines exact a fitness cost and this                   
              project will test the hypothesis that the mechanism underlying the             
              cost is disruption of colony-wide translocation and metabolic                  
              patterns.  Although inducible defenses are common in marine,                   
              terrestrial, and freshwater organisms, and costs have been                     
              frequently demonstrated, no studies have elucidated mechanisms                 
              underlying costs of defense.  The current hypothesis of this                   
              project is based on the concept of a simple source-sink model                  
              controlling the basic process of translocation in bryozoan colonies            
              and linking physiological function with ecological performance.                
              This project will attempt to develop radioisotope methods using                
              14Carbon and 35Sulfur to test the hypothesis.
