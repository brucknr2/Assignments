Abstract    :
              In this project in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry                 
              program of the Division of Chemistry the nature of                             
              nonadditivity of energies in a variety of systems is being                     
              explored by quantum mechanical methods.  Both the supermolecule                
              method and symmetry-adapted perturbation theory are being                      
              employed.  A wide variety of types of systems are being                        
              studied, including nonpolar systems, polar systems, and mixed                  
              polar-nonpolar systems (such as rare gas - water aggregates).                  
              Analytic potentials are being obtained which explicitly include                
              multibody effects and which are thus suitable for simulations                  
              of the behavior of both condensed phases and clusters.                         
              %%%                                                                            
              The energies of very large molecules and solids are often                      
              assumed to be approximated well by the sum of the energies of                  
              the smaller molecules, or even the atoms, making up the system.                
              In this project theoretical methods are being used to assess                   
              the accuracy of such assumptions and to develop more accurate                  
              energies of large systems.
