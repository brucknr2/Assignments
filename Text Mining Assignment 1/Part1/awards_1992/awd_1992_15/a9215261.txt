Abstract    :
                   The work will advance the processing science and                          
              technology of thermoplastic composites through fundamental studies             
              of the on-line consolidation of thermoplastic composites using                 
              lasers.  The laser-based system provides localized melting and                 
              resolidification and produces void-free parts.  It offers the                  
              opportunity to control the fiber placement and microstructure with             
              high precision, leading to fabrication of thermoplastic parts that             
              have superior structural integrity.                                            
                   This process reduces the number of processing steps, leading              
              to increased production rates and reduction of residual stress:                
              both major concerns in economical fabrication of high-performance              
              composite parts.  The results of the research will lead to                     
              increased consolidation speeds, use of wider prepreg tows, and                 
              fabrication of large scale, non-cylindrical components using                   
              varying consolidation speeds.  The process may ultimately allow the            
              low cost fabrication of high performance composite parts.
