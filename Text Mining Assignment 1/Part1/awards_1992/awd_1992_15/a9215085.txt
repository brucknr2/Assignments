Abstract    :
                9215085  Marcus      This is the third year of a three-year award to
              investigate  techniques of high potential for making the search process easier 
              and more effective for inexperienced as well as expert searchers.   An
              experimental search assistance method is enhanced for greater  effectiveness
              by: 1) replacing the textually oriented user  interface with a graphically
              oriented user interface (GUI), and 2)  extending the underlying search models
              to serve as a basis for  assistance for searching in general databases with a
              verbal  indexing character as well as in bibliographic databases.  The 
              enhanced system is tested on a variety of experimental users to  determine how
              well the GUI aids the user by encapsulating the  conceptual representation of
              the user's problem and guide in the  generation, execution, evaluation, and
              modification of the  multiplex search strategies needed to facilitate efficient
              and  effective searching.  The tests compare results from bibliographic  and
              full text, and other non-bibliographic databases, as well as  for different
              modalities of user interfaces, ranging from highly  user-directed interactions
              to highly automated or system-directed  modes, where user initiatives may be
              limited to an initial problem  statement and a minimal amount of relevance
              feedback on retrieved  documents.
