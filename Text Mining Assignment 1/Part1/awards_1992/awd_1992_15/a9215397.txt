Abstract    :
              This proposal presents a comprehensive study of rock anisotropy                
              and the nature of the stress field induced in anisotropic rock                 
              masses with irregular topographies consisting of ridges and                    
              valleys. The first task of the proposed research is analytical                 
              and consists of deriving closed-form solutions to investigate the              
              combining effect of rock stratification and topography on in situ              
              stresses. The second task consists of testing a variety of                     
              anisotropic rocks under uniaxial, triaxial and true triaxial                   
              conditions to determine their range of elastic properties. The                 
              third task is to conduct dilatometer tests to determine the                    
              deformability properties of anisotropic rock masses in the field.
