Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project involves the dissertation research of a cultural                  
              anthropologist from the University of New Mexico.  The student                 
              will study how Costa Rican peasants defend their agricultural                  
              practices from environmentalist criticism, at the same time that               
              the peasants try to insure the continued viability of their                    
              farming occupations.  Using a mixed methodology of participant                 
              observation and intensive interviews of a small sample of peasant              
              households, some more and some less "environmentalist", the study              
              will show how rural farmers use information and rhetoric "from                 
              above" to defend their lifestyles.                                             
                                                                                             
              This project is important because environmental concerns must be               
              adopted by rural as well as urban households if conservation                   
              policies are to be successful.  This sort of in-depth case study               
              will provide valuable information on how rural peoples understand              
              and react to environmentalist arguments, which can help designers              
              of conservation policies improve their programs.
