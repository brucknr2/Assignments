Abstract    :
              This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                  
              chemistry and in the subfield of separation science.  During the               
              tenure of this three-year continuing grant, Professor Davis and                
              his students will carry out theoretical and experimental studies               
              to ascertain the statistical limitations of two-dimensional                    
              chromatography.  The primary question being addressed by this                  
              research is the amount of information necessary to specify the                 
              chemical identities of analyte components in both one-dimensional              
              and two-dimensional thin layer chromatography.                                 
              %%%                                                                            
              The successful attainment of the goals of this project is expected             
              to impact broadly in the area of multi-dimensional analysis.                   
              Additionally, useful insights into problems in capillary zone                  
              electrophoresis, micellar electrokinetic chromatography, and field             
              flow fractionation are expected to accrue from this research.
