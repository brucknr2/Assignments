Abstract    :
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                      
              continuing work of Professor Richard H. Smith at Western Maryland              
              College. Various cyclization reactions of haloalkyl triazenes to               
              hitherto unknown classes of triazenes will be studied. The                     
              mechanism and the role of the metal ion will be investigated for               
              the formation of linear chloropropyl triazenes, and of the new                 
              cyclization products, azimines and triazinines, that result from               
              the reaction between 3-chloropropyl azide and Grignard reagents.               
              The chemistry of these new non-aromatic azimines and the hydrolytic            
              decomposition of triazinines will be explored. The ultimate goal is            
              to develop a comprehensive understanding of the relationship                   
              between the chemistry of linear triazenes, cyclic triazenes, and               
              non-aromatic azimines.                                                         
              %%%                                                                            
              Cyclic triazenes and non-aromatic azimines are new classes of                  
              compounds of which the chemistry and hydrolytic decomposition will             
              be studied by Professor Smith and his undergraduate students. The              
              compounds are of interest for physical organic studies to delineate            
              the mechanism of metabolism and triazene degradation in cellular               
              systems.
