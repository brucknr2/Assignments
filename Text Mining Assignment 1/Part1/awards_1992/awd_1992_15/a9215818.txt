Abstract    :
              Energy generation and transport in sub-micrometer electronic                   
              devices do not obey continuum laws such Ohm's law and                          
              Fourier's law. It is proposed to study such processes both                     
              theoretically and experimentally. The theoretical model                        
              considers the electrons, optical phonons and acoustic phonons                  
              to be three thermodynamic systems which exchange energy                        
              between themselves.  The constitutive relations for heat and                   
              particle fluxes are obtained from the Boltzmann transport                      
              equation. With appropriate conservation laws the model will                    
              predict the temperatures of electrons, optical phonons and                     
              acoustic phonons, as well as density of charge carriers and                    
              electrical conductivity. The experimental effort will focus on                 
              developing a new technique of nanometer-scale temperature                      
              measurement, making use of the atomic force microscope. The                    
              measured temperatures will be compared with theoretical                        
              predictions.
