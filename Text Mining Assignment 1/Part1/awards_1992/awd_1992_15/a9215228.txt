Abstract    :
              In this project of the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and                            
              Organometalic Chemistry Program, Michael T. Pope of Georgetown                 
              University will investigate the chemistry of polyoxometalate                   
              species.  This research is directed towards developing and                     
              controlling the reactivity of metal oxygen cluster anions in                   
              polar and nonpolar solvents.  Such polyanions are viewed as                    
              models of metal oxides and offer possibilities for deeper                      
              understanding of the heterogeneous catalytic activity of                       
              oxides.  Surfaces of large polyoxotungstate(VI) and                            
              molybdate(VI) anions containing 12 - 40 metal atoms will be                    
              activated by the introduction of lower-valent metal cations and                
              by reduction in certain cases to yield metal-metal bonded                      
              cluster domains.  These species will be investigated with                      
              regard to their atom- and electron-transfer reactivities.

              Potentially catalytic compounds containing metal ions and                      
              oxygen atoms will be developed.  These compounds are of                        
              interest because they are wholly inorganic, and thus should be                 
              quite robust under catalytic conditions.  Moreover, because of                 
              their large size and variable composition, these compounds                     
              provide a wealth of fascinating information about how metal                    
              ions "communicate" in close proximity.
