Abstract    :
                   Isotopic and elemental composition of groundwater are                     
              influenced by climatic conditions at the time of recharge and are              
              therefore potential indicators for climate change.  To date                    
              little work has been done to unravel climate information                       
              contained in deep circulating groundwater.  However, it has been               
              successfully demonstrated that in selected aquifers the isotopic               
              composition of groundwater and the concentrations of dissolved                 
              noble gases can be related to paleotemperatures and/or past                    
              atmospheric circulation patterns.  These studies raised hopes                  
              that groundwater as an archive of paleoclimate may play an                     
              important role in future climate research, but they also indicate              
              that there are still many open questions that must be addressed.               
              This award supports a meeting at Lamont-Doherty Geological                     
              Observatory of Columbia University to explore the potential and                
              strategies for future paleoclimate research in this area.
