Abstract    :
                   The aim of the project is the manufacture of net shapes of                
              high performance composites at high rates via high production rate             
              plasma spray technology.  If such shapes can be quickly produced               
              from a variety of materials, product design and even manufacture               
              can be greatly expedited.  The spray forming of net shapes is                  
              currently limited by a lack of understanding of the materials                  
              science and process science bases of the technology.  The  project             
              will address the key issues related to this technology in order to             
              optimize water-stabilized plasma (WSP) and electromagnetically                 
              coalesced plasma (EMCP) processing.  An interdisciplinary program              
              will be developed for process diagnostics/modelling and                        
              microstructural and mechanical characterization of the deposit.                
              Industrial collaborators are an integral part of the research team             
              that has been formed to address plasma-based manufacture of net                
              shapes.                                                                        
                   The high powered water-stabilized DC plasma torch and                     
              electromagnetically coalesced torch may enable production of free-             
              standing structural forms, comprised of ceramics, metal alloys and             
              composite materials.  WSP spray processing of materials can be                 
              carried out at considerably higher temperatures than is possible               
              for gas-stabilized plasmas (viz. 30,000K versus 15,000K).  The EMCP            
              route enables the spray-forming of ceramics or composites from feed            
              materials that are in the liquid or slurry forms.  These processes             
              permit the use of both larger particulate-sized feedstock powders              
              and an increase in spray processing through-put by at least an                 
              order of magnitude; i.e., from 5 to 50 kg of alumina (for                      
              example) per hour.
