Abstract    :
                  9215694  Zamrik  A series of multiaxial thermal-mechanical fatigue (TMF)
              tests are  to be conducted using two structural materials: type 316 stainless 
              steel and Nickel-base superalloy Waspaloy.  The TMF tests will be  conducted in
              continuous cycling modes and with holds-in-  strain/temperature imposed on the
              continuous cycling waveforms.   The hold-periods are imposed in the TMF loading
              cycles to induce  time dependent effects such as creep and oxidation.  The
              objective  of this research is to characterize the mechanical and 
              micromechanical TMF responses of these two materials under  multiaxial
              isothermal fatigue and creep-fatigue responses of these  two structural
              materials from available data.  Extensive  microstructural evaluations of the
              fracture and failure processes  of these two materials will be conducted in
              order to develop a  physical-based universal life prediction concept.  A
              universal  multiaxial fatigue life prediction concept developed for the 
              isothermal case will be applied to the multiaxial TMF data obtained  in this
              research study.  ***
