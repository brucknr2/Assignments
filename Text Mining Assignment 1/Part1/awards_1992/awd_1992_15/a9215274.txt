Abstract    :
              9215274  Gandhi  The proposed research would adapt and expand on efficient 
              computational techniques (both time domain and impedance  methods), previously
              used to help understand radio-frequency  EM field effects on humans, to the
              study of power-frequency  EMF's.  Field distributions and current densities
              will be  estimated, using detailed high resolution, anisotropic, 
              anatomically-based models based on MRI scans, for a range of  conditions of
              practical interest.  The accuracy of the  numerical methods will be verified
              experimentally using a  reduced scale models of the human.    This research is
              important because it deals with an issue  that is of current public concern. 
              The information gained  from this study could help determine appropriate 
              experimental conditions to use in biological studies on the  effects of
              power-line fields on humans and to help determine  realistic safety guidelines.
