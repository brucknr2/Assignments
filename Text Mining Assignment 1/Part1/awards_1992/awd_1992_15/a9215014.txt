Abstract    :
                   This award supports research in theoretical nuclear                       
              structure physics.  Shape coexistence and shape transitions                    
              will be studied in the mass A=80 and A=100 regions by applying                 
              the Interacting Boson Model with allowance for the neutron-                    
              proton interaction.  Comparisons will be made to microscopic                   
              mean-field calculations.
