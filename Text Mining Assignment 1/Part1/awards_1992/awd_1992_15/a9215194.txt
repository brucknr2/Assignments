Abstract    :
              The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program of the                     
              Chemistry Division is supporting research by Dr. Klippenstein                  
              for an investigation of unimolecular reaction rate theory.  A                  
              variational statistical approach is used for dissociation                      
              reactions in which there is no barrier to the reverse                          
              recombination process.  Comparison of theory with experiment is                
              based on use of potential energy surfaces computed ab initio.

              Understanding of the rates at which chemical reactions occurs                  
              has lagged far behind understanding of reaction energetics.                    
              Modern computational methods and new theoretical advances are                  
              now making it possible to make progress on this long-standing                  
              problem.  This award is for a frontier effort in that direction.
