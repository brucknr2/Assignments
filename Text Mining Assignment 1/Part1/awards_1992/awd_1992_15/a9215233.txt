Abstract    :
                   This research continues the study of generic stochastic                   
              manufacturing systems.  It includes the development of further                 
              results on simple almost optimal heuristics for parallel machine               
              scheduling.  It also examines a wide range of flow line problems,              
              including probabilistic analysis of deterministic scheduling rules,            
              new models for tandem lines with dependent service times, and some             
              new performance measures aimed at reduced Work-In-Process and Just-            
              In-Time manufacturing.  New approaches to control of queueing                  
              networks and jobshops, such as Bandit problems and                             
              Brownian networks that may yield robust, simple, priority                      
              scheduling rules will be explored.  Some recently started work in              
              scheduling of a metal rolling mill, will provide a practical                   
              testbed for the combined  application of stochastic and                        
              deterministic models.  Here the stochastic models provide long term            
              optimal throughput, while short term deterministic algorithms                  
              minimize setup and changeover costs.  This is a realistic approach             
              for the increasing uncertainty as the time horizon lengthens.                  
                   Technology transfer will be achieved through the                          
              implementation of case studies and development of constructional               
              manuals and tutorials for curriculum in manufacturing systems.
