Abstract    :
                   This supplement augments the research program at the                      
              University of California, Berkeley's Industry/University                       
              Cooperative Research Center for Sensors and Actuators by cost-                 
              sharing a joint collaborative "TIE" project to be performed with               
              Northwestern University's Industry/University Cooperative Research             
              Center for Tribology.                                                          
                   The "TIE" project is a joint synergistic effort to study and              
              model the friction occurring with extremely small devices and                  
              loads.  The Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for                
              Sensors and Actuators is studying friction in very small devices               
              under extremely small loads.  The Industry/University Cooperative              
              Research Center for Tribology is developing relevant solid                     
              mechanisms models that satisfy its collaboration's observations.               
                   The Program Manager recommends the University of California,              
              Berkeley be awarded $50,000 for a two-year "TIE" project to be                 
              performed collaboratively with Northwestern University.
