Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                   This  is  an award under the Grants for Improving  Doctoral              
              Disseration  Research  program.  It is a  study  of  the  various              
              discourses about slavery that circulated in the North during  the              
              period  1831-1861.  It will be carried out through work in  local              
              historical archives, where data will be collected on a variety of              
              groups  involved in the debates about slavery and  the  sorts  of              
              discourses  they  used.  Results will be  analyzed  in  terms  of              
              theories  and  debates  about the role of cultural  discourse  in              
              social movement mobilizations.                                                 
                                                                                             
                    This research will contribute to a growing trend to utilize              
              systematic analysis of the impact of ideas and cultural themes on              
              the emergence of social movements.  It will also contribute to an              
              enhanced  awareness of the political dynamics in northern  states              
              which shaped the period leading up to the Civil War.  In addition              
              to  the  scientific  gains to be achieved by the  research,  this              
              award  will  materially  assist a  highly  promising  student  in              
              completing  research  for  the  Ph.D.  dissertation.    Thus   it              
              contributes to the future scientific manpower of the  nation  and              
              the thorough training of the next generation of sociologists.
