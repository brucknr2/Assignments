Abstract    :
                   A key ingredient in technological innovation is the capability            
              of the available workforce.  The systems for educating and then                
              professionally developing technical personnel vary among leading               
              industrialized countries.                                                      
                   A systematic examination of these similarities and differences            
              can lead to a better understanding of how to make this vital                   
              process more effective.  Also the U.S. engineering community is                
              currently experimenting with differing curricular approaches.                  
                   This conference will bring together the experience from many              
              parts of the world and it is an ideal mechanism for a systematic               
              and timely examination of the education and professional                       
              development process in the U.S.                                                
                   The result of the conference is expected to be a better                   
              understanding of other approaches to this problem and this                     
              information will be able to be used to strengthen the U.S. system.
