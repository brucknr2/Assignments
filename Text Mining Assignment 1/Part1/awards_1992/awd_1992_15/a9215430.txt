Abstract    :
                   The goal of this research is to develop and compare different             
              methods of designing manufacturing systems.  Manufacturing system              
              design can be regarded as the mapping of performance requirements,             
              specified with the help of numerical performance measures, onto                
              numerical decision variables which specify a capable design                    
              solution.                                                                      
                   The methods investigated in this research are novel in two                
              respects.  First, they are targeted at a wide variety of                       
              manufacturing system types (flow lines, job shops, cellular system,            
              etc.).  Second, they can accommodate manufacturing system design               
              problems in which the performance requirements involve multiple                
              types of performance measures (e.g., production rate and average               
              work in process), and in which design solutions involve multiple               
              types of decision variables (e.g., machine quantities and machine              
              layout and buffer capacities).//
