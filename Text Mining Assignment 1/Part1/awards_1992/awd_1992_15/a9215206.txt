Abstract    :
              Computers will be purchased which will be used in on-line                      
              eventanalysis of data from the MEGA experiment at LAMPF.                       
              Searches will be conducted for events which are forbidden in the               
              Standard Model of elementary particles, namely, the decay of                   
              amuon into an electron and a gamma ray.  Precision measurement of              
              the shape of the normal positron-neutrino-antineutrino decay mode              
              of muons will provide a test of the currently accepted V-A theory              
              of weak interactions.  Both these experiment thus search for new               
              physics. The computers which will be purchased are very important              
              to the success of this experiment.
