Abstract    :
              This support will allow the New York Botanical Garden to publish               
              a 1500-page, two-volume monograph, The Moss Flora of Mexico, the               
              research for which was NSF-funded.  This study which contains                  
              contributions from 32 authors, is one of the few moss floras for               
              any tropical country and documents 900 species in 32 genera.  Its              
              comprehensiveness and scholarship, including the more than 800                 
              plates that illustrate many of the species for the first time,                 
              will make the volumes an invaluable resource for professionals                 
              and students working in tropical biodiversity, tropical floras,                
              and especially bryology.
