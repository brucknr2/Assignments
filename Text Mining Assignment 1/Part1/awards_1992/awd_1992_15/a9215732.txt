Abstract    :
                   This research is intended to design and develop a high speed              
              vision system for precision inspection.  It will consist of three              
              hierarchial levels.  The first level will consist of an Application            
              Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) for performing the pattern                  
              matching operation.  The second level of hierarchy will consist of             
              interface structures for efficient and concurrent data processing              
              and interface communications.  The third level of the system will              
              be designed and implemented to perform the extension computation               
              of pattern processing which is done on a pixel by pixel basis.                 
              For this critical leve a special parallel processing architecture              
              will be researched.  A proof of concept prototype will be                      
              fabricated to verify the system.                                               
                   High speed precision vision inspection has a very wide variety            
              of uses in the manufacturing industry.  They range from inspection             
              of labels in the food packaging industry to size information on                
              diesel injectors.  The successful development of this system should            
              impact the productivity of a range of manufacturing enterprises.
