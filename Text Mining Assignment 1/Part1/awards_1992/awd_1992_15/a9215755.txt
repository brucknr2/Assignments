Abstract    :
                   This research focuses on issues involved in the development               
              of a generic architecture for intelligent networked colocation in              
              concurrent engineering.  Constraints networks have been identified             
              by the principal investigators as an elegant and powerful technique            
              that can be used as basis for concurrent engineering.  In previous             
              work, the basic constraint specification language and constraint               
              processing algorithms were determined, implemented, and tested.                
              The utility of this approach has been demonstrated via applications            
              to numerous domains.  Currently, this scope is being widened with              
              particular emphasis on early system decision making as well as                 
              detailed design for electronics packaging.                                     
                   By investigating application to this subject area in depth,               
              it is expected that generic techniques will be determined that will            
              apply both here and to other areas of engineering design.  As part             
              of this effort, research is being conducted in constraint-based                
              language issues such as optimization, alternative modes of                     
              abstraction of knowledge, seamless interfaces to point design                  
              tools, learning, and uncertainty.
