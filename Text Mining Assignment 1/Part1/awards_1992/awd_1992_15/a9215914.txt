Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Three related investigations are to be conducted in the area                   
              of environmental fluid mechanics, in particular density                        
              stratified turbulent flow. The approach is essentially                         
              experimental. The three topics are: mixing between turbulent                   
              layers of different properties separated by a laminar region,                  
              the horizontal outflow generated near the ground by heavy                      
              descending air masses, and mixing and internal wave generation                 
              in a variable properties stably stratified turbulent shear                     
              flow.                                                                          
                                                                                             
              The research is relevant to oceanic mixing, pollutant                          
              transport in the atmosphere, and wind shear due to                             
              microbursts.
