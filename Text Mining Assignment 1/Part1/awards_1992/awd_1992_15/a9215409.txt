Abstract    :
              The main objective of this research is to explore the feasibility              
              of coupling the Spectral-Analysis-of-Surface-Waves (SASW) method               
              for the detection and delineation of underground cavities with                 
              the concept of geotomography, so that a three-dimensional mapping              
              of subsurface features can be accomplished. The presence of                    
              subsurface voids and objects can cause serious challenges for                  
              structural, geotechnical, and environmental engineers, and can                 
              jeopardize public safety. Therefore, methods are needed to locate              
              such features as part of the site investigation program in                     
              suspect areas. SASW method with the proposed enhancement will                  
              provide such a means.
