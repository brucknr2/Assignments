              this subject was held last year at                                             
              the beginning of major funding of                                              
              this program by DARPA and DOC.  The                                            
              support requested from NSF would be                                            
              used to enable students and postdocs                                           
              field working in this field who have                                           
              submitted contributed papers to                                                
              attend the meeting and present their                                           
              work.  This is an important emerging                                           
              technology, and the requested use of                                           
              NSF funds for student and postdoc                                              
              support will be very effective in                                              
              enhancing the base of trained
