Abstract    :
                   The purpose of this research is to perform additional work for            
              the development and conceptual evolution of Modelworld - a national            
              research facility for Intelligent Manufacturing.  Modelworld is an             
              evolving center at Texas A&M University whose major purpose is to              
              fill the research voids identified in the Committee On the Next                
              Decade in Operations Research study.                                           
                   The principle intent of Modelworld is to provide a                        
              manufacturing applications studio to researchers.  Modelworld will             
              consist of a modern flexible manufacturing system accessible to                
              manufacturing researchers throughout the country via an electronic             
              communications link Internet. The link will connect Modelworld to              
              other researchers so that  research information can be shared among            
              geographically separated researchers.
