Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Observations in the eastern tropical Pacific indicate that a new El            
              Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event is now underway.  ENSO                  
              events that produce stormy winters in Southern California can                  
              decimate adult kelp populations through physical disturbance, and              
              even relatively mild ENSO events can produce extreme nutrient                  
              limitation that reduce the abundance and productivity of giant                 
              kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera.  The effects of ENSO on abundances and             
              productivity of the giant kelp are well documented, but its effect             
              on genetic diversity and population dynamics of giant kelp                     
              remains unknown.  This project will initiate a most timely                     
              investigation of the impact of the 1992 ENSO event on genetic                  
              diversity of giant kelp populations in the Southern California                 
              Bight.  The approach will exploit DNA fingerprinting and                       
              restriction fragment length polymorphism technologies to address               
              the genetic structure and composition of giant kelp populations                
              prior to the ENSO event and during the post-ENSO recovery.  To                 
              evaluate the critical post-ENSO recovery period, this research                 
              (having extreme urgency) must be initiated now before the onset of             
              the 1992 ENSO event that's predicted for this summer.
