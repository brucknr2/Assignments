Abstract    :
              The Construction Decision Support System for Delay Analysis (DAS               
              - Delay Analysis System) for use on personal computers was                     
              developed to integrate existing project control systems and                    
              scheduling programs by adding the capability of determining                    
              possible causes for delays and suggesting alternative courses of               
              action to prevent further delays. The DAS was designed to                      
              demonstrate the importance of providing an interactive                         
              environment for knowledge acquisition to improve project controls              
              and analysis processes.  The development of the interactive                    
              system enhances information processing and decision-making                     
              capabilities.  The ability to monitor the progress of a project,               
              and to determine possible causes of delays and suggest corrective              
              actions with the aid of a personal computer provides consistent                
              evaluation of project performance.                                             
                                                                                             
              The objective of the second phase of the DAS research is to                    
              include additional knowledge bases related to contract and                     
              project parameters such as different types of projects, different              
              locations of projects, and different types of firms to increase                
              its usefulness to the diverse segments of the construction                     
              industry.  The data collected will be analyzed using hypothesis                
              testing to determine whether there are correlations between the                
              different parameters and types of delays.  The results of this                 
              analysis will be used to refine the DA system submodels.                       
              Additional research objectives include conducting research in the              
              area of international delays, including cultural factors, and                  
              creating new submodels that will contain knowledge on delays                   
              related to international construction.  Research will also be                  
              conducted into resolution upon completion of construction                      
              projects.
