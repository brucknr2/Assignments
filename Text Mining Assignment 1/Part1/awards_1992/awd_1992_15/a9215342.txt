Abstract    :
              Joyce  9215342    An observational  program of moored acoustic  Doppler current 
              profilers and current meters will be conducted under the RIDGE  program to
              examine the spatial and temporal variability of a  buoyant hydrothermal plume
              on the Cleft segment of the Juan de Fuca  Ridge. The objectives are to
              determine if the observed features of  velocity and vorticity fields are
              consistent with the theory that  suggest that hydrothermal venting can generate
              unsteady mesoscale  vortices and whether they are correlated with anomalous
              temperature  and particulate signatures associated with the venting.
