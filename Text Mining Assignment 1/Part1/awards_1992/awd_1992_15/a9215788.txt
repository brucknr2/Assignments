Abstract    :
              The wear behavior of strongly ordered intermetallic compounds                  
              which have been modified by introduction of a ductile phase will               
              be studied.  The effects of volume fraction, size and spacing of               
              the ductile phase on the deformation mechanisms and wear                       
              resistance of Ni-Al-Fe and Ni-Si systems will be studied.  Wear                
              behavior will be compared with fracture toughness data obtained                
              at several different rates of loading and evaluated in terms of                
              deformation mechanisms.  The effects of environment will be                    
              evaluated also to assess the extent of oxidative wear.
