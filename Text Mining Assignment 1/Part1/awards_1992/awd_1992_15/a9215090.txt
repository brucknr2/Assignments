Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This research is aimed at understanding the mechanisms of                 
              ocean-atmosphere interaction in the tropics and the phenomena that             
              these produce.  The methods and models already developed will be               
              applied to three main areas:                                                   
                                                                                             
              1)   Contined work on interannual variability, emphasizing                     
                   analytical as well as numerical approaches.                               
                                                                                             
              2)   Initiation of work on the effects of coupled feedbacks in the             
                   climatology.  Tropical climate features in coupled general                
                   circulation models (GCMs) appear to be quite sensitive to                 
                   coupled feedbacks involving three-dimensional dynamical                   
                   interactions.  Much of the current discussion of ocean-                   
                   atmosphere interaction in tropical climate centers on a one-              
                   dimensional, vertical column point of view.  A complementary              
                   approach is proposed, aimed at developing understanding of the            
                   interactions which are nonlocal in the horizontal.                        
                                                                                             
              3)   Tropcial atmosphere modeling.  Current simple atmospheric                 
                   models used in coupling have a number of deficiencies for this            
                   type of study.  Further development of a model of complexity              
                   intermediate between these and atmospheric GCMs is proposed;              
                   in particular one for which near-analytic versions can be                 
                   obtained in simplifying cases, thanks to the properties of the            
                   Betts (1986) convection scheme.  The mechanisms driving both              
                   the tropical atmospheric response to surface boundary                     
                   conditions and intraseasonal variability, such as the Madden-             
                   Julian oscillation, will be examined.                                     
                                                                                             
                   This research is important because it is one of the studies               
              which will help determine the feasibility of modeling the coupled              
              ocean-atmosphere system for the purpose of predicting its                      
              variations on time scales of months to years, an issue of concern              
              in climate variability.
