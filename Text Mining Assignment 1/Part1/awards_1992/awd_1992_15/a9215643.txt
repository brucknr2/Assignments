Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports one trip per year, over a two year period,                 
              to Australia by Dr. Peeples of the Rush-Presbyterian -                         
              St. Luke's Medical Center in Chicago to conduct collaborative                  
              research with Dr. Jeffrey Gorman, Head for Protein Chemistry at                
              the Biomolecular Research Institute, Parkville, Victoria.                      
              Drs. Peeples and Gorman share an interest in understanding the                 
              structure and function of the paramyxovirus fusion protein. This               
              glycoprotein, in its active, cleaved form, enables the membrane                
              in which it resides to fuse with an opposing membrane. The                     
              structural elements of this protein required for its proper                    
              folding, disulfide bond formation, oligomerization, transport                  
              and cleavage are not known. Recent genetic, immunologic and                    
              peptide chemistry information generated in the laboratories of                 
              these investigators has led to new insights.                                   
                                                                                             
              The investigators will work in each other's laboratories for one               
              month each year over the duration of the award. In this way, they              
              will be able to share their diverse expertise, techniques                      
              and reagents. Both investigators are using the Newcastle disease               
              virus F protein as a model and each has developed unique antibody              
              probes which will facilitate their studies. Their first target                 
              will be to identify the disulfide bond which links the F1 and F2               
              peptides generated by cleavage in the trans Golgi and to                       
              determine its role in folding, transport and cleavage.
