Abstract    :
              This award supports Professor Donald Andrews of Yale University to             
              collaborate in economics research with Professor Werner Ploberger of           
              the Institute of Econometrics and Operations Research of the                   
              Technical University of Vienna, Austria.  These investigators began            
              joint studies in the econometrics of structural change during a 1991           
              visit to Yale University by Dr. Ploberger.  They produced two papers           
              establishing new optimal tests for situations with an unknown                  
              changepoint and for testing problems when a nuisance parameter                 
              appears only under the alternative.  Now that Dr. Ploberger has                
              returned to Vienna, they propose to continue their collaborative               
              research focusing on several related topics.  These include: 1)                
              further analysis of the properties of the optimal tests; 2)                    
              treatment of tests of multiple structural changes; 3) estimation of            
              breakpoints; and 4) inadmissibility of likelihood ratio tests in               
              this context.  This joint effort links one of the leading young                
              econometricians of the U.S. with a highly regarded European                    
              colleague to pursue state of the art research in theoretical and               
              applied economics.                                                             
                                                                                             
              This collaborative research is likely to advance both econometric              
              theory and practice.  Among the methods which will be developed are            
              some especially useful for applied economics research when the basic           
              relationships being analyzed change dramatically.  One such area is            
              the important research being done on the economic implications of              
              global climate change.
