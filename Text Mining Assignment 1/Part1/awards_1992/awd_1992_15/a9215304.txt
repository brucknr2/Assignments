Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Increasing attention is being focussed on the origin and                       
              structure of the Universe.  In these studies, analysis of the                  
              properties of groups and clusters of galaxies are essential to                 
              studies of large-scale structure.  Research supported under this               
              grant will be devoted to a study of the structure of groups and                
              clusters of galaxies.  Existing databases will be updated.  There              
              will also be studies on the cosmological distance scale.                       
                                                                                             
              The Principal Investigator is regarded as an expert in these                   
              areas of study.
