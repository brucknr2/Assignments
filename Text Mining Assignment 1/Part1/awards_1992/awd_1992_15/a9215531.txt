Abstract    :
              The Antarctic Muon And Neutrino Detector Array (AMANDA) project                
              will imbed sensitive photomultiplier tubes about one kilometer deep            
              in the Antarctic ice sheet at South Pole to use the ice itself as              
              a Cherenkov detector for high energy neutrinos of astrophysical                
              origin which have passed through the Earth.  Additionally, AMANDA              
              will be sensitive to neutrinos which are produced in the atmosphere            
              near the north pole and can be used to make measurements of                    
              neutrino properties.                                                           
                                                                                             
              Neutrino astronomy has, to date, been limited to detection of solar            
              neutrinos and one brief burst from a supernova which appeared in               
              the Large Magellanic Cloud in February 1987.  Very recently several            
              new sources of high energy gamma rays, which may also be neutrino              
              sources, have been discovered by the Compton Observatory satellite             
              and, most significantly, the atmospheric Cherenkov telescope on Mt.            
              Hopkins, AZ.  There should also be many detectable neutrino sources            
              which are not detectable by gamma rays, or any other wavelength of             
              electromagnetic radiation, because of intervening matter.                      
                                                                                             
              Only just now is it becoming technically feasible to build neutrino            
              telescopes and as one of the first generation of such instruments,             
              AMANDA promises to be a large contributor to a new branch of                   
              observational astronomy.
