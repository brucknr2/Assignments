Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The USA-CIS Seminars on Ferroelectrics have                                    
              developed into an effective scientific exchange                                
              between American and former Soviet theoretical                                 
              and experimental scientists studying                                           
              ferroelectricity and related phenomena.  There                                 
              are some 500 to 1,000 scientists in the former                                 
              Soviet Union working in this area.  The Second                                 
              Seminar, to be held June 22-26, 1992 in St.                                    
              Petersburg, Russia, will be devoted to the                                     
              physics of ferroelectrics and related materials                                
              and will focus on the optics and spectroscopy of                               
              ferroelectrics.  Emphasis will also be given to                                
              the structure and properties of new classes of                                 
              ferroelectrics, including connections with high                                
              temperature superconducting oxides.  The U.S.                                  
              Committee of the Second Seminar will be chaired                                
              by Dr. George W. Taylor of Princeton Resources

              This project fulfills the program objective of                                 
              advancing scientific knowledge by enabling                                     
              leading researchers in the United States and the                               
              U.S.S.R. to combine complementary efforts and                                  
              capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest                                
              and competence in the field of basic scientific                                
              research on the basis of equality, reciprocity,                                
              and mutuality of benefit.
