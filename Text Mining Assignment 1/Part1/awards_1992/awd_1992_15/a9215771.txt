Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A series of studies is proposed jointly between the University of              
              Georgia and the Guangdong Rice Research Institute on determining               
              how photosynthesis has been increased in a new hybrid rice                     
              developed in China.  On-going experiments in China indicate that               
              the utilization of photosynthetic heterosis in a hybrid rice,                  
              from a US high-light adapted ecotype crossed with a South China                
              low-light adapted ecotype, is a promising approach to increasing               
              photosynthesis, broadening environmental adaptability, and                     
              increasing productivity. In this project, coordinated studies                  
              will be conducted to compare a hybrid rice (Le/Qi) and its                     
              parents to determine how photosynthesis has been modified.                     
              Portions of the work will be conducted at three sites -- Georgia,              
              Arkansas, and China.
