Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This analytical 200kV transmission electron microscope with field              
              emission gun is a state of the art high brightness source to be                
              used in highly relevant fundamental materials research programs.               
              Faculty members in four different colleges at Ohio State                       
              University, and researchers throughout the state of Ohio will have             
              access to this new instrument.   It will provide a field emission              
              gun, energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, electron energy loss                
              spectroscopy in parallel, and a high resolution video camera for               
              recording high resolution electron microscopy images.  On-line                 
              image analysis and simulation will also be possible.
