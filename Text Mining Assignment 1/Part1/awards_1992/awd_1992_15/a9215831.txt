Abstract    :
                   This project will support a Conference on Graduate Programs in            
              the Applied Mathematical Sciences to be held April 16-17, 1993 at              
              Clemson University.  Major objectives of the conference are to                 
              project characteristics of successful graduate programs for the                
              1990's and beyond, to identify those characteristics of current                
              programs that are essential for success, and to clarify nonacademic            
              employment opportunities.  Both masters and doctoral programs will             
              be addressed.  Specific conference objectives are:  (1) to review              
              the current state of graduate education in the applied mathematical            
              sciences; (2) to obtain perspectives on current                                
              industrial/government employment opportunities and placement; (3)              
              to clarify methods to attract undergraduates to graduate study in              
              the mathematical sciences; and (4) to publicize graduate applied               
              mathematical science programs to the university community and                  
              potential students.  Major themes of the conference will be recent             
              developments within the mathematical sciences, their utility as                
              essential ingredients for the solution of modern technological                 
              problems, and the challenges and opportunities these developments              
              present to graduate education in the future.                                   
                   Individuals from universities, industry, and government                   
              laboratories, who possess a broad perspective, will be invited                 
              participants.  Representatives from the professional societies,                
              including the American Mathematical Society, the American                      
              Statistical Association, the Operations Research Society of                    
              America, and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics                
              will also be invited.  A forum will be provided within which                   
              leaders in the field can assess and make recommendations for future            
              graduate programs.  A conference proceedings will be published.
