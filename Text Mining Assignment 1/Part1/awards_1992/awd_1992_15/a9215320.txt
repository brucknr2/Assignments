Abstract    :
              This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                  
              chemistry and in the subfield of separation science.  During the               
              tenure of this forty-month continuing grant, Professor Jorgenson               
              and his students will carry out research in capillary zone                     
              electrophoresis (CZE) with specific thrusts in three areas.                    
              First, two-dimensional separations protocols involving hybrid                  
              liquid chromatography - cze techniques will be explored; second,               
              new post-column reaction/fluorescence detection protocols will be              
              developed to expand the versatility of cze-based analytical                    
              techniques; and third, a new approach to high resolution cze which             
              utilizes electroosmotically counterbalanced electrophoresis (ECE)              
              will be developed and refined.  This project builds upon research              
              carried out by Professor Jorgenson and his students under NSF                  
              grant CHE-8912926.

              The successful attainment of the goals of this project will                    
              provide strongly enabling analytical tools that will be                        
              applicable to a broad spectrum of chemical, environmental, and                 
              biological problems.
