Abstract    :
              Reinforced concrete composite sandwich wall systems are becoming               
              very popular  due to the many benefits of combining lateral,                   
              gravity and in-plane loads along  with the thermal benefits of the             
              insulated sandwich construction.  These walls  typically consist               
              to two layers (wythes) of reinforced (or prestressed) concrete                 
              sandwich around a middle layer of insulation, providing sufficient             
              R-rating for  thermal efficiency.  In order to maintain the                    
              insulated rating and to prevent  a thermal short-circuit,                      
              non-metallic tie connectors, such as fiber-composite  ties are                 
              required.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              The objective of this research is to determine the amount of                   
              composite action  resulting in the sandwich system subjected to                
              lateral and bearing loads.  This  objective entails the development            
              of the commensurate analytical tools coupled  with the experimental            
              tests to verify the theory.  approximately 32-ft long wall  tests              
              subjected to lateral or bearing loads will be conducted.  Industry             
              collaboration and cooperation is a key element in shared cost and              
              participation  in this project.  This research is expected to                  
              result in a theoretical model for  analysis os future walls,                   
              behavioral characteristics (including amount of composite action),             
              design recommendations, and potential provisions for inclusion  in             
              new design standards.
