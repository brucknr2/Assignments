Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The proposal project is a case study of popular reaction to                    
              market reform in the formerly planned economies.  Using the case               
              of urban China, this study will examine popular reaction to                    
              reform by different groups and to different reform programs.  It               
              is argued that the success of market reform depends not only on                
              changing the economic system, but also on the acceptance of                    
              values related to market conditions, such as uncertainty,                      
              insecurity and inequality.  The data for this study are based on               
              18 national public opinion surveys conducted between 1985 and                  
              1991 in urban China.  The surveys cover a broad range of topics                
              to ensure a systematic examination of the different reform                     
              programs.  Similar questions were repeated in these surveys over               
              a significant time span so that events can be examined over time.              
              The Chinese PI will bring the survey data to the U.S. and spend                
              one year at the University of Pittsburg to work with the U.S. PI               
              on the project.  The results of the analyses will be published in              
              monograph form.  This research will be meaningful not only for                 
              understanding the reform process in China, but also for                        
              understanding other formerly planned economies that are                        
              undergoing transition to market and democracy.
