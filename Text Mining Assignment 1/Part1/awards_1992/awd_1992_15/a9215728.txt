Abstract    :
                   The goal of the project is to develop a micro-constructive                
              manufacturing process that will allow a designer to specify parts              
              of any geometry, any surface texture, any material, local material             
              composition and local microstructure.  Such a facbriation process              
              would enable the manufacture of parts and assemblies that can not              
              be made by using existing processes.                                           
                   The project will build on the success of the three dimensional            
              (3D) printing concept, which builds up parts in layers, from                   
              powders using ink-jet printing technology.  A particular feature               
              of the work is the detailed understanding of the underlying                    
              physical behavior of the powder and liquid phases during the 3D                
              printing process, with the goal of controlling the process                     
              sufficiently to give the desired level of flexibility.  The process            
              will also be used to fabricate a number of demonstration parts,                
              with targeted applications, that can not be fabricated by any other            
              means.  These prototypes may form the basis for the development of             
              advanced tooling systems for injection molding, thermoforming and              
              die casting which have integrated cooling passages, thermal                    
              isolation structures and engineered surface textures and composite             
              elements.  ***
