Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The proposed project is an empirical study of trade and                        
              telecommunications traffic between China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and               
              Macao.  It addresses theoretical issues raised by recent work on               
              trade in producer services and the role of knowledge spillover in              
              economic growth.                                                               
                                                                                             
              The study is designed to find out whether the volume and balance               
              of international telecommunications traffic can be explained by                
              assuming that trade in producer services constitutes a                         
              significant portion of that traffic.  If this assumption is                    
              valid, then the balance of incoming nd outgoing traffic should be              
              related in a definite way to the commodities trade balance and to              
              factor endowments.                                                             
                                                                                             
              This project involves collaboration between researchers in China,              
              the US, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.  Results of this study should                   
              contribute to trade theory, theories of economic growth, and                   
              understanding of the optimal framework for regulation of                       
              international telecommunications services.
