Abstract    :
                     This 1 Tesla SQUID magnotemeter will be applied to the                  
              measurement of  magnetic susceptibilities and electrical                       
              resistivities in a magnetic field on materials fabricated at                   
              Michigan State University.   Low magnetic field and a.c.                       
              magnetization measurements, will become possible, and it will also             
              be possible  to install a light pipe for magnetophotolysis studies.            
              This new instrument will permit higher sensitivity measurements of             
              susceptibilities and resistivities from 2 Kelvins to above room                
              temperature.  It will be shared equally among physicists and                   
              chemists, and will provide training for graduate and undergraduate             
              students.
