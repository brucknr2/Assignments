Abstract    :
                   The thermal and mechanical aspects of grinding introduce                  
              locked-in stresses into finished parts; these residual stresses                
              have been suspected of significantly affecting service life.                   
              Through an interdisciplinary examination of the cam grinding                   
              process, the project will develop the base science and engineering             
              technology that will allow an engineer to predict and control                  
              residual stresses in ground components, and understand the role of             
              residual stresses in the wear and fatigue of ground components.                
              The research team will comprise of engineers and scientists from               
              universities and American industries, with expertise in                        
              residual stress analysis and modeling, depth profiling of stresses,            
              thermal analysis and modeling, statistics, tribology, mechanical               
              metallurgy, fatigue, and failure analysis.  Major producers of                 
              testing equipment, of abrasives and grinding equipment, and of                 
              automobile engines and their related components, have committed                
              financial support, materials, equipment and facilities, as well as             
              the unique capabilities of their engineers, to gain an                         
              understanding of how machine grinding alters a part's properties               
              and durability.                                                                
                   The results should provide a significant competitive advantage            
              for American machine tool manufacturers in the development of                  
              uniquely instrumented grinding machines, and will have immediate               
              applicability to manufactures of products involving precision                  
              ground components.
