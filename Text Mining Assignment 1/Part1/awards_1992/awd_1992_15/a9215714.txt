Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support collaboration on the

              Dr. Richard Hutchinson, Colorado School of                                     
              Mines, and Han Fa, Chinese Academy of                                          
              Geological Sciences.  Work will involve study                                  
              of some of the largest tin deposits in the                                     
              world, which are located in China.  Most great                                 
              tin-producing districts contain morphologically                                
              different types of tin mineralization, and it                                  
              is important to distinguish among the types,                                   
              both geologically and in terms of genetic                                      
              process.   This study will improve the basic                                   
              understanding of the metallogeny of tin and of                                 
              the processes that lead to its enrichment to                                   
              commercially minable levels.  This in turn                                     
              could lead to improved exploration efficiency                                  
              by indicating new and different approaches in                                  
              exploration for tin deposits.                                                  
                                                                                             
              This study will involve continuing field study                                 
              in China, sample collection, and analytical                                    
              work.  The Chinese PI will visit Colorado to                                   
              continue analytical work, and several                                          
              publications are expected.
