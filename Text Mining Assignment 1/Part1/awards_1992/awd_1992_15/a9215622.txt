Abstract    :
              The results obtained in this project will provide needed                       
              quantitative criteria for the rational design of pressure tunnels              
              and shed light into the fundamental hydromechanic interactions                 
              occurring during hydrojacking of jointed rock masses.  The results             
              will also aid in estimation of magnitudes of inflow into                       
              underground openings from observed geologic data early in the                  
              project.  The flow regime due to dewatering and recharge of the                
              jointed rock mass will modeled to assess the effect of the                     
              hydromechanical properties of the joints and the attitude and                  
              spacing of the joints on the computed magnitudes of infiltration               
              rates into the tunnel or rates of exfiltrations into the masses.               
              The coupled hydromechanical rockliner interaction will be studied              
              to assess the effect of topography, hydromechanical joint                      
              properties and level of reinforcement in the liner, on the head                
              loss across the liner, magnitude of exfiltrations from the tunnel              
              and initiation of hydrojacking in the mass.
