Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              It is widely believed that most of the mass in our Galaxy lies in              
              one or more unseen "dark" components.  In the absence of direct                
              detection, the distribution of dark matter can be mapped by                    
              observing its gravitational effects on suitably chosen tracers of              
              the Milky Way's potential energy.  Observations of two different               
              tracers, Cepheid variable stars and K dwarfs, will be used to                  
              determine (a) the distance from the Sun to the center of the                   
              Galaxy, (b) the deviation from axisymmetry of the closed orbits                
              passing near the Sun, and (c) the mass surface density of the disk             
              of the Galaxy at the Sun's position.  The deviation from                       
              axisymmetry will be obtained by way of a search for new Cepheids               
              toward galactic longitude l = 60 degrees, complementing a recent               
              successful search carried out toward l = 300 degrees.  Followup                
              photometry will be obtained in the near infrared at 1.2, 1.6, and              
              2.2 microns, where the effects of interstellar extinction are                  
              substantially reduced.
