Abstract    :
                   An emerging theoretical framework in stream ecology attempts              
              to describe how physical disturbance regulates ecosystem structure             
              and function at multiple spatial scales.  A major goal of this                 
              emerging framework is to predict ecological attributes of lotic                
              ecosystems based on knowledge of geomorphology and hydrology, which            
              together can describe how stable or frequently disturbed benthic               
              habitats are.  The PI will characterize lotic invertebrate                     
              communities in functional terms (e.g., life history, mobility, size            
              spectra, and morpho-behavioral attributes) that should represent               
              integrated organism responses to physical disturbance.  Using these            
              non-taxonomic indices, The PI will test the hypothesis that                    
              community structure is quantitatively related to habitat stability             
              and disturbance.  Research will be conducted on 10 carefully-                  
              selected streams in the Eastern Deciduous Biome to isolate the                 
              mechanism (habitat disturbance) hypothesized to explain much                   
              variability in invertebrate community structure.
