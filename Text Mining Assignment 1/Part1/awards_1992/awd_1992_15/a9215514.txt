Abstract    :
                   The primary objective of the research is to examine the                   
              potential for generating and employing generic Concurrent                      
              Engineering (CE) design protocols that would improve design efforts            
              by adding consistency, while facilitating communications and data              
              sharing.  Sub-objectives and methods are as follows:  (1) examine              
              the detail of CE design protocols for two examples of two specific             
              component types in each of two specific manufacturing                          
              organizations; (2) explore the potential for consistency of the                
              detailed CE design protocol within a consistent component-                     
              type/design-culture using non-parametric analysis of variance;                 
              (3) develop strawman protocols for four component/organizations;               
              (4) conceptually design an attempt to prototype a computerized                 
              project management system to operate in conjunction with the                   
              protocol items.                                                                
                   The significance of the effort is in the knowledge of whether             
              world class CE follows generic protocols in consistent situations              
              and whether such protocols can be implemented through a project                
              management system.
