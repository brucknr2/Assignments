Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports planning activity to develop a continuing grant            
              proposal for the Institutional Infrastructure-Minority Institutions            
              (II-MI) program.  During the period supported, an advisory panel of            
              professionals from academia and industry will be formed to advise              
              on the development of computer science and engineering education               
              and research, trips will be made to some of the institutions                   
              holding II-MI grants, and relationships will be established with               
              three of the high performance computing centers.  The main research            
              focus will be in the area of advanced scientific computing.  The               
              outcome will be the preparation and submission of a comprehensive              
              five-year proposal.
