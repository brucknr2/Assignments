Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  In view of their large potential climate impacts, the role of             
              cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) in determining the global                      
              distribution of clouds and their optical properties is of great                
              current interest, but is not yet well understood.  Insight into the            
              nature of the steady states attainable in the marine boundary layer            
              will be obtained by simulating the interactions between aerosols,              
              clouds, and radiation using a simple model that describes the key              
              components of the system in a parameterized way.  The boundary-                
              layer cloud model to be developed, implemented, and tested                     
              includes:                                                                      
                                                                                             
              (1)  A physically based parameterization of CCN sources, sinks, and            
                   transports;                                                               
                                                                                             
              (2)  A parameterization of boundary-layer cloud formation and                  
                   dissipation, including the effects of drizzle formation as                
                   regulated by the predicted CCN; and                                       
                                                                                             
              (3)  A parameterization of radiative transfer in the cloudy                    
                   boundary layer, including both solar and terrestrial                      
                   radiation, and taking into account the cloud particle number              
                   density and size distribution and the cloud liquid water                  
                   content.                                                                  
                                                                                             
                   A case study from the 1992 Atlantic Stratocumulus Transition              
              Experiment (ASTEX) will be selected and used to test the model.                
              The proposed study will provide a foundation for future work to                
              incorporate CCN physics into general circulation models.
