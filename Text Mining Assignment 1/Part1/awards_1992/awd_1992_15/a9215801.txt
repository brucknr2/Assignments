Abstract    :
              In this project sponsored by the Experimental Physical                         
              Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Leone of the                
              University of Colorado will study how the collisions of rare                   
              earth atoms with inert gas atoms depend on the orientation and                 
              specific quantum states of reactants and products.  This work,                 
              including detailed theoretical calculations, will be extended                  
              to studies of reactive collisions which produce diatomic                       
              molecules in the gas phase.  The result will be a greatly                      
              increased understanding of the quantum basis of steric effects                 
              on simple chemical reactions.                                                  
              %%%                                                                            
              When molecules and atoms collide in chemical reactions, the                    
              reactivity and nature of the products formed depend on the                     
              detailed geometrical arrangement of incoming reactants at the                  
              moment of collision.  In this study Prof. Leone will use                       
              oriented atoms and will measure how this orientation is                        
              transferred to reaction products.  This will lead to a greatly                 
              improved understanding of precisely how orientation affects                    
              reactive collisions, thereby answering questions which have                    
              long been of interest in fundamental studies of chemical                       
              reactions.
