Abstract    :
              The research will examine stress corrosion cracking under the                  
              combined effect of stress and environment.  It will study                      
              dealloying theory which suggests that one constituent of the                   
              alloy is preferentially corroded, resulting in a very thin layer,              
              dealloyed surface, which could undergo brittle failure under high              
              stresses and high strain rates.  The approach will be a                        
              combination of experiments and analysis, on a model Cu-Au system,              
              using high resolution microscopy on one hand and eigen stress                  
              analysis on the other to treat the dealloyed surface layer.                    
              Mechanical properties of the dealloyed material will be studied                
              with bending of cantilever microbeams.
