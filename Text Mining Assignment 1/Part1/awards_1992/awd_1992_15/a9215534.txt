Abstract    :
                   This award supports a workshop on chemical effects on                     
              magnetization.  Current high-profile rock magnetic research in a               
              variety of areas in the Earth Sciences requires an in-depth                    
              understanding of the effects of chemical change on the                         
              magnetization of inorganic and biogenic (or biologically mediated)             
              magnetic minerals.  "Chemical change" we means a variety of                    
              processes: low- and high-temperature alteration, diagenesis, and               
              authigenesis.  The compounds of interest include hydroxides,                   
              oxides, and sulfides of iron.  Similarly, "magnetization" refers               
              both to room temperature properties (controlled by crystal                     
              structure, chemical composition, and grainsize) and to the natural             
              remanent magnetization produced by chemical and chemico-viscous                
              processes.  In order to have the strongest impact on research in               
              this interdisciplinary area, invites include (1) basic rock                    
              magnetists, (2) applied rock magnetists (working in the areas of               
              magnetic anomalies, climate change, biomagnetism, sedimentary                  
              magnetic records, etc.) and (3) the non-rock-magnetic specialists              
              such as isotope geochemists, biomagnetists, and soil chemists.
