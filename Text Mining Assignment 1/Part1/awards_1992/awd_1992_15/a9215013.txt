Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Funds are requested for a U.S.-EC Biotechnology Research Task                  
              Force, Workshop on Communicating Biotechnology with the Public,                
              March 22-25, 1992 in Dublin, Ireland.  The purpose of the                      
              workshop is to generate a set of practical recommendations on how              
              the United States Government (USG) and the Commission of the                   
              European Communities (EC) can improve their dialogues with the                 
              public about biotechnology.    The forty professional science                  
              communicators (20 U.S. and 20 EC) selected as participants all                 
              have first-hand experience in communicating with the public on                 
              biotechnology issues.  Drawing on the experience of the experts,               
              the workshop will generate recommendations on (1) how to                       
              accurately assess public opinion, (2) how to establish a flow of               
              information between (to and from) governmental entities and the                
              public, (3) the role of government institutions, scientists,                   
              public interest groups, educators and the media in science                     
              communications, and (4) how to evaluate the success or failure of              
              communication efforts.  The recommendations of the workshop will               
              be presented to the U.S.-EC Task Force on Biotechnology Research               
              in October 1982.
