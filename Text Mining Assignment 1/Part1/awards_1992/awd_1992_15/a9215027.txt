Abstract    :
                   This project will study a class of semipositive elliptic                  
              operators and their associated boundary value problems.  The                   
              interesting case, where the nonlinearity is negative at the                    
              origin, will be investigated and the existence and bifurcation of              
              the positive solutions will be analyzed. The results will further              
              our understanding of the properties of these solutions, as well                
              as the global nature of the set of solutions.                                  
                   Semipositive elliptic equations occur in the modeling of a                
              wide variety of real life phenomena such as predicting the rate                
              of growth or depletion of a population subject to predators,                   
              competition, or harvesting.  The main results will be applicable               
              in areas ranging from density of bacteria in an infected medium                
              to expectation of the survivability of a company subject to                    
              strong competition.
