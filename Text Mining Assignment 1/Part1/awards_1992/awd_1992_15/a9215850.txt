              Lincoln, to visit the Australian Antarctic

              New England in Australia during July 1993 and                                  
              1994. The research activity is focused on                                      
              Antarctic climatic history and will involve                                    
              close interaction with a team of Australian                                    
              investigators under the direction of                                           
              Dr. Patrick Quilty, the Assistant Director of                                  
              Science of the Australian Antarctic Division.                                  
              The Australian team includes Dr. Robert Hill                                   
              and Dr. Andrew McMinn from the University of                                   
              Tasmania and Dr. Barrie McKelvey from the                                      
              University of New England located in Armidale,                                 
              New South Wales.                                                               
                                                                                             
              New evidence from studies of geological                                        
              deposits on the Antarctic continent points to a                                
              major collapse of the East Antarctic Ice                                       
              Sheet during the middle Miocene and                                            
              significantly warmer marine and terrestrial                                    
              temperatures during the early to mid-Pliocene                                  
              (~4.5 to 2.5 million years ago). The survival                                  
              of terrestrial vegetation in Antarctica during                                 
              this period suggests that earlier glaciations                                  
              were not as cold as today. The research will                                   
              continue the U.S.-Australia cooperative study                                  
              of these significant terrestrial and marine                                    
              deposits and will address various features of                                  
              the environment and life in Antarctica during                                  
              this period of deglacial warmth. The research                                  
              will contribute critical southern high-latitude                                
              data to an international research effort toward                                
              a better understanding and modeling of Earth                                   
              under a warmer climate regime. Specifically the                                
              proposed research will produce and apply                                       
              paleobiological information to paleoclimatic                                   
              interpretations, will document the last                                        
              survivors of Antarctic marine and terrestrial                                  
              biotas, and will continue to develop                                           
              microfossils, particularly marine diatoms, as                                  
              tools for geologic age dating and                                              
              paleoenvironmental reconstructions in the                                      
              Antarctic.
