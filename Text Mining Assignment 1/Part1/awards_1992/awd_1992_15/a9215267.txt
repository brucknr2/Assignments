Abstract    :
                   Health care management is one of the most important research              
              topics in this country.  Planning activities at Arizona State                  
              University have developed a consortium based research Center                   
              program in addressing the health care management problems.                     
                   The formation of this Center is based on the early work                   
              supported by the Western Network for Education in Health                       
              Administration.  The proposed Center program is                                
              to develop an integration of industry, Arizona State University,               
              and the Western Network university consortium based on the NSF                 
              I/UCRC model.                                                                  
                   The initial research agenda of Arizona State University's                 
              I/UCRC for Health Care Management will address the following                   
              topics:  1) Develop new ways to organize and manage patient care               
              units; 2) Changing relationships between physician and                         
              organization; 3) Implementing new approaches to managing quality               
              and clinical outcomes.                                                         
                   The Principal Investigator/Center Director and his colleagues             
              with Arizona State University, Northwestern University, University             
              of Colorado, University of Washington, and U.C. Berkeley have the              
              knowledge and facilities to run this Center.                                   
                   This I/UCRC Program is being coordinated with Dr. John                    
              Castellan, Program Director of Decision, Risk, and Management                  
              Science Program at the National Science Foundation.                            
                   The Program Manager recommends Arizona State University be                
              awarded $50,000 for the first year of a five-year continuing award.            
                   Near the end of each 12-month period, the Program Manager                 
              and/or the Division Director of the Engineering Education Centers              
              Division will review the progress of the Center on a number of                 
              renewal criteria, including the following:  1) the extent to which             
              the university-industry interaction is developing; 2) the extent to            
              which the support base is developing; 3) the extent to which a                 
              robust research program is developing.  If the review is                       
              satisfactory, the Program Manager will recommend support for the               
              next period of this continuing award.
