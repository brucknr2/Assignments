Abstract    :
              This program proposes to determine the scope of the solubilization             
              phenomena of bimetallic etheralkoxides.  It aims to pursue this                
              type of reactions toward sol-gel synthesis of multicomponent oxides            
              other than 123-YBCO.  The complexation of copper, nickel, cobalt,              
              and zinc theralkoxides with sodium, potassium, rubidium, cesium,               
              strotium, barium, and lanthanum etheralkoxides will  be                        
              investigated.  The limiting stoichiometries will be determined in              
              each of the cases where soluble bimetallic complexes are formed.               
              The crystal structures of the bimetallic complexes will be                     
              determined with the use of the Reitveld refinement analysis.

              This proposal seeks to produce mutually soluble precursors and to              
              understand the formation of these complexes.  It will carry forth              
              this type of complexation reactions toward the preparation of                  
              multicomponent oxides.  This work has the potentials of expanding              
              greatly the availabilities of precursors for the sol-gel synthesis             
              method of producing multicomponent oxides.
