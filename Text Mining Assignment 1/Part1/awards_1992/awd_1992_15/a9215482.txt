Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to investigate and develop                        
              techniques needed to produce a tool that allows the                            
              applications programmer and computer designer to work closely                  
              to increase uniprocessor performance.  Computational units,                    
              such as the floating-point units, are becoming faster and                      
              readily available because of the rapid advances in technology                  
              and Computer-Aided Design (CAD) tools.  The performance,                       
              however, is limited by the rate at which data is applied to                    
              the units.  To achieve good uniprocessor performance, one must                 
              efficiently utilize the computational units, memory, and                       
              memory ports.  This may require that the applications                          
              programmer redesign the algorithms to better exploit the                       
              unique features of the architecture or the computer designer                   
              utilize CAD tools to design special-purpose processors that                    
              exploit the unique features of the algorithms or for best                      
              results, both.  This research will investigate and develop (1)                 
              techniques for extracting statistics on the utilization of the                 
              aforementioned processor resources and (2) methods for                         
              displaying the performance statistics to benefit both the                      
              applications programmer and the computer designer.  The                        
              results of this research will permit the applications                          
              programmer and computer designer to interact closely to                        
              address the problem of efficiently solving challenging                         
              problems such as climate modeling, vehicle dynamics,                           
              semiconductor modeling, and quantum chromodynamics, which are                  
              beyond the scope of existing computers.
