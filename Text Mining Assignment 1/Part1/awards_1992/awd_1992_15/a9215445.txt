Abstract    :
              It is proposed that a system of U.S. National Geotechnical                     
              Experimentation sites be established. Two NSF funded workshops                 
              have been held to discuss the required features of such sites and              
              the organization of a management system. Five sites have been                  
              identified for immediate development. These sites, and others                  
              that might be chosen in the future, would be open to all                       
              geotechnical researchers, where fundamental soil characteristics               
              have already been well defined and are readily available. Such                 
              sites exist in other countries and have contributed greatly to                 
              advancing their research base and technical capabilities.
