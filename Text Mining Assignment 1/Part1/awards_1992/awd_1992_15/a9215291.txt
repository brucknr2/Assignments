Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support for a conference on the changing                
              role of the United States in the Circumpolar North. The aims are               
              two-fold: to discuss priorities for U.S. arctic policy in the                  
              currently evolving political, social and economic climate, and to              
              expand communication among the agencies and organizations whose                
              decisions affect the Arctic. The conference will explore whether               
              current policies could benefit from revision, and recommend how                
              this may be achieved.
