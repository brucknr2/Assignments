Abstract    :
              The research will apply high temperature Moire interferometry and              
              high temperature digital image correlation to obtain strain and                
              displacement fields in the vicinity of crack tips under high                   
              temperature creep loading.  THe work will include microstructural              
              examination of damage initiation and growth to develop a better                
              understanding of the physics, at the same time advancing                       
              analytical and numerical solutions for the near tip stress-strain              
              fields.  The ultimate aim is to develop improved methods for                   
              prediction of creep damage in materials and structures.//
