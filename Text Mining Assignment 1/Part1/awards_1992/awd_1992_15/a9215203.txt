Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              With support from a Small Grant for Exploratory Research, a                    
              search will be conducted for evidence that there exists a                      
              regime of very large Reynolds numbers in which turbulence                      
              characteristics differ from those below this regime.  Both                     
              existing boundary layer turbulence measurements, and new data                  
              from a large Reynolds numbers fully developed pipe flow                        
              experiment to be built, will be searched for this evidence.                    
              Focus is on differences between the two conjectured regimes in                 
              the coupling of fluctuations very near the wall and those                      
              further out into the flow.                                                     
                                                                                             
              Discovery of changes in turbulence characteristics at very                     
              high Reynolds numbers would contradict the commonly held view                  
              that turbulence characteristics become more universal as                       
              Reynolds number increases.  This would impact the construction                 
              of predictive turbulence models and improve their accuracy and                 
              utility for various engineering systems.
