Abstract    :
                   The object of this project is to advance the state of                     
              knowledge in robustly representing, interrogating and manipulating             
              the geometry of complex objects using imprecise/discrete computer              
              arithmetic and developing the necessary theory and algorithms which            
              can form the basis for CAD/CAM systems of the future.  This theory             
              will involve primarily concepts of interval arithmetic and                     
              conditioning from numerical analysis as well as concepts of                    
              stability from differential topology, of simplicial complex theory             
              from algebraic topology, and basic concepts of differential                    
              geometry, all applied in computational geometry representations and            
              algorithms.                                                                    
                   Specific objectives are:  To analyze how interval non-uniform             
              rational B-spline curves and surface patches can be used to obtain             
              robust machine realizations of flexible free-form boundaries for               
              solids in a modeling system for complex objects.  To develop                   
              methods which allow stable Boolean operations.  To investigate how             
              local stability properties of adjacencies resulting from Boolean               
              operations.  To investigate how local stability properties of                  
              adjacencies resulting from Boolean operations can be integrated in             
              a global topological generalized Boundary Representation cell-                 
              tuple structure, so as to obtain consistent geometric results which            
              remain compatible with a variable numerical resolution.  To obtain             
              a reliable classification of cases where the resulting information             
              of the system is uncertain and those cases where the answer is                 
              specific.
