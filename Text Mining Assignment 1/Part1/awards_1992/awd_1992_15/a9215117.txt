Abstract    :
              ISI-9215117   Bio-Metric Systems,Inc.   Melvin J. Swanson         ABSTRACT      
                The main focus of this SBIR project is the development of   microporous
              polysulfone membranes which will incorporate   hydrophilic polymers with
              photoactivatable moieties to serve as   anchoring sites for antibodies.  It is
              expected that the polymeric  coupling agent will increase the binding activity
              of the antibody  while having very low nonspecific binding itself.  Effective  
              separation of target contaminant species will be demonstrated.       
              Purification of genetically engineering proteins and of   bioproducts formed by
              other means is often the greatest challenge  and expense for marketing.  The
              method described is generic and   potentially very powerful so that other
              biotechnology ventures   might benefit from this SBIR project.
