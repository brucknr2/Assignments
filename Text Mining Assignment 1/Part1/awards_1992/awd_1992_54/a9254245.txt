Abstract    :
              The content and pedagogy of the General Chemistry course for                   
              science majors is being revised to substantially reduce the                    
              importance of the lecture by utilizing small group cooperative                 
              learning procedures.  A renewed emphasis on descriptive                        
              chemistry, a reduction in the extent of the mathematical                       
              treatment of chemical concepts and the need for students to                    
              solve problems that requiring them to integrate material from                  
              previous studies are hallmarks of the new course sequence.
