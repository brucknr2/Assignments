Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The project will involve about 60% the 200 chemistry                           
              teachers of the state of Montana in a series of intensive                      
              concept workshops over the next three years.  The concepts                     
              which will be studied are determined by looking at the                         
              performance of the students on the ACS Chemistry Olympiad                      
              Examination items and coupling this with the teachers                          
              expectation.  Thirty 'lead' teachers will study the topics                     
              in depth at Montana State during two week workshops in the                     
              summer for each of three years.  These teachers will then                      
              hold regional workshops for teachers in their area (at least                   
              30/year) over the course of the next academic year.  During                    
              the next summer, they may study different topics and repeat                    
              the process.  At each of these regional workshops will be a                    
              faculty member from the main campus to assist in the                           
              teaching.  They will be highly interactive using the best of                   
              modern pedagogy to teach the students in the coming year.                      
              The cost share is 26% of the awarded Foundation funds.
