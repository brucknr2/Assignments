Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This 36 month project focuses on the 12 Connecticut urban                      
              Priority Districts with intensive teacher enhancement for                      
              middle schools.  All participants are part of CONNSTRUCT and                   
              thus have devised plans for reforming science education                        
              within their area.  The project provides Resource Network                      
              specialists, summer workshops for leadership teams, regional                   
              and local workshops, ten state-wide interactive video                          
              conferences per year, and on-site mentors.                                     
                                                                                             
              The proposal builds on state initiatives and ongoing                           
              projects to improve science education in the state.                            
              Moreover, the project forges cooperative relationships among                   
              the schools and between each school and the broader                            
              community.  An advisory board supports selected units many                     
              of which draw form other successful projects like Operation                    
              Physics, Insights: A Hands-On Science Curriculum and others.                   
              The basic format is a one week summer workshop for the                         
              Leadership team, Regional Workshops for teachers, and Local                    
              Workshops of 1-2 days catering to the local needs.  Mentors                    
              and interactive TV broadcast to 10 regional sites supporting                   
              the process.  Cost sharing is estimated at 38%.
