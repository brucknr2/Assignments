Abstract    :
              Establishment of Extended General Physics - An Alternative                     
              Course for Underprepared Students                                              
              Rutgers is the state university of New Jersey located in a                     
              urban area with 33,000 students on its New Brunswick campus.                   
              Most undergraduates at Rutgers are first generation college                    
              students and 30 percent are minorities.  Many are underprepared                
              to succeed in the sciences.  Our proposed project is to create                 
              a physics course specifically for underprepared science and                    
              pre-health profession majors that is rigorous, laboratory                      
              based, and non-threatening.  Based on our experience with a                    
              somewhat similar course for engineering students and the                       
              research findings and developments of others, we are designing                 
              a program with active lectures, cooperative learning, and                      
              qualitative and quantitative laboratories that will help our                   
              students succeed in science and pre-health profession majors                   
              and be exportable to other colleges and universities                           
              schools.***//
