Abstract    :
              9254694  Kamien    Field Museum of Natural History requests a $1,467,422 grant
              from  the National Science Foundation in partial support of final  planning and
              implementation of our LIFE OVER TIME exhibit and  associated interpretive
              programs.  This 21,000 square foot,  permanent exhibit will provide our 1.4
              million annual visitors with  an understanding of basic evolutionary principles
              and an overview  of the history of life from its origins through present.  The 
              exhibit will capitalize on Field Museum's extensive paleontological  and
              biological collections.  Developed in collaboration with the  Museum's
              scientific staff, the exhibit development team and many  outside consultants,
              the exhibit will attempt to address complex  scientific issues in an informal
              learning environment.  With a  projected cost of $5,775,000.  LIFE OVER TIME
              will open in 1994.  ***
