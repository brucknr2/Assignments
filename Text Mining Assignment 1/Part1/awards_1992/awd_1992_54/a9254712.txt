Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Brooklyn Children's Museum (BCM) is requesting $242,753 from               
              the National Science Foundation to introduce a traveling version of            
              the Museum's award-winning, interactive science exhibit, ANIMALS               
              EAT:  DIFFERENT FEASTS FOR DIFFERENT BEASTS.                                   
                                                                                             
              ANIMALS EAT was designed to assist children in the formation of                
              their concept of a living thing.  The exhibition specifically                  
              focuses on familiar animals, and on eating in order to illustrate              
              this complex idea.  Throughout the exhibit, where appropriate,                 
              human parallels demonstrate the interrelatedness of all living                 
              things.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              The touring exhibit will incorporate the in-depth research,                    
              development and extensive evaluation that went into the                        
              installation at BCM.  It will encompass approximately 2,000 square             
              feet and will travel to at least ten locations over a perior of                
              two-and-one-half years, offering hundreds of thousands of children             
              and families a unique and exciting way to learn important natural              
              science concepts.  As part of the touring package, the Museum will             
              also circulate Evi"Dents," a science curriculum kit developed for              
              grades 3-5.  Using activity books, natural science specimens and               
              investigation tools, Evi"Dents" provides an interactive seven-week             
              study of teeth for teachers and students that develops students'               
              scientific and research skills.  Through loans to local schools at             
              the tour sites, Evi"Dents" will complement and extend the                      
              educational potential of the exhibition.
