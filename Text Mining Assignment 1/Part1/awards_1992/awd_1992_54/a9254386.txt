Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The project would bring together 35 outstanding teachers                       
              from Nebraska identifying them as 'Fellows'.  These teachers                   
              would, over the course of the next three years, pursue a                       
              masters degree in economics.  The courses for the program                      
              are all regular catalog courses.  Special sections of each                     
              of the courses will have entry restricted to the institute                     
              Fellows.  Each of the Fellows will also be required to do a                    
              research project.  The selection of the Fellows will be                        
              based on regional considerations as well as population in                      
              order to have an appropriate number of people associated                       
              with each of the several Economic Educational Centers                          
              strategically located throughout the state.  Twenty five of                    
              the Fellows will ultimately be named as Center Associates                      
              where they will be required to set up other workshops and                      
              assist in other in service projects for the teachers of                        
              economics in their region.  Most, if not all, of the                           
              teachers of economics in Nebraska are expected to be                           
              impacted by this institute through the secondary effects.                      
              The cost share is 22.4% of the amount being requested from                     
              the Foundation.
