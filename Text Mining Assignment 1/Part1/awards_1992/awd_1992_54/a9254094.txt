Abstract    :
              The Workshop Physics system, in which traditional lectures and                 
              laboratories are replaced by interactive learning methods and                  
              micro-computer-based laboratory activities, will be used to                    
              provide a combined calculus-based/non-calculus introductory                    
              physics course.  Additional interactive methods such as                        
              conceptual exercises, collaborative problem-solving, and                       
              multimedia technology will be incorporated into the existing                   
              Workshop Physics curriculum. This will result in improved                      
              student learning and more efficient use of instructor time.
