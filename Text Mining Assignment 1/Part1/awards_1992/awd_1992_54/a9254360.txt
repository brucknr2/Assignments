Abstract    :
              In a cooperative effort between the College of Education and                   
              the College of Engineering, various techniques will be tested                  
              in the basic and required course, Materials Selection, (taught                 
              by one of the PI's) to involve students more intensely in the                  
              learning process.  Among the techniques that will be used are:                 
              video tapes study with faculty and TA's as facilitators,                       
              student projects, and an interactive socratic-type classroom                   
              environment.  Naturalistic evaluation techniques will be                       
              supervised by the College of Education. Students preparing to                  
              become teachers of science will also be involved in the project                
              as participants and later assistants in the engineering course.                
              They will also be affiliated with ongoing research projects in                 
              materials engineering and will participate in the research                     
              activities.
