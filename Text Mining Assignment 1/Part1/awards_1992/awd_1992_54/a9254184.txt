Abstract    :
              Building on experience in programs to upgrade the educational                  
              background of personnel working in industry, Dutchess Community                
              College will develop an integrated curriculum which could                      
              become a certificate program in basics for industrial                          
              technicians.  A faculty team will develop a single, unified                    
              course integrating elements from what are currently separate                   
              courses in introductory mathematics, chemistry, physics,                       
              English and reading.  Modern manufacturing will be used as the                 
              integrating theme.  The project will significantly change the                  
              undergraduate learning experience through the employment of new                
              curricula, innovative laboratories, new delivery systems, and                  
              fresh instructional materials.  It is hoped that the project                   
              will be a blueprint for the development of an industrial                       
              technology certificate granting program which could be                         
              replicated by other institutions of higher education,                          
              particularly technical colleges.
