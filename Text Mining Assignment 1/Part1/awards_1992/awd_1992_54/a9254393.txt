Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This 4-year project for 36 elementary teachers is a                            
              collaboration between EDC, the Technical Education Research                    
              Center (TERC), and Mount Holyoke College.  Each year of the                    
              program consists of a two-week summer institute, followed                      
              during the ensuing academic year by biweekly after-school                      
              meetings and bi-weekly class visitations by project staff.                     
              During the first two years , teachers and project staff focus                  
              on identifying and exploring the underlying organizing                         
              principles (the "big ideas") that their students must wrestle                  
              with as their understanding of mathematics grows.  In the last                 
              two years of the program, the focus shifts to helping the                      
              participants become teacher-leaders, who can successfully                      
              share their insights and skills in order to help other                         
              teachers change.  Participants--in collaboration with project                  
              staff--will produce written materials that can be used in                      
              other teacher enhancement projects.  The focus of Year 4 ia on                 
              school- and district-wide dissemination with cooperation of                    
              administrators.
