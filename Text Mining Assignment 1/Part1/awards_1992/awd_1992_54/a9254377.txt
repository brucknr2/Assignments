Abstract    :
                   The Quality Education for Minorities Network will create a                
              resource and project center to build capacity -- in as many as                 
              possible of the approximately 250 predominantly minority                       
              institutions of higher learning in the United States -- to respond             
              to and compete effectively for external grant funds for the                    
              strengthening of participation by minorities in the fields of                  
              science, mathematics, and engineering education.  QEM will                     
              establish on- and off-campus links with such institutions to help              
              them benefit fully from the programs of the National Science                   
              Foundation, in particular the Education and Human Resources                    
              directorate.  Over a period of three years, campus-by-campus needs             
              assessments will be done; workshops for proposal development and               
              project management will be conducted; and collaborative links will             
              be forged between institutions with similar or complementary                   
              characteristics.  Various kinds of communication systems will be               
              put in place within and between institutions, and between the                  
              institutions and QEM: for example, E-mail, electronic bulletin                 
              boards, document sharing, an 800 number at QEM, a Clearinghouse of             
              grants-related materials, and access to federal databases on                   
              science and math education and minority education.  For                        
              institutions presently receiving support from the NSF, the goal is             
              to improve proposal and project efficiency and to increase the rate            
              of successful proposals.  For institutions that are not presently              
              NSF grantees, the goal is to move them into the grantee category.
