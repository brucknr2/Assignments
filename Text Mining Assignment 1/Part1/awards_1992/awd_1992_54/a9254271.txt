Abstract    :
              A comprehensive integrated freshman educational experience                     
              suitable for both engineering and potential engineering                        
              students is being developed, which provides a "hands-on"                       
              introduction to engineering methodologies and problem solving.                 
              The curricular material for this two course sequence emphasizes                
              the integration of mathematics, physics, and chemistry into                    
              introductory engineering sciences through the use of carefully                 
              constructed open-ended problems.  Development of written                       
              communication skills and teamwork in problem solving and                       
              learning are also emphasized.  The project involves faculty                    
              from the University of Pittsburgh main campus, its branch                      
              campuses at Bradford, Greensburg, Johnstown, and Titusville and                
              the Community College of Allegheny County (CCAC). An important                 
              part of this project is the evaluation of curricular                           
              effectiveness and assessment of the impact of the new courses                  
              on student attitudes toward engineering and student performance                
              in course knowledge content compared with more traditional                     
              courses.  The lag in introduction of new course material at the                
              branch campuses and CACC provides an opportunity to evaluate                   
              the new curriculum materials against more traditional                          
              approaches.  New hands-on, project-oriented curricular                         
              material, complete with instructor's manuals, will be available                
              for other colleges and universities to adopt for their courses.
