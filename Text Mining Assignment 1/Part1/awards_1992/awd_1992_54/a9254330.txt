Abstract    :
              The project is developing software to make computer-aided                      
              chemistry experiments more accessible to students who have                     
              visual impairments.  The software is to run on an ordinary                     
              personal computer equipped with adapted outputs (synthetic                     
              speech, electronic music, and enlarged text and graphics).                     
              Experimental data is acquired through a modular data                           
              acquisition subsystem designed for use in educational                          
              laboratories.  Experiments for which software is being                         
              developed include the instrumental methods commonly used in                    
              lower level chemistry courses, and the software includes a data                
              analysis package which enables visually impaired students to                   
              perform extensive analysis on data acquired with the system.                   
              The system and its software will be usable at any educational                  
              level where instrumental measurements are performed, and should                
              be readily adaptable to disciplines other than chemistry.
