Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              An examination of the factors that shape the recruitment and                   
              retention of women and minority students in mathematics, biology,              
              psychology, physics, and chemistry classes and majors in                       
              comprehensive public universities.  The study isgrounded in an                 
              integrative theoretical model of the factors determining                       
              academicchoice.  Three levels of academic community structure will             
              be explored--institutional, departmental, and student.  The                    
              structure of students' experience in introductory courses and                  
              gender and race differences will be explored applying an                       
              expectancy-value model to the prediction of students' choices of               
              major and describing the most influential determinants.  A                     
              theoretical model for the successful recruitment and retention of              
              women and minorities will be developed.
