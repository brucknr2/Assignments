Abstract    :
              Typical engineering courses emphasize closed-ended examples and                
              problems.  While these problems aid in the development of                      
              convergent thinking skills, they usually do not provide                        
              practice for improving the divergent thinking patterns                         
              essential for the solution of industrial and research problems.                
              This proposal presents a plan for enhancing the problem-solving                
              and synthesis skills of first-year engineering students to                     
              develop a mind-set lasting throughout their college careers and                
              professional lives.  This enhancement will be achieved through                 
              an innovative, required first-year course. In a first-year                     
              class of over 1,000 students, it is virtually impossible to                    
              achieve the ideal one-on-one interaction required to develop                   
              divergent thinking skills.  In the proposed first-year course                  
              interactive computer modules and open-ended problems will be                   
              used in conjunction with lectures and exercises that present a                 
              robust problem solving heuristic.  The computer modules will                   
              allow the students to make decisions in gray areas at branch                   
              points in decision trees, to troubleshoot, and to make                         
              decisions on what data they need to access from the computer.                  
              Our previous work on writing interactive modules has resulted                  
              in our developing strategies that individualize the                            
              instruction. The students will then work in groups to apply                    
              these concepts to solve open-ended design problems, written at                 
              such a level that first-year students will be able to generate                 
              innovative solutions.  These group interactions, requiring a                   
              written report, will provide a framework to enhance the                        
              students' interpersonal and communications skills.  The                        
              proposed project will initially have the potential to influence                
              over 1,000 first-year engineering students.  Further, the                      
              modules and material developed will then be distributed to                     
              other engineering colleges across the nation.
