              The New York Hall of Science requests $829,312 over four years                 
              to develop and circulate a traveling version of "Hidden                        
              Kindoms - The World of York Hall of Science in April, 1991.                    
              The traveling version will consist of:  an introductory panel;                 
              16 Easy-View microscopes exhibiting living microbes; units                     
              dealing with size, scale and magnification; two interactive                    
              computer programs entitled "Understanding AIDS" and "How Your                  
              Body Fights Disease"; a video microscope for the Microscopic                   
              Life demonstration; units on virusesand bacteria; a mosaic of                  
              color transparencies of different microorganisms; one Optech                   
              (BYOB) interactive video microscope; three zoetropes                           
              illustrating mcrobial movement; and a mini-laboratory room                     
              containing all the equipment and materials necessary for

              to students and teachers.  The 1,500 square foot exhibit will                  
              travel to nine sites over three years.

              laboratory with its equipment and four Easy-View microscopes                   
              which can become the core of a microbiology program.
