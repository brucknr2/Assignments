Abstract    :
              9254439  Hooper  The Project to Improve Science Models (PRISM) is a multifaceted
               plan to improvethe science preparation of all prospective  teachers of grades
              1-9 by transformingpreservice courses and  field experiences.  Objectives of
              this project are university  faculty collaborating with professional teachers
              to effect the  undergraduate educationof pre-service teachers in order to: 
              increase understanding of science concepts,processes and  skills; develop
              creative skills and positive attitudes toward  science; and ultimately transfer
              these competencies into  classrooms.  The major components of the project
              include the  development of:  three core content courses (12 semester hours) 
              integrating six science disciplines; a 3 semester hour infused  methods course;
              effective modeling of multimedia instructional  technology; a mentor teacher
              network, and a science resource  center.  The project is a collaboration
              developed by a steering  committee of eight teachers working with university
              faculty,  input from both Arts and Sciences faculty and Education  faculty,  60
              area teachers, and a local educational consortia,  CESAs.  The University
              faculty is designing integrated courses  infusing multimedia technology; the
              teachers serve as mentors  for over 1000 prospective teachers; and, CESAs
              provides  technical assistance, educational materials, and  logistical support.
               Materials being developed make the project  model available and transportable
              so as to affect positive  changes in 1-9 preservice teacher education.  ***y
