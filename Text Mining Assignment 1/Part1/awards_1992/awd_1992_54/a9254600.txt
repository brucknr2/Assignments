Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The project is a continuation of an earlier project which took                 
              30 minority teachers or teachers of minorities (classes are                    
              >50% minority) each year to update their content knowledge in                  
              chemistry.  They were given lectures and laboratories over the                 
              course of two summers of work, each of four weeks duration, at                 
              the University of California at Berkeley.  They were also                      
              immersed in examples and discussions about the different                       
              learning styles of culturally diverse people including                         
              teaching skills.  This program is specifically to provide the                  
              second summer experience for those who have had only a single                  
              summer experience.  The cost share for this project is 3% of                   
              the grant.
