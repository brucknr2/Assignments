Abstract    :
              A pilot program will be developed which will serve as a model for              
              a year-long three-course series to meet the general science                    
              education requirement for students from 30 majors and the non-                 
              science colleges across 20 California State University campuses.               
              The major objective is to test the feasibility of using material               
              integrated and presented, not by discipline, but by common features            
              across the disciplines. Students are expected to achieve a deep                
              understanding of the scientific method and the most important                  
              theories and mechanisms of seven sciences (Astronomy, Physics,                 
              Geology, Chemistry, Biology, Computer Science and Mathematics)                 
              through a series of computer modules using systems process as                  
              unifying themes to present, explain and show the similarities                  
              between in-depth case studies from the disciplines. The pilot will             
              emulate the innovative, hybrid method planned for 30-week courses,             
              using computer-based multimedia modules that provide computer-based            
              self-study, use of case studies from the individual disciplines,               
              weekly group discussion, skill training sessions and general                   
              assembly debates, and a fully inter-disciplinary lab, all involving            
              team teaching.                                                                 
              The project would result in twenty specific products that are                  
              highly portable to other campuses including multimedia modules,                
              their multidisciplinary team-produced "scripts",study pamphlets for            
              each module, guidelines for discussion groups and one set of seven             
              interdisciplinary laboratory protocols.
