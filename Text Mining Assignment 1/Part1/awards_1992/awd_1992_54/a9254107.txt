Abstract    :
              A materials-oriented approach to chemistry is being developed                  
              through the preparation of "A Materials Chemistry Companion to                 
              General Chemistry", by an ad hoc committee of two dozen leading                
              chemistry researchers and teachers.  Consisting of text,                       
              problem sets, model kits, software, videotapes, demonstration                  
              and laboratory experiments, the "Companion" is scheduled for                   
              publication by the American Chemical Society in 1993.  The                     
              "Companion" will demonstrate how virtually every topic                         
              typically covered in introductory chemistry courses can be                     
              illustrated with solids such as polymers, semiconductors,                      
              metals, superconductors, and ceramics.  The project focuses                    
              both on innovation - the completion of material for the                        
              "Companion" - and on change - the implementation of a national                 
              strategy for assimilating materials chemistry into introductory                
              chemistry courses.  Strategies for effecting change include                    
              national testing of the "Companion" at over two dozen                          
              volunteering college test sites (more than 15,000 students);                   
              development of modules based on the "Companion" and their use                  
              in workshops for college and pre-college teachers; and critical                
              evaluation of the instructional materials.  The "Companion" and                
              supporting activities will revitalize general chemistry                        
              courses, enhance the scientific literacy of students and                       
              teachers, and increase the number and diversity of high-quality                
              students electing to pursue careers as chemists, chemistry                     
              teachers, scientists and engineers.
