Abstract    :
              Computer Science educators are faced with the dilemma that one                 
              cannot do computer science well without being a good                           
              programmer, nor can one understand the underpinnings of                        
              computer science without a strong background in mathematics.                   
              The goal of this project is to use the first three courses of                  
              the computer science major to make students fluent speakers of                 
              mathematics and programming, and to expose them to both                        
              functional and imperative language paradigms so that they can                  
              effectively learn computer science.  Computer Science I and                    
              Discrete Mathematics, taken in the first semester, will                        
              carefully articulate the strong ties between mathematics and                   
              programming through an integrated curriculum, a functional                     
              programming language and a shared laboratory.  Computer Science                
              Il, taken during the second semester, will bridge the gap                      
              between the mathematical perspective of the first semester and                 
              the implementation of an algorithm as a sequence of                            
              instructions through an imperative language.  All courses will                 
              also provide a strong foundation for the computational concepts                
              that are considered in advanced courses.  The approach used                    
              exposes students to theoretical concepts in mathematics and                    
              computer science without having these concepts walled off as                   
              abstractions unrelated to applications, and it gives students                  
              extensive programming experience without neglecting important                  
              theoretical concepts that are the foundations of correctness                   
              and the basis for generalization and creative work.
