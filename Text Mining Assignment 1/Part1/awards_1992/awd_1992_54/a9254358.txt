Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will bring an average of 20 middle, secondary                     
              and community college teachers to Washington State                             
              University for a little more than six weeks during the                         
              summer.  During this time the teachers will be totally                         
              engaged in a research project of the mentor engineering                        
              faculty.  The aim of the project is to make teachers more                      
              aware of the nature of engineering and to incorporate some                     
              teaching modules into their classrooms based on their                          
              research experience.  There will be substantial follow-up of                   
              the research experience with visits by the mentor faculty to                   
              the participants classroom during the year as well as the                      
              participants return to the University to present papers on                     
              the experience with their teaching modules.  The project                       
              will directly engage approximately 60 teachers directly in                     
              the three years of the project.  The cost share is 37.4% of                    
              Foundation support.
