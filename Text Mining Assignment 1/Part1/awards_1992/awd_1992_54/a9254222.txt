Abstract    :
              For the past three years, we have been developing and offering                 
              an innovative course, "Discovering Physics," for non- science                  
              majors. We are now broadening the approach we have been taking,                
              which includes elements of the "discovery technique and the                    
              small-group "complex instruction" learning environment, to both                
              the elementary/middle school level and the standard college                    
              science-major physics sequence. The original course is being                   
              expanded to two semesters, and is being aimed especially at                    
              students planning to go into precollege teaching; active                       
              participation of current teachers is also being emphasized, as                 
              an important part of the developing partnership between the                    
              University and the Worcester Public Schools. The course will                   
              retain its stress on understanding nature through direct                       
              experience and the concepts which grow out of careful                          
              consideration of these experiences; we are continuing to                       
              encourage students to ask "How do we know...?" and "Why do we                  
              believe...?" questions about physical phenomena. Our program                   
              welcomes, and has been successful with both male and female                    
              students and students from groups traditionally under-                         
              represented in science. To promote a broad, national impact,                   
              are producing a "discovery workbook," a teacher's manual, and                  
              associated software. An outstanding group of consultants is                    
              working with us in the various aspects of this project.
