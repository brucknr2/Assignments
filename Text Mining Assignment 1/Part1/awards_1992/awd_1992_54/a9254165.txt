Abstract    :
              The Mathematics Improvement Project (MIP) represents a                         
              concentrated effort to increase the numbers of underrepresented                
              students majoring in science, mathematics, or engineering at                   
              the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) by focusing on                   
              their successful completion of College Algebra and Pre-                        
              calculus.  The project is incorporating programmatic structures                
              that facilitate faculty training, curricular design, and                       
              implementation of pedagogical practices designed to both meet                  
              the special needs of underrepresented students and to promote                  
              critical thinking and mastery of mathematical concepts.  Four                  
              faculty within the Division of Mathematics, Computer Science,                  
              and Statistics (MCSS) at UTSA are working as MIP faculty and                   
              are designing and implementing a culture-sensitive learning                    
              environment as well as a non-traditional instructional                         
              curriculum to insure that students are prepared to work in the                 
              global community in the 21st century.  Although the program is                 
              open to all students, underrepresented students enrolling in                   
              College Algebra and Pre-calculus are being targeted.  Through                  
              collaboration with the university's Student Services offices                   
              and by formalizing ties with local schools and community                       
              colleges, this program is implementing an effective system of                  
              recruitment, retention, and successful completion of the MIP                   
              mathematics sequence for underrepresented students.  MIP's                     
              pipeline is generating a new momentum which allows students to                 
              build confidence and to achieve an incremental gain in skills                  
              powerful enough to ensure success in future mathematics                        
              courses.  The overall goal is to increase the rate of                          
              undergraduate students successfully completing the math                        
              sequence by at least 20%.***//
