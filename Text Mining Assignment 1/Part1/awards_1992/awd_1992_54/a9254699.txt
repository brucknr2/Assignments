Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This proposal requests matching support to create a dynamic               
              science, engineering, and technology careers museum exhibit--SET               
              Careers, for distribution to science museums and technology                    
              centers.  The exhibit kiosks with related career graphics                      
              surrounds, incorporate multimedia platforms, using MacIntosh                   
              authoring software to dreate information landscapes' computer                  
              motion programs like Quicktime, and Cd-1 or DVI videodisc                      
              technology.  Yound museum visitors (teens and Preteens) will be                
              invited to enter into an exciting interactive exploration of thirty            
              self-narrated video profiles of people in science and engineering,             
              try our  animated/reality video simulations of a work experience in            
              these fields, and obtain additional information from a database of             
              over 200 more science and math-based professions.  The videodisc               
              profiles, database, and a personal interests component will also be            
              developed in alternative media formats (video, audio, print,                   
              computer disc) for broad distribution to community and youth                   
              education networks, schools, and libraries.                                    
                                                                                             
                   Specific emphasis in this project is being placed on reaching             
              and attracting female, minority, and disabled youths.
