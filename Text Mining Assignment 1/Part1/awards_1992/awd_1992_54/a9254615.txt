Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Science Museums of Charlotte, Inc.  will develop a 5500                   
              square foot traveling exhibit on SCIENCE of FASHION for the                    
              Science Museum Exhibit Collaborative (SMEC).  Opening in                       
              February 1994, SCIENCE of FASHION will tour eight major U.S>                   
              cities over thirty-two months, introducing 2.5 million people                  
              to principles of chemistry, physics, biology, mathematics, and                 
              technology that drive the textile industry.                                    
                                                                                             
                   SCIENCE of FASHION integrates diverse disciplines and                     
              will help public explore science in a wholistic manner.                        
              Because the subject matter is somewhat unusual fare, SCIENCE                   
              of FASHION will help diversify audiences, drawing in                           
              population segments, particularly women, who may not normally                  
              visit science museums.  SCIENCE of FASHION is an eloquent                      
              vehicle for science-rich exhibitry which teaches the                           
              mathematics of pattern geometry, production statistics, and                    
              retail costs, polymer chemistry for engineering new fabrics,                   
              the genetics of new natural colors and strong aware fibers,                    
              and the sophisticated research, robotics, and computerized                     
              technologies that keep America's textile  industry at the top                  
              international commerce.                                                        
                                                                                             
                   Rigorous evaluation will ensure a satisfying product that                 
              is educationally-effective, durable, and appealing to a broad                  
              public audience.  SCIENCE of FASHION will be a worthy addition                 
              to the rich menu of science fare in SMEC exhibitry.
