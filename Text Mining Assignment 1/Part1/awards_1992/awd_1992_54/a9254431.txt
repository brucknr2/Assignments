Abstract    :
              9254431  Soileau    The East Baton Rouge School Parish has planned a five-year 
              district-wide teacher enhancement effort for physical science in  grades K-3. 
              This project builds on a state-funded pilot project in  five elementary
              schools.  Two teachers in each of the district's 63  elementary schools will
              receive training in the use of hands on  kits, background science content,
              inquiry teaching methods,  performance assessment of students, and integration
              of science with  other subjects.  Design of the workshops and instruction of
              the  teachers will be the responsibility of Gayle Kirwan (American  Institute
              of Pysics).  Teachers will attend several three-week  graduate workshops at
              LSU, during which they will learn content and  instructional methods tied to
              hands-on kits.  These teachers will  provide inservice training to the other
              teachers in their schools.   Principals will receive two days of training when
              their school  enters the program.  Student enrollment in the Parish is nearly
              60%  African-American, Hispanic, or other underrepresented groups.  The  Parish
              has been undergoing the transition to site-based decision  making, and
              standardized testing is being replaced by portfolio or  other performance-based
              assessment tools in many schools.  The  Parish has sent a team to the
              NSTA/Monsanto Institute and to the  NSRC Leadership Institute.  Partnerships
              have been formed with  Panasonic, Monsanto, and Dow Chemical.    This reform
              effort has the potential to create exemplary science  instruction for tens of
              thousands of minority school children, and  to provide a model for systemic
              reform in rural districts.    Cost sharing on this project represents 79% of
              the NSF  contribution.
