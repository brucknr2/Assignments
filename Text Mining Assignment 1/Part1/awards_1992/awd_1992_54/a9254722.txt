Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This planning grant will lead to a proposal from the Alabama                   
              Science Teachers Association (ASTA) and the Alabama                            
              Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research                         
              (Alabama EPSC0R) to extend and expand the Chemistry for                        
              Elementary Teachers (C4ET) to Physical Science for                             
              Elementary Teachers (PSRET).  The university has made a                        
              major commitment to the philosophy and content of the C4ET                     
              and now wished to plan, develop, coordinate and disseminate                    
              a comparable physical science approach through six                             
              university sites.  The planning grant will fund the                            
              formation of teams at each of the six Alabama sites and the                    
              coordination of their work into a full proposal to the NSF.                    
              The grantee provides cost sharing of 241%.
