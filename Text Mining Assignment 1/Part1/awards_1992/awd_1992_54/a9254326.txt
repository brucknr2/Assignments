Abstract    :
              In this project at least 100 short case studies or mathematical                
              "snapshots" are being created.  Each is designed to encourage                  
              appreciation of mathematics among under-achieving and under-                   
              motivated students.  Following the compilation of these modules                
              involving substantial library research  and industry support,                  
              they will be class tested at several institutions.                             
              The project's short case studies differ from existing case                     
              studies (UMAP, C0MAP, etc.).  They require few prerequisites,                  
              are shorter, rely mainly upon oral presentation by instructors,                
              and are adaptable to a broad range of textbooks.  They are                     
              supplements to existing course work designed to motivate                       
              student interest in the subject matter and to show its                         
              relevance.  Among the studies' goals is  highlighting                          
              contributions of under-represented groups, thereby providing                   
              role models for students.                                                      
              The project is based upon preliminary work which yielded                       
              promising results.  The studies are being drawn from a broad                   
              range of fields, all highlighting a "snapshot" of applied                      
              mathematics.  After classroom testing, the project concept and                 
              results will be disseminated by a regional seminar.  During                    
              this seminar, not only will participating instructors learn                    
              about the project and receive a booklet containing the                         
              developed modules, but these faculty will also be provided the                 
              skills and knowledge necessary to design and implement studies                 
              for their classrooms.
