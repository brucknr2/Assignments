Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  ONE, TWO, THREE...INFINITY:  The World of Mathematics is                  
              a series of eight one-hour films about math in the real world.                 
              It will be produced by WQED/Pittsburgh for prime-time                          
              broadcast on the 340 PBS stations and in many foreign                          
              countries.  The goal of the series is not to "teach" math but                  
              to show, in an entertaining fashion, the importance of math in                 
              many walks of life--music, art, engineering and                                
              communications, to name a few.  Math affects our lives                         
              everyday in ways many of us have never imagined.  Yet few of                   
              us ever stop to think about it, perhaps because of "Math                       
              anxiety." This series will be the first to reveal math's                       
              importance not only as a tool for discovery, but also as a                     
              major cultural force.  Drawing on WQED's proven skill in                       
              creating special visual effects, and making liberal use of                     
              magic and mystery, puzzles, and paradoxes, the series will                     
              break down the public's fears and misconceptions about math.                   
              We hope viewers--children as well as adults--will come away                    
              with a new appreciation of mathematics and, most important, a                  
              more open attitude toward learning about it--the first step                    
              toward a higher level of math literacy.  WQED's Producers and                  
              cinematographers bring many years of experience on such award-                 
              -winning programs as PLANET EARTH, THE INFINITE VOYAGE and the                 
              NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC SPECIALS. A diverse and distinguished                      
              advisory committee will help shape the series and ensure its                   
              accuracy.  And a companion book, together with a program of                    
              educational materials and activities, will extend its reach                    
              beyond the television audience, making the series a potent                     
              catalyst for learning.
