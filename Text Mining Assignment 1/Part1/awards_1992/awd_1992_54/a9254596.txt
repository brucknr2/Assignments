Abstract    :
              The Harvard Graduate School of Education seeks funding to                      
              establish the Mathematics Case Development Project: Converting                 
              Barriers to Bridges(MCDP) - The objective of this project is to                
              develop teacher preparation materials in the form of teaching                  
              cases and teaching notes that will enable prospective teachers to              
              explore important mathematical concepts in depth while                         
              encouraging the development of desirable teaching practices. The               
              project also will offer seminars and specific dissemination                    
              activities for mathematics educators to learn about this                       
              approach.                                                                      
              The 2 1/2 year project will produce 18 written teaching cases and              
              accompanying teaching notes on a range of 5-12 mathematical                    
              concepts identified by researchers and practicing teachers as                  
              particularly difficult to teach -- including especially those                  
              areas where human intuition often fails the mathematics student.               
              Teams comprised of teacher educators and mathematicians from                   
              Harvard University, the University of Massachusetts, Boston and                
              the University of New Hampshire and practicing teachers will join              
              to develop, pilot and revise the case materials.                               
              The (MCDP) Project will have a potential impact on novice                      
              mathematics teachers, with a possible extension to experienced                 
              mathematicians and mathematics teacher educators, and the larger               
              teacher education community.
