Abstract    :
              This project is designed to increase the technical literacy and                
              awareness of the general population of Mission College students                
              through cooperation with regional colleges and universities as                 
              well as industry. The College plans to develop a course which                  
              is easily transportable throughout the State of California. A                  
              statewide network is currently in place through which the                      
              results can be quickly disseminated. Project activities include                
              outreach to scientists and engineers in the community,                         
              collaboration with faculty in various disciplines, visiting                    
              counterpart schools, researching topics, experimentation, and                  
              the construction of simple prototypes.
