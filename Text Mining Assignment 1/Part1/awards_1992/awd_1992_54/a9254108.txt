Abstract    :
              This project will develop an interdisciplinary course sequence                 
              aiming to satisfy natural and social science general education                 
              requirements. Three critical issue science modules and                         
              laboratories to be developed are: Global Climate Change, Energy                
              Options for the Future, and Biodiversity Conservation. In                      
              addition to a thorough treatment of the science and engineering                
              content of these issues, the course will innovate in content                   
              presentation in three explicit ways: (1) Theoretical knowledge                 
              will be integrated with labs and simulations for direct issue-                 
              investigation by the students. (2) All learning will converge                  
              on decision-making activities, including critical evaluations                  
              of contemporary news reports.  (3) Decisions will be carried                   
              forward through exploration of problem solving action                          
              opportunities in the campus community, permitting students to                  
              use, immediately and in practical ways, what they learn in the                 
              course.  As a result scientific knowledge will be communicated                 
              in a framework that will more effectively motivate especially                  
              non-science students and enhance creativity and critical                       
              thinking in science and technology. Research will be conducted                 
              to determine the effectiveness of these modules and innovative                 
              teaching strategies.
