Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This 4-year project, involving a total of 80 K-8 teachers in                   
              the greater Boston area, has three basic aims: (1) to shift                    
              teachers' beliefs about the nature of teaching and learning                    
              mathematics; (2) to deepen and broaden the teachers' knowledge                 
              of mathematics itself; and (3) by capitalizing on (1) and (2),                 
              to introduce fundamentally new instructional practices into                    
              the classroom.  In Phase I (Years 1 and 2), the 3                              
              participating districts each send a team of 8 teachers to the                  
              program, and--to  help assure district-wide, systemic change--                 
              a principal, a mathematics supervisor and an associate                         
              superintendent as well.  The format of the program in each of                  
              the four years of the project is similar:  a 4-week summer                     
              institute, followed during the ensuing school year by "inquiry                 
              groups" (facilitated by project staff) that meet every other                   
              week after school.  Year 1 focuses on initiating fundamental                   
              changes in the participating teachers' beliefs and practices;                  
              in year 2, the same teachers change their beliefs and                          
              practices also.  In Phase II (Years 3 and 4) the project                       
              begins a collaboration with EdCo--a consortium of school                       
              districts in the greater Boston Area.  Phase II involves 36                    
              new teachers.  Research/evaluation is an important component                   
              of the program that seeks to document and understand in rather                 
              fine detail the histories (external and internal) of the                       
              teachers in the process of trying to make radical changes in                   
              their professional views and practices.  Finally, a                            
              dissemination strand aims at developing teachers enhancement                   
              materials for use by others, which will be publicized by                       
              participants and project staff at a variety of professional                    
              meetings.
