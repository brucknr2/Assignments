Abstract    :
              9254427  Saltman    The University of California, San Diego (UCSD) in
              collaboration  with the San Diego Unified School District will develop a
              Science  Teacher Enhancement and  Enrichment Project (STEEP) which will 
              enhance the science background and leadership skills of  approximately 400 K-6
              teachers.  This pilot project will develop  and test an implementation strategy
              for bring hands-on inquiry  based science to all of the elementary schools of
              city.  The  leadership training will begin with a three week summer program 
              for two years at UCSD.  During the year, selected teachers from  past
              leadership academies will support the newly trained teachers  as they introduce
              their own students to the new hands-on units.  Once they are comfortable with
              the new content and instructional  strategies needed for the new units the
              leadership teachers will  provide support for their colleagues as they begin to
              teach the  newly adopted instructional programs.    The cost sharing will be
              thirty-two percent of the National  Science Foundation Award.  ***
