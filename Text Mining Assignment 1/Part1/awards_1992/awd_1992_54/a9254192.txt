Abstract    :
              Oceanography is taken by 25% - 40% of our first year class, and                
              it may be the only science course many of these students                       
              experience. As a large class, it has high visibility on campus                 
              and presents a vital challenge in efforts to provide each                      
              student with a dynamic and exciting learning experience.  Funds                
              are requested to support the creation of a set of interactive                  
              Macintosh computer based laboratory tutorial/simulations, a                    
              comprehensive help database, and an associated workbook.  This                 
              material will be integrated with the existing graphics database                
              and computer automated quiz serving and fading software, and it                
              will be available on CD ROM and Internet to other colleges and                 
              universities teaching oceanography.  Many of the ideas and                     
              approaches developed for this project also will be useful to                   
              others teaching large classes in other disciplines.  The goal                  
              is to make this large class experience every bit as exciting                   
              and dynamic as that in smaller classes by creating material                    
              that will truly engage the students in the subject matter,                     
              supported by a class structure that encourages student                         
              responsibility and integrative thinking.
