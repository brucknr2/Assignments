Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The National Gardening Association will be offering a                          
              four-year program of professional development for elementary                   
              teachers interested in inquiry-centered teaching using                         
              plants in the classroom.  This program will provide                            
              three-week summer workshops and follow-up support to                           
              leadership teams of teachers, school administrators, and                       
              community partners from 16 urban sites.  These teams will                      
              become experts in the use of GrowLab, an instructional                         
              program developed with NSF support by the National Gardening                   
              Association, and Fast Plants, another NSF-supported                            
              instructional program, developed at the University of                          
              Wisconsin.  Private businesses and informal learning centers                   
              such as botanical gardens and horticultural clubs will                         
              provide content support to teachers.  The teams of                             
              participating teachers will offer professional development                     
              opportunities to other teachers in their region, and act as                    
              advocates for inquiry-centered teaching in elementary                          
              classrooms.  More than 360 teachers, administrators, and                       
              community partners will be reached directly or indirectly by                   
              this program of leadership development.  A national network                    
              and newsletter will also disseminate news of this project.                     
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing represents 50% of the NSF contribution.
