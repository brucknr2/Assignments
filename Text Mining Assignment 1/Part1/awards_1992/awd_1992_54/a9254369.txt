Abstract    :
              A new type of laboratory experience is being developed for a                   
              general education physics course primarily based on experiments                
              carried out by students in their own residences utilizing a kit                
              of inexpensive components and directed by a carefully crafted                  
              laboratory handbook supplemented by a few video tapes.  The                    
              tangible results of the project will be a tested evaluated,                    
              laboratory course based on this kit of equipment, the                          
              professional laboratory manual available in printed and                        
              computer readable form, and the videos.  These materials will                  
              be made available for adoption by other schools.  The program                  
              will be easily  transferable, easily modified, and self-                       
              financing in that a net savings of many dollars will                           
              immediately result when this laboratory form replaces the                      
              conventional form.
