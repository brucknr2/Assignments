Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Over a 28-month period 9 Chicago metropolitan area high                        
              school mathematics teachers at three "hub" high schools and                    
              Elmhurst college faculty will assist 60 faculty and their                      
              administrators in nine participating high schools in the                       
              application of technology to the mathematics classroom                         
              through the use of an ongoing mentor program.  Each of pair                    
              of mentor teachers will work with faculty at three                             
              participant schools for a two-year period.  The focus of the                   
              project is on trying technology and technological skills to                    
              the NCTM Standards, local textbooks, national curriculum                       
              projects, and specific district curricula.                                     
                                                                                             
              The program involves: 1) spring and summer workshops for                       
              mentor teachers and participant faculty; 2) continuing in-                     
              service and on-site visitations by the mentor teachers; 3)                     
              adaptation of new classroom materials and exploration and                      
              development of teaching strategies that take into account                      
              local faculty expertise, hardware/software, course                             
              offerings, current texts, and curriculum emphasis; and 4)                      
              the establishment of a resource center/library of                              
              technology-oriented teaching materials at Elmhurst College                     
              for the hub, participant, and other area schools' faculty.
