Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Coalition of Essential Schools (CES) in co-operation                       
              with Brown University proposes an interdisciplinary training                   
              program for 96 Secondary Mathematics and Science fellows                       
              over 4 years.                                                                  
              The 4 years will be divided into three 2 year cycles with 32                   
              teachers in each cycle.  In the first year each teacher will                   
              upgrade his/her content knowledge and pedagogical                              
              techniques.  The teachers will attend, in the Spring, a one                    
              week orientation meeting to create working teams each to                       
              consist of eight science teachers and eight math teachers                      
              (designated as Fellows), one National Re:  Learning Faculty                    
              member and to college faculty (one science, one                                
              mathematics).  These teams will work together throughout the                   
              orientation and the Summer institute.  During the                              
              orientation a detailed Summer program schedule will be                         
              developed based on the specific needs of the Fellows.  An                      
              introduction will include the use of electronic mail                           
              networks and computer skills.  In the four week summer                         
              institute the Fellows will formulate essential questions,                      
              participate in experiments:  design, hands-on                                  
              laboratory/field work, data collection and analysis and                        
              problem solving and developing pedagogical skills in                           
              investigative style classes.  In the second year the Fellows                   
              will attend a spring orientation to assess the progress of                     
              implementation of math/science investigations in each school                   
              to develop additional essential questions and investigations                   
              and to identify pedagogical issues for examination during                      
              that summer.  They will also receive extensive training in                     
              classroom observation and debriefing techniques and learn                      
              skills of consultation and conflict resolution.  At the end                    
              of the project 96 math/science colleagues (each fellow                         
              mentoring 4 teachers).  The fellows will also work as                          
              consultants in some 200 other essential schools located in                     
              states across the nation.  Cost sharing is 13%.
