Abstract    :
              Spatial visualization is known to be a valuable and often                      
              essential skill for engineers in all of the disciplines. The                   
              purpose of this project is to design a three credit course in                  
              three-dimensional spatial visualization and to develop the                     
              necessary materials from which the course can be taught.  These                
              materials will include a written textbook and a laboratory                     
              manual.  The laboratory exercises will involve sketching and                   
              computer graphics and will also utilize the visualization                      
              capabilities of IDEAS software.                                                
              Freshmen engineering students with weak 3-D visualization                      
              skills  are the target audience for this course.  Women have                   
              been found to be approximately three times less likely than men                
              to have well-developed spatial visualization skills. Thus, it                  
              is expected that the proposed course will increase the                         
              accessibility of engineering studies to women. The goal of this                
              course is to provide the prerequisite spatial visualization                    
              skills needed by students to succeed in their subsequent                       
              engineering design graphics courses and in their later study                   
              and work.
