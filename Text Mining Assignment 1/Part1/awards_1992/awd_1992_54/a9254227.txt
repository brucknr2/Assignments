Abstract    :
              This project redesigns the laboratory curriculum of physical                   
              anthropology courses. The courses involve a two-semester                       
              sequence and core curriculum, which actively engage students in                
              the learning process using problem-oriented class exercises.                   
              These exercises are also used to integrate the laboratory with                 
              the lectures, as well as help standardize materials presented                  
              in different sections of the courses. The program is primarily                 
              offered to freshman and sophomore non-science majors, and teams                
              of experienced undergraduates and graduates are used to help                   
              enhance students' learning skills.
