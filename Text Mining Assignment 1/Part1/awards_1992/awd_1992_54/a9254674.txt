Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Reading Rainbow is an eighty (80) part PBS children's series                   
              (15 of which are science programs) that entices children five                  
              to eight years old to read good books, thus addressing the                     
              national tragedy of more and more young Americans reading less                 
              and less.  The Emmy award winning series employs television to                 
              sell the joy of science and reading to young viewers.                          
                                                                                             
              This proposal seeks funding for five additional Reading                        
              Rainbow programs which will focus on scientific themes.  These                 
              programs will be added to the previously funded science                        
              programs (22) to become part of the on-going series in                         
              demonstrating to children how science is integrated into all                   
              aspects of our lives.                                                          
                                                                                             
              The Reading Rainbow series premiered in the summer of l983 to                  
              phenomenal critical and popular acclaim.  In the fall of 1990,                 
              Reading Rainbow expanded ta a year round, daily schedule--                     
              after having spent seven years as a summer series.  According                  
              to formal studies, the science shows are of great interest to                  
              children and pique children's interest in related science                      
              topics and books.  The series is no in its tenth season and                    
              its popularity has grown among young viewers as well as with                   
              parents.
