Abstract    :
              The objectives of this proposal is to initiate the first part                  
              of an overall project to develop an action agenda to foster                    
              national implementation of the principal vision of the recent                  
              Presidential Young Investigator (PYI) Colloquium report,                       
              America's Academic Future.  An action agenda for 2010 will be                  
              developed through two, inter-related efforts. First, a series                  
              of five inter-connected colloquia, and data gathering                          
              activities, will be held that focus on developing specific                     
              strategies, models, and mechanisms to (a) recognize co-equally                 
              the instructional scholarship, public service, and research                    
              excellence of engineering, mathematics, and science faculty,                   
              and (b) increase substantially resources for instructional                     
              innovation and curriculum renewal, especially for undergraduate                
              instruction.  Second, (a) a network will be developed among the                
              past and present PYIs, and future NSF Young Investigators and                  
              Presidential Faculty Fellows, who are committed to providing a                 
              high-quality education for all students and increased career                   
              participation in engineering, mathematics, and science by all                  
              segments of society, and (b) an ethnographic study will be                     
              conducted of the PYI population to assess its current future                   
              impact on higher education and to gain insights useful for                     
              future NSF programming.
