Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The American Association for the Advancement of                                
              Science (AAAS) is publishing and disseminating                                 
              two booklets, Find Your Future and You're in                                   
              Charge, for precollege and undergraduate students                              
              with disabilities to motivate them towards education                           
              and careers in science and engineering.  The                                   
              booklets include a rationale for choosing a science-                           
              based career and encouragement to seek out                                     
              postsecondary institutions that offer science and                              
              engineering curricula.  The booklets include much                              
              practical advice on admissions, orientation,                                   
              establishing support services, interaction with                                
              faculty, asssistive technology, and pre-career science                         
              work experiences.                                                              
                                                                                             
              The booklets were developed in 1987-89 as part of                              
              an NSF-funded research project conducted by                                    
              American Institutes of Research (AIR) and AAAS                                 
              on critical factors contributing to entry and                                  
              advancement by persons with disabilities in science,                           
              mathematics, and engineering fields.  In the course                            
              of the study, 280 working scientists and engineers                             
              and students with disabilities were interviewed.  The                          
              content of the booklets was developed from these                               
              interviews.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              AAAS will design and publish the booklets in an                                
              attractive format and will do some editing so that                             
              the legislative information and language meet 1992                             
              standards.  Announcements about the availability of                            
              the booklets will be placed in both the science                                
              education and disability press and announced in                                
              electronic networks.  Single copies will be                                    
              distributed with a cover letter/return sheet to obtain                         
              feedback.  Multiple copies will be distributed at                              
              appropriate meetings.
