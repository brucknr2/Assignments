Abstract    :
              The "non-majors" biology laboratory course has been                            
              substantially revised at Baylor University to include                          
              activities shown by recent research to be effective. Methods                   
              including cooperative learning, inquiry-based instruction, and                 
              emphasis on critical thinking and writing have been successful,                
              but problems remain.  Interdisciplinary studies, expanded                      
              biology experiences, training of teaching assistants, feedback                 
              on writing assignments, sensitivity to ethnic and gender                       
              differences in learning styles, and structure of the teaching                  
              laboratory are all topics that have been identified for further                
              study and improvement. The National Science Foundation grant                   
              will support interdisciplinary workgroups to address these                     
              problems and to recruit and support exceptional science                        
              graduate students who are interested in teaching.  Baylor has                  
              committed funds for renovation of the laboratory, and a                        
              separate grant or corporate partnership will be solicited to                   
              improve technology.  This innovative curriculum for                            
              undergraduate bioliteracy instruction and an intensive program                 
              for training of teaching assistants will serve as models for                   
              introductory biology education at comprehensive research                       
              universities and colleges.
