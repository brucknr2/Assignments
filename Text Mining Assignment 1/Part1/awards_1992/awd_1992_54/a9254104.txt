Abstract    :
              A new course, Environmental Studies (ENS) 110, Methods in                      
              Environmental Science, is being offered to freshmen and                        
              sophomores of all majors at Alfred University.  The primary                    
              emphasis of the course is on introducing students to how                       
              science is performed by supervising their research as class                    
              projects in ozone monitoring, geotechnical evaluation , and                    
              evaluation of discharge and pollution of surface and ground                    
              waters. Upper level students in Environmental Studies are used                 
              as mentors in the class to encourage and prepare them for                      
              future teaching careers.  A graduate student in education also                 
              assists and receives instruction while practicing teaching in                  
              science.  The course is specifically designed to overcome many                 
              contemporary criticisms of science education by assuring that                  
              students are introduced to science as a process. Students are                  
              required to  design, conduct, analyze, and present results of                  
              their own experiments and field work. They learn cooperatively                 
              by working in groups. Emphasis is also placed on quantitative                  
              skills by integrating the use of mathematics and computers into                
              science.
