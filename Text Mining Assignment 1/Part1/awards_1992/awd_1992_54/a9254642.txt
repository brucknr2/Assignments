Abstract    :
              9254642  Barrett    The Lawrence Hall of Science and the University of Texas at 
              Austin's Marine Science Institute are collaborating on a marine  science
              teacher enhancement program that will serve 912 K-8  teachers in exemplary
              methods of science and math instruction and  provide 17,600 students and their
              teachers in California and  Texas with increased knowledge of ocean ecosystems.
               This model  that is specifically designed to make science instruction 
              accessible to language minority students, will be implemented in  four urban
              school districts, two in California and two in Texas.  In years 1 and 2,
              leadership teams from eight California schools  and six Texas schools will
              attend summer institutes that  introduce teachers to marine science education
              integrated with  mathematics and other areas of science.  The teachers will
              also  have assistance as they plan for the improvement of the total  science
              program of their buildings.  During the school year, the  lead teachers will
              assist the MARE staff in conducting whole-  faculty inservice sessions to share
              the program and the teaching  strategies with their colleagues.  They will also
              lead faculty  planning sessions for the whole-school Ocean Week immersion event
               that is the high point of the year-long marine science program at  each site. 
              During Year 3, the district leadership teams will  adopt eight new schools in
              California and six new schools in  Texas.    The cost sharing will be 35% of
              the NSF award.  ***
