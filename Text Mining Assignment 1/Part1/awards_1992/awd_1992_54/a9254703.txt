Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The Smithsonian Institution's Office of Environmental                     
              Awareness, National Museum of Natural History, and Traveling                   
              Exhibition Service are developing a major traveling                            
              exhibition, Ocean Planet, that will heighten public awareness                  
              of the need for ocean conservation.  Ocean Planet will show                    
              how our lives are connected to the seas, illustrate the                        
              rapidly mounting problems threatening coastlines and open                      
              oceans, and feature promising efforts to manage oceans and                     
              oceanic resources in a sustainable manner.  The exhibition and                 
              its accompanying programs will introduce the American public                   
              to the science underlying ocean conservation, including the                    
              fields of biogeochemistry, economics, fisheries biology,                       
              geology, marine anthropology, marine biology, and                              
              oceanography.  Evaluation studies conducted before, during,                    
              and after exhibition development will help make the exhibition                 
              and programs more responsive to its audience.  Following a                     
              six-month showing in the National Museum of Natural History,                   
              and modifications based on visitor studies, Ocean Planet will                  
              visit eight American cities, introducing millions of museum,                   
              aquarium, and science center visitors to environmental issues                  
              affecting oceans.  The exhibition will be accompanied by an                    
              extensive program of  educational materials and activities                     
              outside of the host site.  A program of education grants to                    
              the venues on the national tour will encourage collaboration                   
              with local educational institutions and community groups.                      
                                                                                             
                   We request $951,050 from the National Science                             
              Foundation's Informal Science Education Program to Support                     
              exhibition research, designs, evaluation, fabrication, and the                 
              development of accompanying educational materials.  The                        
              additional $3,000,000 needed complete the project will be                      
              raised from corporate sources, private foundations, and the                    
              Smithsonian Institution.
