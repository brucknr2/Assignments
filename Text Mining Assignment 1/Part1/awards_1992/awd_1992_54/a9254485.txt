              MA    Mathematical Inquiry Video Tapes: Tools for Professional Growth    This
              is a 3-year project to develop and disseminate some 10 20-  minute video tapes
              for use in pre- and in-service programs for  middle school mathematics
              teachers.  The tapes deal with problems  that arise when teachers try to
              introduce inquiry-based learning  into their classrooms, and focus on: (1) the
              use of technology as  an effective tool for supporting student investigations;
              and (2)  the role of the teacher in facilitating student conversations about 
              mathematics.  Each tape highlights a particular issue, like:  characteristics
              of inquiry-oriented tasks; management of pair- and  small-group work; when to
              intervene? etc.  The tapes are as  "unstaged" as possible--featuring real
              teachers with real students  in real classrooms.  They are based on pieces of
              curriculum that  PIs of major curriculum projects have identified as being 
              particularly suited for illustrating various aspects of inquiry  learning.  In
              addition to the classroom footage, each tape also  shows teachers reflecting on
              the issues illustrated on the tape.   The tapes are to be pilot-tested in a
              variety of settings,  including television broadcasts to teachers, regional
              summer  workshops, school-site workshops, etc.  A national Advisory Board,  as
              well as an outside evaluator, monitor the development of the  tapes throughout
              the various stages of development--from initial  script outlines to raw video
              footage to pilot-testing and on to the  final edited product.  The completed
              packets--consisting of a video  tape and appropriate accompanying print
              material--will be made  available to NSF-funded teacher enhancement projects,
              and to others  via EdCo (a consortium of greater Boston school districts)),
              MCET  (the Massachusetts Educational Telecommunication Network, and a  private
              publisher.    Cost  sharing is $121,600, which is 11% of the total NSF 
              contribution.
