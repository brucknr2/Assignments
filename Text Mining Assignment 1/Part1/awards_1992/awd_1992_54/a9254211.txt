Abstract    :
              The project is developing new laboratory exercises for non-                    
              science majors in introductory geology courses.  Each exercise                 
              is divided into a 1) data acquisition 2) data analysis and 3)                  
              model visualization/testing phase.  RISC-based graphics work                   
              stations, electronic measuring devices and  field tests are                    
              being used to bring 3-D visualizations into the elementary                     
              course sequence.  With the introduction of computer analysis of                
              data and with computer modelling of geologic processes, non-                   
              science students are developing scientific methods and learning                
              about critical environmental problems.  Although these                         
              approaches are being developed for classes with large                          
              enrollments, the laboratory portion of the course involves 20-                 
              25 students in each section, requires individual participation                 
              and introduces the use of computer visualization models to                     
              evaluate each simple hypothesis.
