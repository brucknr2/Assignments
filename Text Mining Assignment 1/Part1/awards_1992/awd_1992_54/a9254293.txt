Abstract    :
              This is a joint project of the New Jersey Institute of                         
              Technology as lead institution for the North/Central New Jersey                
              and Camden County College as lead institution for the Southern                 
              New Jersey CIM Consortia.  The consortia operate fully                         
              articulated programs aimed at the AAS and BSET degrees in                      
              Manufacturing Engineering Technology.  The consortia consists                  
              of 13 community colleges and NJIT in the North/Central; Camden                 
              County College, 5 other community colleges and NJIT in the                     
              Southern.                                                                      
              Articulated curricula of the two consortia include a two course                
              sequence in Manufacturing Systems.  This sequence is critical                  
              to the success of the program.  Significant deviations in                      
              course content and emphasis among the member colleges have been                
              noted.                                                                         
              This project will solicit input from the manufacturing industry                
              on required skills which should be attained through the first                  
              course of the two-course sequence.  During a summer Curriculum                 
              Development Institute, selected faculty members will develop                   
              model curricula and training modules.  The project will also                   
              identify possibilities for sharing of laboratory resources in                  
              support of the model.
