Abstract    :
              This project is developing a new introductory statistics                       
              curriculum for science, engineering, and management students at                
              WPI that can serve as a model for such curricula nationwide.                   
              Focusing on the two goals of teaching students to think                        
              critically about data and having them experience the role of                   
              statistics in scientific investigation, the curriculum has                     
              among its key features:  division of the material into one-week                
              modules, each based on a laboratory and project experience; a                  
              complete restructuring of course content emphasizing                           
              exploratory, graphical, and computational approaches to data                   
              analysis and inference; and the incorporation of new teaching                  
              strategies.  The modular course structure allows flexibility in                
              customizing the course to student and instructor needs, and                    
              ensures portability to other institutions.  The labs and                       
              projects provide students with hands-on experience in using                    
              statistical methods in scientific experimentation, data                        
              production, and data analysis.
