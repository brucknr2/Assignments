Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to create an interdisciplinary course in                    
              geometry and design.  The primary objective of the project is to               
              address a major challenge in mathematics education for                         
              undergraduates by creating a course, innovative in content and                 
              structure, that will demonstrate the links between artistic                    
              creativity and the logical processes of mathematics to art and                 
              design majors.  The course will use geometrical ideas as the                   
              organizing force which links scientific, artistic, and cultural                
              subject areas.                                                                 
              The course will expose students to new processes of reasoning and              
              make them aware of the possibilities that can arise through radical            
              thinking and risk taking; and it will bridge the apparent gap                  
              between the realm of art and design and that of mathematics.  The              
              process of awakening students to their creative potential by                   
              allowing them to work with unfamiliar reasoning processes will                 
              widen their horizons and give them skills in new areas.  Students              
              will have the opportunity to test out the effectiveness of the                 
              concepts they have developed and bear witness to the reaction of a             
              public-at-large to their experimental efforts.                                 
              The materials developed for this course will be tested at several              
              sites in courses for liberal arts majors as well as for students of            
              art and design.  An advisory board will also assist in evaluation              
              of the materials.
