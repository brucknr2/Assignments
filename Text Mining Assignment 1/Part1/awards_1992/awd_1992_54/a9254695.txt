Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  A three-year project, Science And Youth (SAY), integrates                 
              the existing curriculum, instructional design, and training                    
              capacity of the 4-H Science Experiences and Resources for                      
              Informal Educational Settings (SERIES) project with high                       
              school students exploring careers in teaching at eleven                        
              existing "teaching magnet" high schools across the country.                    
              The SAY project expands the quantity and quality of informal                   
              science education experiences by accomplishing the following                   
              objectives: 1) prepare one thousand teenage teachers/leaders                   
              to present SAY activities to forty thousand elementary school                  
              age youth: 2) involve participating youth in a total of five                   
              hundred community service projects; 3) involve five hundred                    
              teenage leaders in mentoring relationships with local                          
              scientists, and; 4) have seventy-five percent of the                           
              participants continue their education in science and/or the                    
              teaching profession.                                                           
                                                                                             
                   SAY uses a teens-as-leaders model to engage younger youth                 
              (ages 9-13) in hands-on, inquiry-based science activities that                 
              result in science-based community services projects.  SAY                      
              offers youngsters a vehicle for experiencing how science                       
              problem solving strategies are applied to home and community                   
              problems.  The pedagogy of the SAY project represents the best                 
              of current research on science education, and offers an                        
              innovative model for the preparation of a new cadre of science                 
              teachers.
