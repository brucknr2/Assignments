Abstract    :
              9254504  Comstock  Students, teachers, and researchers in the life sciences face
               significant and complex ethical problems.  Unfortunately, they  typically do
              not have formal training in ethical reflection.   This project will teach basic
              methods and principles in applied  ethics to life science faculty at two land
              grant universities,  and equip them to lead discussions of ethical issues in
              their  classrooms and labs.  The project will also challenge them to  reflect
              on various moral facets of their research.  The training  will occur during
              week-long summer institutes, "Ethics and  Agricultural Biotechnology."  A team
              of three philosophers,  including faculty at the institutions where the
              workshops will  occur, will lead the sessions.  Activities will consist of 
              lectures on moral theory, sessions on how to teach ethics to  science students,
              and debates on moral issues in science and  technology.  The institute will be
              held once a summer, for two  successive summers at two sites.  It will reach a
              total of 60  life scientists.  Most will be at the two host campuses:  
              University of Illinois at Urbana, and Michigan State University.   Several
              slots will be reserved for faculty at nearby  institutions, to promote broader
              outreach.  The project includes  preparatory activities and follow-up
              activities.  Faculty  participants will continue to meet twice a semester for
              three  years after the initial workshop, forming a critical mass of  scientists
              on each campus formally engaged in ongoing discussion  of ethical issues.  The
              newsletter "Ag Bioethics Forum" from Iowa  State University will devote an
              issue each year to the summer  programs.  ***
