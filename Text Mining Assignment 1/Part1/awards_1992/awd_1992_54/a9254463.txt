Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The project will develop culturally-relevant laboratory                        
              experiments for the middle school level which are tailored                     
              to the needs and interests of Pacific Northwest Tribes.                        
              Selected middle school teachers of Native Americans would be                   
              trained in the implementation of these materials in the                        
              classroom bringing 20 teachers to the University of                            
              Washington campus for each of two summers.  A follow-up                        
              program of in-service workshops will also be held during the                   
              academic year.  In addition the teachers will be in contact                    
              with each other and with the University of Washington                          
              faculty via an electronic network.  The laboratory materials                   
              will focus upon areas of tribal concerns such as                               
              fisheries/forestry, soil analysis, museum conservation, and                    
              rediscovery of artistic techniques.  The project will                          
              utilize the tribal leaders and others who are experts in the                   
              traditions of the Native American tribes to make sure that                     
              the materials developed will be appropriate for their                          
              culture.
