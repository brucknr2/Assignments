Abstract    :
              The AAAS's Project on Science Technology and Disability has                    
              developed and published four concise brochures as a series                     
              to serve as comprehensive accessibility guides for research                    
              directors, meeting conveners, department heads, and                            
              professors so that all aspects of their programs will be                       
              accessible to scientists, engineers, and students with                         
              disabilities.  The series includes the following:                              
              Barrier-Free:  Workshops and Conferences for Scientists and                    
              Engineers, Barrier-Free:  Laboratories and Classrooms in                       
              Science and Engineering, Barrier-Free:  Access to Science                      
              Literacy, and Barrier-Free:  Access in Word and Deed.                          
                                                                                             
              The existence of the series has been widely publicized and                     
              requests have exceeded expectations.  The original plan was                    
              to have the series available at AAAS and other scientific                      
              meetings but the AAAS has received requests for the series                     
              by mail daily.  They are no longer able to honor the requests                  
              without some financial support.  This project will provide                     
              funds for postage and secretarial assistance.                                  
                                                                                             
              The passage of the Americans With Disabilities Act has made                    
              the dissemination of the Barrier-Free series timely.  This                     
              project will aid in efforts to remove barriers which have,                     
              in the past, prevented scientists and students with                            
              disabilities to fully participate in scientific research and                   
              studies.
