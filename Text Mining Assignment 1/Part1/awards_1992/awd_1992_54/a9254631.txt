Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will train a substantial number of teachers of                    
              science, mathematics and social studies in systems thinking.                   
              In 36 months, approximately 100 teachers will learn to use                     
              modeling systems, including STELLA which is available for                      
              even low-end Macintosh computers, to represent and solve                       
              complex problems.  Twenty-two teachers will be the core team                   
              which accumulates develops and disseminates models related                     
              to mathematics, science, technology and society.                               
              Partnerships with local industry and agencies help by                          
              providing the ongoing support teachers need to develop                         
              relevant models.                                                               
                                                                                             
              Even though the project directly serves only teachers in                       
              Oregon, it includes other supports for teachers such as the                    
              information of a national user's group for educators,                          
              networking in a way which permits sharing models, and                          
              significant commercial involvement in providing useful real                    
              world models.  Through this project, teachers will begin                       
              building interdisciplinary applications for their courses.                     
              These models help students to understand and represent                         
              complex processes.  The grantee provides matching costs of                     
              22%.
