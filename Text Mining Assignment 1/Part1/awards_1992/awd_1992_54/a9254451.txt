Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              "Living in Water" is a hands-on instructional program in                       
              life science for upper elementary/middle school grades.                        
              Dr. Valerie Chase, a biologist and educator at the National                    
              Aquarium in Baltimore, developed this program with support                     
              from NSF's Instructional Materials Development Program.                        
              Teachers in the Chesapeake Bay region have been given access                   
              to training workshops for a number of years, and Dr. Chase                     
              now plans to offer training to teachers from across the                        
              country. Summer workshops would be offered at Towson State                     
              University for three years, providing training for 72                          
              "regional master teachers".  These workshop participants                       
              would learn to teach "Living in Water" in their own                            
              classrooms, and they would gain a deeper understanding of                      
              the biology, chemistry, and physics that underlie the                          
              activities in the curriculum. Each of these teachers would                     
              provide training to other teachers in their home region.                       
                                                                                             
              This national dissemination project would 1) train teachers                    
              as teacher-trainers for an NSF-supported curricular unit, 2)                   
              establish a national newsletter for users of the unit, 3)                      
              support an NSTA short course to introduce the unit to a wide                   
              audience, and 4) result in an update of the unit based on                      
              input from an Advisory Board and the expanded pool of users.                   
              "Living in Water" is a unique and high quality instructional                   
              program, and these teacher training activities will                            
              disseminate it to classrooms across the country.                               
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing represents 46% of the NSF contribution.
