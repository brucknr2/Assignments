              Institution: Poway Unified School District  Proposal Title:  Making Science
              Real    This project is interdisciplinary in nature and has been designed  by
              middle school teachers in the Poway Unified Schools, Poway,  California.  The
              goal of this project is to improve, broaden, and  deepen the scientific,
              pedagogical, and technological knowledge and  skills of the participating
              teachers and to enhance their ability  to teach all students more effectively. 
              It is a three year project  involving 48 Poway Schools sixth, seventh and
              eighth grade teachers  of science, mathematics, social science and language
              arts. The  objects are as follows:         o  to design 12 thematic curriculum
              units that integrate       state-of-the-art technologies as tools for learning
              that will       contribute to the acquisition of scientific literacy; and      
                o  to design a site-based staff development process model led       by
              teachers with a focus on teaching and learning strategies       and authentic
              ways to assess learning.         District-level directors are active
              participants in the  project.  Partnerships with local businesses and
              universities  provide resource support and bring content and process expertise
              to  the school sites.  Knowledge acquired from this project should  facilitate
              the successful implementation of science programs in  similar settings.
