Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Informal learning in math, science, and technology is an                       
              increasingly important vehicle for educating the public.                       
              Throughout their lifetime, the average citizen will spend                      
              a much greater amount of time in informal learning                             
              environments than in school.  For these efforts to                             
              continue without benefit of understanding, the dynamics                        
              of what makes informal learning experiences work, is a                         
              waste of valuable funding resources.  Research                                 
              Communications Ltd. (RCL) proposes an effort to                                
              investigate what has been learned about informal learning                      
              in math, science, and technology and to develop some                           
              directions for future research in this important area.                         
              The first step in the process would be to review the                           
              existing literature in the three primary areas of                              
              informal education for math, science, and technology:                          
              television/radio, community projects, and science museums                      
              and technology centers with a focus on evaluation studies                      
              that have shown what strategies have worked and those                          
              that have not.  The outcome of this effort would be a                          
              comprehensive publication of what is currently known                           
              about informal learning research in math, science and                          
              technology.
