Abstract    :
              Numerous reports have cited the deplorable state of scientific                 
              and mathematical illiteracy that exists within the U.S.                        
              Numerous approaches are being made to rectify this problem in                  
              grades K-12.  However, until students who have benefitted from                 
              these new approaches reach the university, something must be                   
              done to help today's university students.  This project is                     
              using the power of modern computers in the classroom to                        
              motivate, interest, and engage students who are taking a                       
              required business statistics course so that they can become                    
              more adept at quantitative reasoning and problem solving.  In                  
              order to reach this goal,  lesson modules are being developed                  
              that use quality color graphics, intensive computation, and                    
              multi-tasking to illustrate and demonstrate selected                           
              statistical concepts.  Each module consists of computer-based                  
              lecture materials, classroom exercises, instructor notes, and                  
              student experiments.  These lessons illustrate statistical                     
              concepts by integrating the computer into the classroom                        
              environment; involve students in problem solving by employing                  
              real, interesting, and relevant databases, statistical                         
              experiments and simulations; and illustrate situations where                   
              statistics can be used as an effective tool to understand and                  
              solve problems.  Potential impacts include improved student                    
              performance, an increase in students' abilities to use                         
              statistics to formulate and answer their own questions, and                    
              enhanced interest in quantitatively-oriented business careers.
