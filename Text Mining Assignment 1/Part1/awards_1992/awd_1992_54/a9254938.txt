Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This planning grant will lead to a proposal from the Science                   
              and Mathematics Learning Center at Chardon State College,                      
              representing the Northwest Nebraska Educational Consortium.                    
              The project works with teachers from every school in the                       
              districts, system administrators and college faculty to meet                   
              the inservice needs of the community.  The thirty-four                         
              members also participate on the strategic planning team.                       
              They also assume responsibility for doing a needs assessment                   
              in their respective buildings.                                                 
                                                                                             
              The final proposal will seek to "improve the leadership and                    
              pedagogical skills and science and mathematics knowledge                       
              base of all consortium teachers and empower the teachers, as                   
              professionals, to plan the curriculum changes."  Cost                          
              sharing is 166%.
