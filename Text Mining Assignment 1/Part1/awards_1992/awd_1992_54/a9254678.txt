Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Philadelphia Zoo proposes a design and evaluate a series                   
              of carry-along kits for families to use during Zoo visits and                  
              at home afterwards.  The materials and devices in the kits                     
              will help all members of the family strengthen their science                   
              process skills and upgrade their knowledge.  Evaluation will                   
              be a key part of the design process as materials are mocked up                 
              and tested, with results feeding directly back into the design                 
              process.  A design team will integrate scientists, educators,                  
              cognitive development researchers and designers who will  work                 
              collaboratively to develop the kits, drawing on the resources                  
              of a diverse advisory committee.
