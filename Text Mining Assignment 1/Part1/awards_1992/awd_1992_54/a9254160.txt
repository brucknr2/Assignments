Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to develop an undergraduate major                  
              in Information Technology that includes courses in                             
              telecommunications, information storage and organization,                      
              human-computer interaction, technology transfer, and computer                  
              programming.  The curriculum development efforts of fifteen                    
              faculty from the Information Technology and Computer Science                   
              departments will be coordinated by the three principal                         
              investigators.  Team members will participate in a workshop in                 
              summer 1993, work individually and in small groups throughout                  
              the year on construction and evaluation of course materials,                   
              and host a national workshop on undergraduate Information                      
              Technology in fall 1994.                                                       
              Already rich in information expertise, RIT intends to become a                 
              leader in this emerging field.  The results of our curriculum                  
              development efforts will be shared through professional                        
              meetings and publications.  We also hope to initiate a                         
              professional society in Information Technology so that                         
              curricular and technical developments can be disseminated                      
              nationally.
