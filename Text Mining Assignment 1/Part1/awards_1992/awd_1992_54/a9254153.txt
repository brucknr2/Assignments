Abstract    :
              The project will design an interdisciplinary laboratory science                
              course for non-science majors that explores the earth's past                   
              and its place in the universe.  The course will be based on                    
              concepts common to all of science. It will include elements of                 
              and be taught by faculty from cosmology, physics, chemistry,                   
              geology and the life sciences.  The centrally significant ideas                
              of these disciplines will provide the focus for presentations                  
              and laboratory experiences. Faculty members who will teach in                  
              this course will themselves become "master learners", attending                
              classes in other disciplines. There will be a 4-week workshop                  
              to design the course in 1993, a two-week workshop to review,                   
              evaluate and revise it in 1994, and a two-day evaluation                       
              session in May, 1994.  Upon completion of the grant, there will                
              be six to eight faculty prepared to teach this innovative                      
              interdisciplinary class.
