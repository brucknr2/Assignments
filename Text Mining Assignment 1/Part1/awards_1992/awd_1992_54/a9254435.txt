Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Franklin Institute Science Museum in Philadelphia, PA                      
              requests NSF support for a three-year model program entitled                   
              "Partnerships for Acheiving Careers in Technology and Science"                 
              (PACTS).  Building upon a successful pilot project involving                   
              African-American students and mentors, PACTS aims to foster                    
              positive attitudes about science careers and increase students                 
              leadership skills and self-estee.  Through bi-weekly hands-on                  
              science workshops with African-American Scientists as mentors,                 
              students will strengthen their understanding of science                        
              concepts and enhance their critical thinking skills.  On                       
              alternate Saturdays, students will participate in                              
              college/career workshops.  PACTS students will also have the                   
              opportunity to tutor younger students, visit science                           
              laboratories, and serve as science museum demonstrators.                       
              Additional support and encouragment will be provided through                   
              a network of community resources involving partnerships among                  
              scientists, professional associations, community centers,                      
              corporations and a science center.  The PACTS model will be                    
              disseminated nationally through museum conferences, the                        
              national networks of professional associations and                             
              corporations, and presentations by PACTS staff to interested                   
              organizations in other cities.
