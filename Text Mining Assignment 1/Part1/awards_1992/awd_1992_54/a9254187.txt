Abstract    :
              This project is aimed at strengthening and modernizing academic                
              preparation in Electrical and Computer Engineering Technology.                 
              Employers have increased academic hiring requirements                          
              commensurate with revolutionary developments and growth of                     
              emerging computer related technology.  Minorities who are                      
              expected to account for a growing percentage of the workforce                  
              are grossly underrepresented in technical occupations.  This                   
              exemplar project employs a comprehensive strategy to improve                   
              student mastery of engineering technology, heighten student                    
              academic participation and achievement, emulate an industrial                  
              workplace environment, and enhance academic and employment                     
              opportunities.  Activities in two fundamentals laboratories                    
              will be restructured to foster improvements in the mastery of                  
              laboratory skills.  Project activities include the design and                  
              development of online instructional resources on the                           
              departments' local area network, computer based data                           
              acquisition and analyses, and multimedia courseware for                        
              presentations and lectures.  Also included in the activities is                
              an extensive evaluation component and a national and regional                  
              program for dissemination of project methodologies and results.
