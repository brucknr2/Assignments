Abstract    :
              Initial work is being conducted toward the goal of                             
              instituting a Mathematics Across the Curriculum program to                     
              affect all students at the University of Nevada, Reno by                       
              facilitating the use of mathematics in all core curriculum                     
              classes.  A total of 16 faculty from a variety of disciplines                  
              as well as mathematics are engaged in determining specific                     
              places where mathematics can be introduced into the                            
              curriculum of core courses. After the original development,                    
              these approaches are being added to the courses. In addition,                  
              student Math Mentors are being trained and employed to assist                  
              faculty and students in the effective application of                           
              mathematics in non-mathematics courses. Matching support is                    
              being provided through a Hughes Foundation grant to support                    
              the salary of a director of a Mathematics Center. The long                     
              term goal is to translate success with a similarly-focused                     
              Writing Center into a Center devoted to promoting Mathematics                  
              Across the Curriculum.
