Abstract    :
              The introductory curriculum in computer Science is placing an                  
              increasing emphasis on the science of the discipline itself.                   
              The student is presented with a broad (yet detailed) overview                  
              to the breadth of the discipline in a manner similar to that of                
              the other sciences (physics, chemistry, etc.).  This is a                      
              substantial change from the introductory curricula of old, in                  
              which the primary focus was the development of competent                       
              programmers, or software engineers.  It provides a proper                      
              perspective for the incoming student regarding the true nature                 
              of the discipline of computing.  Furthermore, it increases                     
              student interest and motivation, as actual research topics and                 
              applications can be addressed almost immediately in the                        
              student's studies.  Nevertheless, care must be taken to ensure                 
              that the students emerging from this sequence are skilled in                   
              the basic issues regarding software development.  A necessary                  
              by-product of this introductory sequence must also be the                      
              generation of competent software practitioners.  This proposal                 
              focuses on techniques that can be integrated into an existing                  
              computer science curriculum (that places its emphasis on the                   
              science of computing) to ensure the production of competent                    
              software developers.  In particular, emphasis is placed on the                 
              development of software engineers that can function in an                      
              environment of large-scale applications, where emphasis is                     
              placed on maintainability, re-use and reliability.
