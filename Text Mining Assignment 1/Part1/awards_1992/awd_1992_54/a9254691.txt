Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal requests support for an exhibition on Native                     
              cultures of Alaska and Siberia for travel to Native and non-                   
              Native communities in rural Alaska.  The exhibition consists                   
              of 200 small artifacts from Siberian and Alaskan                               
              archeological and ethnographic museum collections, archival                    
              photographs, Native craft and traditional arts, 20th century                   
              graphic arts, and videos.  Curriculum packets and                              
              educational materials and videos will be prepared for use in                   
              the exhibition venues.  These instructional materials,                         
              including an exhibit catalogue, will be designed to serve as                   
              "stand-alone" components as well.                                              
                                                                                             
              The Smithsonian Arctic Studies Center has selected                             
              "Crossroads of Continents *RFD Alaska" as a prototype                          
              project that will lead toward establishing standards for                       
              museum-based educational outreach programs for use in native                   
              communities in rural regions where professionally staffed                      
              museums usually do not exist.  This goal is especially                         
              challenging in Alaska, where distances are great, population                   
              centers are small, and there are unique problems of                            
              transportation, communication, security, and language to be                    
              overcome.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              The project is an ideal one in that much of the basic                          
              research for the exhibition has already been accomplished.                     
              What is needed now is to develop a Native education                            
              component and local initiatives to accompany the core                          
              exhibit, and to produce the exhibition and the exhibition                      
              catalogue.  Once developed, the experience of this project                     
              will serve to guide future programs not only in Alaska, but                    
              also throughout the Circumpolar North.
