Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of the Science Minders project is to increase the                     
              interest and self-esteem of girls relative to science.                         
              Since many early adolescents seek economic independency by                     
              "baby-sitting," the Science Minders project will develop                       
              materials designed to permit early adolescents to teach                        
              science to small groups of young children.  The materials                      
              will make the early adolescents' child-caring providing more                   
              successful and significantly enhance their attitudes and                       
              comfort with science.  These materials will include a book                     
              containing informal science activities and activity                            
              resources, a child-development guide, first-aid and                            
              emergency procedures and child-care tips; and two training                     
              videos, one to demonstrate how to use the materials                            
              effectively with young children, and one to train adults to                    
              train adolescents as child-care providers.  These materials                    
              will be nationally promoted and disseminated by a commercial                   
              publisher and through the national network of 400 YWCAs in                     
              4,000 locations throughout the United States.
