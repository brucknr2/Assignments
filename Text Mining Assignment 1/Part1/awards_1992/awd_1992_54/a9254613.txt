Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              CTW is approaching completion of the fifth and final season of                 
              new show production for Square One TV -- a daily PBS                           
              television series designed to promote interest in and                          
              enthusiasm for mathematics among eight- to twelve-year-olds,                   
              with special attention given to girls and minority children.                   
              Research has shown that Square One TV is educationally                         
              effective, and the series has received numerous awards, from                   
              both the educational and broadcasting communities.
