Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This grant funds training and support for teachers in the                      
              use of interactive texts in mathematics instruction.  The                      
              workshops are held during two consecutive summers at four of                   
              the six existing Interactive Mathematics Text Project                          
              centers.  They include ongoing seminars throughout the                         
              academic year.  This 24 month project introduces teachers in                   
              Towson (Maryland), Detroit, Los Angeles, and Houston to                        
              interactive texts so they can use them in their classrooms                     
              and begin authoring their own texts.  Monthly seminars                         
              during the school year support the classroom work of the                       
              teachers and provide a chance for them to share, consult                       
              with experts, and provide feedback to the PI.  In the second                   
              summer, the teachers work with texts continues as they learn                   
              additional authoring systems.                                                  
                                                                                             
              The technology and methodology used in this project are new                    
              to teachers.  The project provides insights and                                
              understandings into how readily teachers adapt this                            
              technology to their classrooms and how extensively teachers                    
              need to be trained to feel comfortable with it and value its                   
              use.                                                                           
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing is estimated at 73%
