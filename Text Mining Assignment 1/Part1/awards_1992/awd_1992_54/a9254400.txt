Abstract    :
                   This four year project, Enhancing the Success of Minorities in            
              Science and Engineering:  Outcome and Process Evaluation of the                
              Meyerhoff Program, investigates the effectiveness of the Meyerhoff             
              Program for talented Black students in science and engineering.                
              The program components are recruitment, Summer Bridge Program,                 
              scholarships, study groups, program values, program community,                 
              personal advising and counseling, tutoring, summer research                    
              internships, faculty and administrative involvement, mentors, and              
              family involvement.  The evaluation will determine which of the                
              program components and other key program factors provide the                   
              critical support needed to keep talented undergraduate Black                   
              students in science and mathematics.  Also, the evaluation will                
              identify what type of institutional support is needed for                      
              continuing and replicating an innovative intervention program.
