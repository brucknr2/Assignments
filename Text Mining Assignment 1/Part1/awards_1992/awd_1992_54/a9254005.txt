Abstract    :
              The proposed project will produce a series of eleven videotapes                
              for use in undergraduate instruction in introductory                           
              engineering thermodynamics.  The tapes will use a combination                  
              of live-action video to illustrate important applications of                   
              thermodynamics and computer-generated graphics to illustrate                   
              fundamental concepts.  Historical background on important                      
              people and events in the development of thermodynamics will                    
              also be presented.  Topics covered in the programs will include                
              energy, heat and work concepts, thermodynamic properties and                   
              processes in gases, liquids and mixtures, energy                               
              transformations and First Law analysis of closed and open                      
              systems, reversibility and irreversibility, Second law analysis                
              and entropy, isentropic processes and component efficiency,                    
              Carnot and thermodynamic cycle performance, and principles and                 
              applications of various power and refrigeration cycles.  The                   
              tapes will be used in several core thermodynamics courses at                   
              the University of Texas at Austin with a total enrollment of                   
              800 students annually.  They will also be made available for                   
              use in a pilot evaluation at five other universities, and                      
              subsequently will be distributed nationally on a low cost                      
              basis.  When used nationally, these materials could impact more                
              than 25,000 engineering students per year in introductory                      
              thermodynamics courses.
