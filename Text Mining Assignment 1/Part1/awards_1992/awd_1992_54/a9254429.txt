Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The American Indian Science and Engineering Society (AISES)                    
              and the Colorado Alliance for Science will collaborate in                      
              the implementation of this three-year project designed to                      
              address math/science needs of three Wisconsin and three                        
              Michigan school districts which have a large (90-100%)                         
              Native American population.  Collaboration between                             
              elementary and secondary teachers will be promoted; each                       
              local team will consist of three elementary teachers, a                        
              Native American teacher-aide, and one high school teacher.                     
              The project, which includes an annual three-week summer                        
              workshop, four inservices, a two-day Leadership Seminar, and                   
              classroom observations and visits, will address the stated                     
              and identified needs of teachers of Native American students                   
              as determined through several needs assessments conducted by                   
              AISES over the past six years; these include the need for                      
              hands-on strategies, increased content knowledge, more                         
              American Indian culture in teaching math/science, and more                     
              training in cooperative and discovery learning strategies.                     
                                                                                             
              This leadership proposal is appropriate for teacher                            
              enhancement because it is designed to enhance the science                      
              knowledge and teaching, and develop leadership skills of                       
              teams of teachers from particularly needy population.                          
                                                                                             
              Non-NSF cost-sharing is approximately 4% of the amount                         
              requested from NSF.
