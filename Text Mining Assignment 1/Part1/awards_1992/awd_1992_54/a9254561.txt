Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This planning grant will lead to a proposal from a coalition                   
              of four school districts in western Connecticut.  The full                     
              grant would establish a center entitled the Center for                         
              Direct Involvement with Primary Research and Social                            
              Responsibility (DIPR/SR).  This center would focus on                          
              inquiry and laboratory based activities and issues shared by                   
              science, technology and society.                                               
                                                                                             
              The planning grant will establish the planning committee,                      
              devise an administrative plan and a program of activities                      
              for the center, develop a proposal for the NSF, and evaluate                   
              the planning process.  The grantee provided matching costs                     
              of 100%.
