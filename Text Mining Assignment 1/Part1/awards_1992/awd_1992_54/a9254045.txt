Abstract    :
              This project provides a curriculum for introductory                            
              Anthropology, Archaeology, and Prehistory Courses  that                        
              emphasizes scientific procedures of analysis in five principal                 
              topical areas. These  topical areas include  primate and                       
              hominid evolution, methods in prehistory, technological                        
              evolution, and migration.  Within each topical area, the                       
              program also focuses on a series of teaching and learning tasks                
              such as modules and group, laboratory and field activities.  It                
              is expected that the students will enhance their knowledge of                  
              evolution and prehistory, as well as acquire skills in the                     
              scientific process, data collection, and evaluation.
