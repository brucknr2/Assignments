Abstract    :
              9254491  Kubota    The Washington Initiative in Science Education - Science
              Teacher  Enhancement Project (WISE-STEP) the pilot for a statewide, five- 
              institute, multi-district collaborative project that addresses a  pressing
              challenge- how to align professional development  experiences with a systemic
              change effort that reflects both  emerging research on teacher change and
              empowerment and research  on student learning.  The project proposes to improve
              science  education through the collaborative efforts of teachers, school  and
              district administrators, scientists, community  representatives, and university
              faculty.  Through a series of  summer institutes and academic year follow-up
              activities WISE-  STEP will: 1.  directly assist approximately 40 teachers to 
              expand their understanding and appreciation of science and to  become leaders
              in their buildings and districts; work with  approximately 20 schools in 2
              school districts to develop the  infrastructure needed to support quality
              science education in the  elementary grades; collaborate with institute
              participants and  school officials on the adoption of high-quality science
              programs  in their districts; and collaborate with other scientists,  teachers,
              and education faculty so that the institute model can  be expanded to the
              entire State of Washington.  ***
