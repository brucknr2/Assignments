Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Arkansas, Little Rock is requesting three                    
              years of support to build a self sustaining program to place                   
              secondary math/science teachers in research positions in                       
              university or industrial laboratories.  Arkansas/STRIVE has                    
              developed from a three year pilot program which was                            
              supported both by NSF funds through Oak Ridge Associated                       
              Universities (ORAU) and six Arkansas businesses and                            
              institutions.  the program will ultimately provide research                    
              experiences for at least 50 secondary math/science teachers                    
              per year.  The teachers will engage in research for 7 weeks.                   
              They will afterwards spend one week at a central site on                       
              curriculum development leading to a plan for improvement in                    
              the teacher's personal pedagogical activities and to                           
              contributions to the preparation of a Recommendation for                       
              Curriculum Change report in their respective area of Life                      
              Science, physical Science or Mathematics/Computer.  A                          
              minimum of five more meetings are scheduled during the                         
              academic year with each participant being responsible for                      
              mentoring 5 other teachers in their school/school district.                    
              One result of the program will be to infuse the research                       
              workshops, to create video, computer and other materials                       
              which will be made available to teachers throughout Arkansas                   
              and nationally.  Cost sharing is 94% of the funds requested.
