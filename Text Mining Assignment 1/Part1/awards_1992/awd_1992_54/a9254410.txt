Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project targets 42 schools in two school districts near                   
              the University of Alabama, Huntsville.  Each of the 42                         
              schools will have a leader/master teacher in grades K-1,                       
              grades 2-3, and grades 4-5 for a total of 126 leader/master                    
              teachers.  Participants will be selected on the basis of                       
              potential for leadership, dedication to science, willingness                   
              to help other teachers, and prior experience in teaching                       
              hands-on science.  The 2-year training plan includes 45 days                   
              of instruction per teacher from university science and                         
              education faculty.  The cadre of leader/master teachers will                   
              train all K-5 teachers in activity-inquiry teaching and join                   
              with the principal and school resource scientist in forming                    
              leadership teams to lead all elementary schools in                             
              implementing a curriculum using nationally developed and                       
              tested hands-on modules.  The two school districts are                         
              creating a materials management program to provide kits of                     
              STC or INSIGHTS materials for every classroom on a                             
              continuing basis.                                                              
                                                                                             
              This leadership proposal is appropriate for teacher                            
              enhancement because it is designed to enhance the science                      
              knowledge and teaching, and develop leadership skills and                      
              efforts of lead teachers of grades k-5, and because it is a                    
              systemic plan designed to improve science education in all                     
              elementary classrooms in the participating districts.                          
                                                                                             
              Non-NSF cost-sharing is approximately 47% of the amount                        
              requested from NSF.
