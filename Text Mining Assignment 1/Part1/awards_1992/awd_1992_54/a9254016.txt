Abstract    :
              An Instructor's Reference Manual will be prepared that will                    
              provide information necessary for the efficient adoption of our                
              Discovery Program.  This curriculum addresses the concern for                  
              teaching students content in the laboratory while still                        
              focusing on the process of discovery.  A four-course                           
              introductory sequence is founded on laboratory exercises in                    
              which the students work individually and cooperatively to                      
              discover for themselves many of the basic principles of modern                 
              chemistry.  The essence of the approach is to have students                    
              "Discover" the basic concepts by participating directly in the                 
              process that is chemistry.  Thirty discovery experiments have                  
              been integrated into the curriculum.  This project will produce                
              a manual that documents instructional methodologies that have                  
              been successful with a variety of different discovery exercises                
              drawn from the program, and that also includes an extensive                    
              information base for each of the discovery exercises.
