Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This four-year program of Pri-Math II is designed to                           
              transform the 1990-93 NSF-funded, school-based Pri-Math (I)                    
              project into a district-level leadership model to improve                      
              mathematics education in the primary (K-4) grades.  During                     
              its first two years, PriMath II will work with school                          
              systems to develop individual, long-range improvement plans.                   
              Ten participating teams will each include up to four (K-4)                     
              classroom teachers or specialists selected from Pri-Math I                     
              participants + a district-level administrative person.                         
              Those teams will in-turn select supporting teams to enroll                     
              in the second two years.  Thus 56 lead teachers and 33                         
              administratives will be involved directly to reach 1668                        
              teachers indirectly by peer teaching.  Project activities                      
              will occur in 4 settings during each of the 4 years: 4-week                    
              summer institutes, 8 school-year seminars, 4 school-year                       
              visits by the PD to participant classrooms, and among                          
              participants within their schools coaching peers plus                          
              conducting inservice to articulate/implement system-wide                       
              plans.  Mathematics content and pedagogy is integrated                         
              throughout, with summer mathematics content courses being                      
              Geometry/Spatial Sense, Functions & Proportionality, Number                    
              Systems & Number Sense, and Data Analysis.
