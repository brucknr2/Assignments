Abstract    :
              Developing a Science Course for Non-Scientists on the Chemistry                
              of Art                                                                         
              During the present year a lecture/laboratory course on the                     
              chemistry of art has been developed and taught to a class of 40                
              students at Brandeis.  This course - essentially a materials-                  
              science course on the fabrication, examination, conservation                   
              and authentication ar artifacts - is an effective and                          
              attractive way of teaching science to non-scientists. At                       
              present two factors limit the course at Brandeis and its                       
              adaptation elsewhere, the lack of a suitable text and the                      
              difficulty of obtaining the necessary scientific data in a                     
              suitable form for teaching (e.g. the scientific data for                       
              assessing the restoration of the Sistine Chapel ceiling).  The                 
              proposal has four components: (i) to develop a scientific text,                
              limited to relevant topics but treated nevertheless in some                    
              depth, (ii) to develop, as a pilot project, a teaching                         
              laserdisc holding all the scientific and conservation data                     
              needed to investigate a famous and problematic artwork The                     
              Feast of the Gods (we propose doing this in collaboration with                 
              the National Gallery of Art in Washington), (iii) the further                  
              development of the successful laboratory component of the                      
              course, by introducing chemical microscopy for pigment and                     
              fiber characterization, and (iv) the external evaluation of the                
              educational effectiveness of the materials developed, by means                 
              of formative evaluation. The primary focus of the proposal is                  
              to promote the chemistry of art as a successful and appealing                  
              science course for non-scientists; and this may be achieved                    
              through the ready availability of a text, of visual material                   
              stored on laserdisc and of laboratory experiments developed for                
              the purpose.***//
