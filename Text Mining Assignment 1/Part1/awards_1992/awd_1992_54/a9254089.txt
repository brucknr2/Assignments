Abstract    :
              The problem is to help the over 900 first and second-year                      
              students in the Introductory Biology and Cell Biology courses                  
              at the University of Wisconsin-River Falls develop the critical                
              thinking skills used by scientific investigators.  Hypermedia                  
              software to be developed enables introductory students to                      
              simulate actual experimental investigations in cell biology and                
              biotechnology, including patch clamp studies of ion channels in                
              cell membranes and the micromanipulation of transgenic embryos                 
              used to create animal models for AIDS research.  Students can                  
              generate data and make inferences from these data.  The                        
              simulations are planned to: (1) complement existing                            
              laboratories in Introductory Biology with experimental                         
              procedures that are otherwise not feasible in this course, (2)                 
              enrich and expand those Cell Biology laboratories which do give                
              students hands-on experience with at least some of the                         
              simulated procedures, (3) prepare students for the advanced                    
              Molecular Biology course which includes the actual manipulation                
              of embryos used in transgenic animal production, and (4) serve                 
              as a recruitment tool for the Biology major and also for the                   
              new interdisciplinary Biotechnology major at UW-River Falls.                   
              A controlled statistical study will evaluate the long-term                     
              impact of this project and results will be disseminated via                    
              workshops and presentations to educational organizations.
