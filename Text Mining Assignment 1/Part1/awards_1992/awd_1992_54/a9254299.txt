Abstract    :
              Economics teaches a way of thinking, including an ability to                   
              assess alternative choices in the face of constraints, that is                 
              fundamental to informed private and social choice.  Also, an                   
              effective introductory economics course should teach students                  
              how to think intelligently and independently about economic                    
              issues.  Accordingly, this project develops an introductory                    
              microeconomic course that focuses specifically on the economic                 
              decisions that individuals make over the course of their lives.                
              The course also integrates exercises on numeric and computer                   
              analysis by providing an active, hands-on learning environment;                
              and will significantly enhance students' economic literacy, and                
              appreciation for cultural diversity.
