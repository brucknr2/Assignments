Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              SciTech Clubs for Girls, a three year old program, aims to                     
              encourage continuing interest in science and mathematics                       
              among 9-14 year-old girls.  It gives them an experience in                     
              building a hands-on science exhibit for display at SciTech,                    
              a hands-on science center.                                                     
                                                                                             
              Based on recent research, this program strikes at four major                   
              forces that keep girls out of the pipeline to careers in                       
              mathematics and science.  Mentors by female professionals,                     
              the girls learn the safe use of tools, a principle for                         
              science, confidence in building things, and the pride of                       
              building and exhibit for use by tens of thousands of                           
              visitors yearly.                                                               
                                                                                             
              Recently SciTech received a $125,000 grant from Youth ALIVE|                   
              A National Initiative of the DeWitt Wallace-Reader's Digest                    
              Fund to continue the program for 3-years and to expand it.                     
              We will reach 20 clubs of girls each year from organizations                   
              that serve girls.  The program will reach older and younger                    
              girls and their female leaders.  We will also reach into the                   
              intercity of Chicago to serve more minority girls.  Under                      
              the YouthALIVE| grant we will carefully evaluate results and                   
              begin to disseminate the program to other museums                              
              nationally.
