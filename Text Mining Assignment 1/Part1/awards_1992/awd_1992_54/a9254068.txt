Abstract    :
              As the number of jobs in which shared rather than individual                   
              work continues to grow, we are being forced to re-examine the                  
              way people work.  This proposal suggests that in today's work-                 
              place, computer scientists must be adept at both technical as                  
              well as communication skills.  It also suggests that we, as                    
              educators, must be prepared to teach our students how to work                  
              in collaborative environments that improve programmer                          
              productivity.  Towards this end, we propose to use an existing                 
              computer-supported cooperative problem solving environment to                  
              teach undergraduate computer science students to elicit                        
              software requirements.  We believe that requirements                           
              elicitation and cooperative skills are highly interrelated and,                
              as such, can be taught more effectively through the use of a                   
              computer-supported cooperative environment.  By doing this, we                 
              will be able to expand the problem solving skills of our                       
              students and, thus, release into the computer science community                
              more effective programmers.  The environment will encourage                    
              cooperative work, and yet provide instructors with the ability                 
              to monitor individual as well as group performance.  Through                   
              this system, students will be able to learn requirements                       
              elicitation techniques and, at the same time, gain valuable                    
              experience in working together on large team projects.
