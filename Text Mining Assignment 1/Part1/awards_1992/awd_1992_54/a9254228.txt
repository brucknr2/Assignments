Abstract    :
              Computer Applications to Enhance Inquiry-Oriented Instruction                  
              in Biology                                                                     
              The general problem of scientific-technical literacy as well as                
              the enhancement of inquiry-oriented laboratory instruction in                  
              biology is addressed. Specific  goals are to increase                          
              scientific literacy, reasoning skills, and the number of                       
              students succeeding in introductory biology courses.  Also,                    
              these goals will be achieved by developing, evaluating and                     
              integrating into the curriculum a set of computer applications                 
              designed to reinforce biology concepts with laboratory                         
              activities.  Efforts will be focused on an introductory biology                
              course at a 2-year college that serves a nontraditional                        
              undergraduate population.  Student populations will include                    
              more women, Hispanics, Native Americans and older students. The                
              resultant inquiry-based model of laboratory instruction is also                
              expected to be used as a model for computer technology in bio-                 
              science education.***//
