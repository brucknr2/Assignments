Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This planning grant will lead to full proposals from the                       
              Alaska Pacific University for a Teacher Institute and                          
              Teacher Preparation.  The planning grant will bring together                   
              the advisory board, the teachers and the elders form the                       
              native villages and use them to help identify how science                      
              education can be relevant and linked to the native culture.                    
              Ongoing projects funded by private foundations have                            
              supported the universities work with native Americans.  This                   
              minority institution is uniquely well suited to address the                    
              needs of this population.                                                      
                                                                                             
              The Alaska Pacific University is cost sharing 94% of the                       
              project.
