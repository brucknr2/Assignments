Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three-year project develops 40 5th and 6th grade mentor                   
              teachers and 480 partner teachers from grades K-6 in                           
              prealgebra, geometry, and data analysis content with                           
              inquiry-based methodology and alternative assessments                          
              throughout.  In this California State University-                              
              Northridge/Los Angeles Unified School District partnership,                    
              special attention is given to skills in teaching minority                      
              and limited-English students who comprise the majority of                      
              the local population.  Participants experience residential                     
              institutes, workshops, midweek seminars, and teacher-leader                    
              inservice opportunities, using the "sandwich" model (NCTM,                     
              1990 Yearbook) of classroom trials between the workshops and                   
              followup sessions.
