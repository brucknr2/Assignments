Abstract    :
              This project develops an introductory-level undergraduate                      
              curriculum in anthropology for Historically Black Colleges and                 
              Universities (HBCUs).  The curriculum begins with a two                        
              semester sequence in cultural anthropology and research                        
              methodology followed by a summer ethnographic field school.                    
              The second year includes a sequence of one semester of language                
              and culture, a second semester of field research, and a summer                 
              internship.  A major focus of this project is the development                  
              of multimedia and interactive modules which will enhance                       
              students' understanding of basic anthropology, the research                    
              process, and cultural and social perspectives.  The proposed                   
              curriculum is also expected to increase the scientific and                     
              technical literacy of underrepresented minorities at other                     
              institutions.
