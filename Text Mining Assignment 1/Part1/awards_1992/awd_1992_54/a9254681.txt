Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              SOUNDPRINT, the weekly half-hour nationally broadcast public                   
              radio documentary series, proposes a 16-program SOUNDPRINT                     
              SCIENCE SERIES comprising four thematic components of four                     
              programs each, which explore and examine current issues and                    
              ideas in the areas of 1) Biodiversity and Species Management;                  
              2) Invasions:  The Predator and the Prey; 3) Cultural                          
              Geography; and 4) The Meanings of Science.                                     
                                                                                             
              The series offers listeners a variety of experiences                           
              illustrative of the breadth of what is defined as science.                     
              Scientific thought and method are presented through a                          
              humanistic storytelling approach that capitalizes on the                       
              imaginative quality of sound to immerse listeners in the                       
              exploration of phenomena.  Each documentary explores a single                  
              subject, placing it in a meaningful context, and taking                        
              listeners beyond the surface of simple fact reporting.                         
              Programs translate complex scientific ideas into accessible,                   
              memorable stories that increase awareness and understanding of                 
              science for a broad population (SOUNDPRINT REACHES OVER                        
              250,000 LISTENERS EACH WEEK).                                                  
                                                                                             
              The SOUNDPRINT SCIENCE SERIES will be broad cast as a series                   
              of quarterly, month-long specials, with promotional, education                 
              and community outreach materials provided to stations.  Post-                  
              broadcast application of the programs includes development of                  
              teacher guide packets targeted to the middle school level and                  
              repacking of programs for educational purposes in multi-media                  
              and interactive settings.  Cassette copies of programs are                     
              shared by listeners in professional, educational, and informal                 
              settings.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              Major scientific disciplines involved include: biology,                        
              environmental sciences, geography, life sciences, mathematics                  
              and physics.
