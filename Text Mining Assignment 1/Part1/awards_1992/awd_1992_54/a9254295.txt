Abstract    :
              Laboratory software modules, linked to a videodisc of still,                   
              motion, and animation sequences, will be used in a new                         
              undergraduate plant science lab. We will link the laboratory                   
              computers in a local area network so that groups of students                   
              can communicate with other groups (and with the teaching                       
              assistant) in order to work on open-ended, thought-provoking                   
              exercises in a cooperative, collaborative learning environment                 
              of scientific discourse and debate.  We further propose to test                
              the new and existing modules and exercises to assess the                       
              changes in the teaching/learning process that occur upon                       
              adoption of this new educational technology.                                   
              A core of 15 multimedia lab modules has been produced through                  
              collaboration of VPI Learning Research Center and the                          
              Department of Biology.  This core material lacks self-help                     
              tutorials to guide students through its complex new format,                    
              which shifts the traditional lab goal of demonstration to one                  
              of understanding causal relations and interconnectedness.  We                  
              use ecology and evolution as major themes to interpret plant                   
              construction, growth, and development, reproduction,and                        
              grouping.                                                                      
              With NSF support we will develop the self-help tutorials and                   
              cooperative learning exercises for the 15 core modules, produce                
              alternatives for several of them, implement the local area                     
              network, and design and implement assessment instruments to                    
              analyze our software modules and the changes in                                
              teaching/learning that this new educational technology brings                  
              to the life sciences.
