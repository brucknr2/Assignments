Abstract    :
              The Multicultural Mathematics Project (McMath) will develop an                 
              introductory, general education course in geometry.  The course                
              will use architecture--particularly the architectural                          
              constructions of the dwelling places of various cultural and                   
              social groups--as a vehicle to link the discipline of                          
              mathematics with the disciplines of physics, engineering, urban                
              geography, and anthropology.  The course will foster                           
              multicultural understanding in its exploration of the cultural                 
              embeddedness of mathematics as reflected in the dwelling places                
              of diverse groups of people.  Instructors will employ multiple                 
              teaching strategies as a response to diverse ways of knowing,                  
              in order to encourage the academic achievement of all students,                
              both those who have had prior success in mathematics and those                 
              who have not.  Course materials will be piloted and will be                    
              evaluated both by the development team and by an outside                       
              evaluator.
