Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The California Earth Science Academy (CESA) will provide a                     
              comprehensive training program in earth science concepts                       
              (60% geology, 15% astronomy, 15% meteorology, 10%                              
              oceanography) and instructional strategies for teachers of                     
              grades 4-12.  Four week summer workshops will enroll 36 and                    
              30 teachers as SJSU and CSU-San Bernardino respectively.                       
              Teachers will be selected from the counties around these two                   
              sites.  Graduate credits earned in the program are an                          
              integral part of an MA degree in Natural Science/Geoscience.                   
              Thirty teachers, selected from previous summer workshops                       
              will be Leader Teachers and subsequently offer workshops to                    
              peers far removed from any CSU campus.  The summer workshops                   
              emphasize earth science content and pedagogy along with                        
              field trips and hands-on activities.  Academic year follow-                    
              up includes short workshops, classroom support, field trips,                   
              and communications via CESA-NET.                                               
                                                                                             
              Leader Teachers will take an active role in the second                         
              summer's activities after participating in leadership                          
              activities the first summer.  The Leader Teachers will                         
              conduct workshops for their peers supported by CESA project                    
              mini-grants and LEAs.  The PI for the project is Dr. Ellen                     
              Metzger from SJSU.
