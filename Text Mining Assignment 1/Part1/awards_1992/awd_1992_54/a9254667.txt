Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This planing grant will lead to a proposal from Elizabeth                      
              State University representing schools in the northeastern                      
              region of North Carolina.  The PI has demonstrated that the                    
              students do not get an adequate education in mathematics                       
              creating an even greater problem since the state standards                     
              for college admission have been raised.  Through their                         
              summer work with students funded by the Department of                          
              Energy, the staff feels that when specific adjustments are                     
              made to provide support for the students, the students can                     
              and do learn mathematics.  With this grant, they will begin                    
              extending their work with the local school districts, assess                   
              the needs, and draft a formal proposal for funds to retrain                    
              the teachers in the region.                                                    
                                                                                             
              This proposal specifically addresses the needs of the                          
              African American students in the region and is administered                    
              by an HBCU.  It uses the community resources to support the                    
              development process and strives to involve parents in the                      
              homework with the students, learning along side of their                       
              children.
