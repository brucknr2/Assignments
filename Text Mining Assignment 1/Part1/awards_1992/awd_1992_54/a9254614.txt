Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The Brooklyn Children's Museum and the Brooklyn Botanic Garden            
              aim to cooperatively and cost-effectively develop, evaluate, and               
              produce three permanent exhibits (2600 sf at BCM, 1200 sf at BBG,              
              and a 3600 sf outdoor Discovery Garden at BBG) and two copies of an            
              800 sf traveling exhibit in a project called Breaking Ground:                  
              Plants and People.  When complete in 1996, these exhibits will                 
              teach 1.5 million annual public visitors about basics in botany,               
              ethnobotany, and urban to ecology, promote an understanding of                 
              plants' importance to human life, and foster positive environmental            
              ethics among children 6-12 years old.                                          
                                                                                             
                   This project is important because collaboration with                      
              professional botanists will teach a leading children's museum how              
              to effectively present in-depth science content, and allow a major             
              public garden to experiment with interactive exhibits in a natural             
              setting.  Joint promotions using NSF-funded program materials will             
              encourage children in culturally and economically diverse areas                
              around New York City to return again and again to two important                
              community resources for informal science education.  This strategy             
              will reinforce learning and promote lifelong appreciation for                  
              experiential exhibits in botanical gardens and for a meaningful                
              depth of science in children's museums.
