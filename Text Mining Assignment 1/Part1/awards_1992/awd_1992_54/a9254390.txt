Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This four-year project improves middle and secondary school                    
              physical science, biology, chemistry and earth science instruction             
              through training in microcomputer-based tools and modern                       
              pedagogies.  Forty-nine master teachers from eight geographical                
              areas in New York, Pennsylvania and Georgia are trained through two            
              four-week summer institutes.  The first institute emphasizes                   
              materials development, the second conducting workshops.                        
                                                                                             
              The teachers have access to previously developed materials and                 
              ongoing curriculum development efforts supported during the                    
              summers.  The teacher leaders, in turn, conduct area workshops for             
              400 additional teachers.  they support and train between six and               
              ten teachers in their area for each of the two years.  Moreover,               
              they are available to offer ongoing assistance to the teachers.                
              Matching funds of 35% are provided by the grantee.
