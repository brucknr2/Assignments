Abstract    :
              The project continues efforts to include polymeric materials                   
              topics in the undergraduate chemistry core curriculum.                         
              Instructional packets and laboratory experiments will be                       
              prepared for use by college and university faculty who have                    
              little or no prior experience in the polymer area.  The project                
              utilizes and extends the organization and infrastructure                       
              developed in a related earlier grant.  The three regional sites                
              established in the earlier grant (Rennselear Polytechnic                       
              Institute, the University of Southern Mississippi, and the                     
              University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point) again will host the NSF-                
              POLYED Scholars who are developing polymer curricular materials                
              during summer residencies at these sites.  In addition,                        
              instructional videotapes will be prepared at the University of                 
              Wisconsin-Stevens Point.  Regional workshops will be offered at                
              the three regional sites to begin dissemination of the                         
              curricular materials developed. The effort also will move                      
              beyond general chemistry to include the preparation of polymer                 
              curricular materials for the organic sequence.  The materials                  
              will be field tested and then disseminated widely through the                  
              proposed workshops, through publications, and from the POLYED                  
              National Information Center for Polymer Education.
