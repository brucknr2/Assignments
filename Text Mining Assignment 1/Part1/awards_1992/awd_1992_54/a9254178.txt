Abstract    :
              Lehman College plans to address the problem of poor student                    
              preparation and the alienation of incoming students from                       
              mathematics and science by converting, as a model, one section                 
              of 45 to 50 students in the present core sequence required of                  
              incoming students (quantitative reasoning and natural sciences)                
              to a two-semester combined mathematics-science course based on                 
              the inquiry-discovery method. A series of laboratory                           
              experiences will be developed in which the students are given                  
              tasks requiring higher-level thinking, but are not given                       
              explicit directions as to how to do them. The method requires                  
              the students to work in small groups with a tutor. The tutors                  
              will be science education students taking a specially-designed                 
              advanced education course in which they will learn the                         
              scientific concepts and develop  experience with the                           
              inquiry/discovery method of learning.
