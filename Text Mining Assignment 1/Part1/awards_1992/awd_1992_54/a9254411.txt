Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three year project will take exemplary curriculum                         
              materials in economics and incorporate them into a CD-ROM                      
              format.  This will provide teachers with an extensive                          
              library of economic materials through an interactive                           
              software system.  The project will be disseminated through                     
              the National Council on Economic Education.  Following the                     
              preparation of the CD-ROM materials teachers from every                        
              state will be involved in teacher enhancement programs to                      
              implement the curriculum in the schools.
