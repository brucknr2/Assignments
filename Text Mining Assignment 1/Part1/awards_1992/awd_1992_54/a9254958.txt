Abstract    :
              9254958  Meyer       The central issue of this proposed research is to try to 
              measure change in Gross National (or Domestic) Product in a number  of
              "developed" nations in the post-World-War-III period in relation  to changes in
              emphasis in national education systems with regard to  science and mathematics.
                    The nature of change on the independent variable side -- SEM  education
              -- is largely at the level and "density" of the intended  curriculum: i.e.,
              alterations in the number of science and math  courses and specifics content
              coverage (e.g., related to technology  or new fields of science).  Measures of
              pedagogy, broad attitude  toward school science, nature of testing, and other
              possible  significant changes are not involved.       The methodology involved
              consists, on the independent variable  side, of close analysis of educational
              documents and policies  (course descriptions, curriculum frameworks, teaching
              materials,  and the like) nation by nation, together with scaling or clustering
               of this material.  On the dependent variable side, the measures are  largely
              those of macroeconomic estimates of GNP growth over  particular periods of
              time, using a kind of segmented or  interrupted time series approach,, which
              amounts to a sort of  pseudo-panel approach.  That is, relatively brief periods
              of half  a decade or a decade are looked at over the entire span of 30 or  more
              years, with each nation's data forming its own series but with  comparisons
              possible across nations during particular periods.
