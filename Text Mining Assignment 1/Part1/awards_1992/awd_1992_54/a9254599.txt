Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This 3 week program is for 20 high school teachers per year                    
              for 2 years who will be drawn from all counties within                         
              Maryland and Baltimore City.  The complete program                             
              integrates math and science with engineering design using                      
              both hands on experiments and video tapes.  Participants                       
              will be provided with ready to use modules and laboratory                      
              kits that integrate engineering with mathematical and                          
              scientific concepts.  Field trips to NASA and NIST are                         
              included.  During the academic year follow up the teachers                     
              will meet together to discuss classroom applications, EMTI                     
              faculty will visit schools and maintain contact with                           
              participants.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              EMTI and the NSF young scholars program will be run                            
              simultaneously affording unique opportunities for shared                       
              learning and interaction between teachers, students and
