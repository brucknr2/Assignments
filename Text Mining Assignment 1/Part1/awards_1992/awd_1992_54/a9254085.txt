Abstract    :
              Materials are being developed for an innovative course in                      
              mathematical applications as a modern replacement for existing                 
              precalculus and related courses.  The course is an introduction                
              to mathematical models at the precalculus level and provides                   
              students with the skills and knowledge needed for calculus.                    
              The models developed in the course are primarily based on                      
              discrete mathematical topics such as difference equations, data                
              analysis, probability, and matrix algebra.  The course involves                
              computer and/or graphing calculator work to investigate most of                
              the mathematical models.  It also involves a variety of live                   
              classroom experiments to investigate how well the mathematical                 
              models reflect actual processes or to help develop mathematical                
              models based on observed experimental data.  The course                        
              features a series of student investigations to provide a real-                 
              life dimension.  It is designed to provide students with the                   
              motivation and impetus to continue on in mathematically related                
              fields by exposing them to the wide applicability of                           
              mathematics.
