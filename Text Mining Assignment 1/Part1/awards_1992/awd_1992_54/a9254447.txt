Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project proposes to provide leadership institutes for                     
              148 middle school teachers on global environmental change                      
              issues through a network of sea grant institutions in                          
              Oregon, Washington, Alaska and Hawaii.  The institutes will                    
              concentrate on the transfer of results of research to middle                   
              school teachers concerning global issues (global climatic                      
              change, ozone depletion, marine and etuarine pollution,                        
              decline in biodiversity, and over population).  The project                    
              is strongly supported by each of the 4 states' departments                     
              of education identified above.
