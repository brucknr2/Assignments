Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award provides support for Mr. Kamen to explore the                       
              feasibility of developing an interactive educational kiosk (to                 
              be named FIRST PLACE), programmed with electronic mathematics                  
              and science games and placed in out-of-school area such as                     
              shopping malls to reach K-12 children.  Students would play                    
              the games and be rewards with coupons.  This multi-                            
              disciplinary project would expand students access to science                   
              and mathematics, the learning into the economy, and present                    
              learning as a leisure time activity.
