Abstract    :
              St. Lawrence University has recently begun a major initiative                  
              to improve its introductory science courses and enhance science                
              education for non-science majors.  This will be accomplished by                
              first introducing more science into the interdisciplinary                      
              required freshman course (The First Year Program), and them                    
              offering more appropriate science distribution courses. Science                
              modules will be developed for the First Year Program that will                 
              increase scientific awareness as well as literacy, will                        
              emphasize scientific reasoning, and will demonstrate the                       
              relationship between the natural sciences and other realms of                  
              human thought.
