Abstract    :
              Just as the preparedness of a classroom teacher directly                       
              effects the achievement/attitude of students in the school                     
              classroom, so can the same be said for the preparedness of                     
              university mathematics educators.  POEMT is a two-year program                 
              to develop a model preservice elementary teacher preparation                   
              program.  It offers professors and adjuncts an opportunity to                  
              participate in two summer sessions and corresponding academic                  
              years emulating the NCTM Standards.  Three weeks of intensive                  
              summer "coursework" at FIU including one week of actual                        
              clinical experiences are scheduled each year with follow-up                    
              activities each academic year.  Participants will be expected                  
              to deliver the fruits of their program participation each                      
              following academic year through trialling activities and                       
              revising their pragram/syllabus.  Forty participants will be                   
              carefully selected from across the country.  An outstanding                    
              staff of respected mathematics educators, including current                    
              NCTM President, has committed to lead instructional sessions                   
              and visit sites.  Funding support has also been pledged by                     
              Delta Airlines, Cuisenaire Company, and Longman Publishers.                    
              The proposal makes a strong case for the need to provide                       
              opportunities for professors to upgrade their knowledge and                    
              skills to guide the restructuring of preservice teachers, and                  
              to interact with colleagues over extended periods of time.
