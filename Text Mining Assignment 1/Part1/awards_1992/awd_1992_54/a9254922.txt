Abstract    :
              9254922  Adams    This project explores a way of forming a link between theories
              of  problem solving and theories of instruction on problem solving.  A  single
              problem-solving framework is used to analyze the discourse  patterns of the
              teacher, of students in small-group problem-solving  sessions, and of
              individual students solving problems.  The  problem-solving framework focuses
              on five areas of knowledge: (a)  mathematical content, (b) problem-solving
              strategies, (c) beliefs  about mathematics, problem-solving and the self, (d)
              control of  cognition and (e) discourse knowledge.  Three instructional units 
              of approximately three weeks each are identified before the  beginning of the
              school year for two middle-school classrooms.   These instructional units are
              the focus of concentrated data  collection in which whole class instruction and
              small group problem  solving are video taped.  Additional classroom
              observations are  made on a regular basis throughout the school year.  Also
              four  students from each classroom are video taped as they complete 
              think-aloud problem-solving interviews once a month throughout the  year. 
              Problems used in the problem-solving interviews are  coordinated with the
              instructional units in order to from  hypotheses about the connection between
              classroom discourse  patterns and process used by individual students.  ***
