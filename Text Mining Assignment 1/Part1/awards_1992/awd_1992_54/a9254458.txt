Abstract    :
                      9254458  August, John    This 3-year project aims at giving 3 groups of
              24 well-  prepared, motivated high school teachers from the Mid-Atlantic 
              region an indepth experience in mathematical modeling.   Participating schools
              are asked to send teams (consisting of  1 mathematics and 1 science teacher) to
              a 1-year (spring-  summer-fall) program.  The capstone of the program is the
              week  the teachers spend on-site at the Chincoteague National  Wildlife Refuge,
              working on modeling problems of current  interest to the Fish and Wildlife
              Service, which manages the  Refuge (for example, beach erosion, migration,
              traffic, and  the like).  In the 6 months prior to the summer field 
              experience, the teachers will learn some of the mathematics  that underlies
              modeling by attendiing 6 2-day workshops.  In  the post-summer fall semester,
              the teachers turn their  attention to such educational issues as:  how to use
              their  summer experience to their students'advantage; writing lesson  plans in
              modeling; sharing their knowledge with other  teachers; etc.  The project
              emphasizes writing, and the  results of the teachers' work (reports, charts,
              graph, etc.)  will be made available to the Wildlife Service and the 1.5 
              million annual visitors to the Refuge.  The project evaluation  will focus on
              changes in the teachers, their classrooms, their  colleagues, and their
              schools.  ***
