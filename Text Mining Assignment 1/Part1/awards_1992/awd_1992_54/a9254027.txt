Abstract    :
              We are further developing and disseminating a remarkably simple                
              and effective instructional technique -- ConcepTests coupled                   
              with Peer Instruction -- which has shown to be very effective                  
              in revitalizing instruction and improving student learning in                  
              science courses.  The technique has two primary goals:                         
              1.  to expose students' common misconceptions about fundamental                
              principles via the use of ConcepTests, and                                     
              2.  to rectify these notions, and promote understanding of                     
              basic concepts, through Peer Instruction.  Greater                             
              understanding, in turn, leads to a greater appreciation of the                 
              material, and is ultimately expected to result in an increased                 
              interest in the sciences.                                                      
              Initial application of this method in introductory physics                     
              classes indicates that our program achieves both of these                      
              objectives.  We are extending our initial research to other                    
              disciplines, fine-tuning our procedure, and systematizing its                  
              application so it can be widely applied in undergraduate                       
              science, mathematics and engineering education.
