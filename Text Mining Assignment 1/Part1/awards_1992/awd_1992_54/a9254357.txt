Abstract    :
              The proposed project in scientific visualization will enhance                  
              undergraduate courses in science, mathematics, and engineering.                
              It will also improve the education of undergraduates who plan                  
              to pursue a career in teaching science and mathematics at the                  
              pre-college and college level.  Students will learn about using                
              visualization as a tool for discovery and understanding complex                
              phenomena.  In addition, they will also learn about state-of-                  
              the-art visualization techniques that allow scientists and                     
              engineers to examine huge amounts of data with higher                          
              efficiency and greater comprehension.  Finally, students will                  
              be provided with hands-on experience of software packages that                 
              are widely used in the field.  the project injects a component                 
              into our curriculum that heretofore has not been widely                        
              applied.
