Abstract    :
              This proposal is offered by New York University's College of                   
              Arts and Science.  A new, integrated series of introductory                    
              level science courses will be developed for 1,600 non-science                  
              majors annually. The new curriculum takes into account the                     
              level of preparation and the extent of alienation of students                  
              from science and mathematics.  The proposed curriculum aims to                 
              teach quantitative reasoning and emphasize the open-ended                      
              questioning aspect of scientific thinking by means of lectures,                
              inquiry-based laboratory experiences and recitations, and                      
              cooperative study teams.  The intention is to develop, pilot,                  
              and refine an experimental version of such a multicourse                       
              curriculum in 1993-95, and in 1995 to replace the existing                     
              elective science and mathematics requirements at NYU with this                 
              program.  All non-science majors will eventually have equal                    
              exposure to a corpus of interesting material in a Science Core                 
              Program.  Design features will permit a certain measure of                     
              individualization in learning, as well as encourage the                        
              development of small, cooperative problem-solving study groups,                
              breaking students out of isolation and replicating the research                
              model of scientific inquiry.
