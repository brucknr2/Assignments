Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This planning planing grant will lead to a proposal from a                     
              coalition of five independent public school districts in                       
              northern Maine.  The sparse population, diversity of the                       
              districts, and economic impact of a closing military base                      
              have caused the districts to investigate new ways of                           
              providing for the post-baccalaureate education of their                        
              teachers and, consequently, to improve the science and                         
              mathematics education of their students.                                       
                                                                                             
              The districts have data to show that of the students who                       
              graduate from their schools, few go to college and those                       
              that do tend not to concentrate in science or mathematics.                     
              The PI's feel that if the teachers are better prepared and                     
              the system is better able to respond to the teachers needs,                    
              the students will become better educated and more                              
              enthusiastic.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              The five step planning grant includes a series of                              
              conferences in the Fall followed by a week-long Summer                         
              institute where detailed plans will be specified.  The                         
              written plan (Step 4) will lead to a formal grant proposal                     
              (Step 5) for establishing a long-term self-supporting                          
              teacher education program in the region.
