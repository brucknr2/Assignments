Abstract    :
              Differential geometry of curves and surfaces has an important                  
              role in solidifying the standard courses in beginning calculus                 
              and linear algebra.  The topic provides the tools for                          
              visualization of geometric phenomena and for applications to                   
              physics, engineering, computer science, and other areas of                     
              mathematics.  The subject is particularly well-suited to                       
              interactive computer graphics.  In this project, a complete set                
              of transportable, interactive computer graphics laboratory                     
              modules is being developed.  The materials can be used to                      
              supplement standard courses in calculus and linear algebra, or                 
              to supplement a standard textbook in elementary differential                   
              geometry.  The materials can also provide the foundation on                    
              which to build a laboratory intensive differential geometry                    
              course.  Innovations include the use of new "hypertext" tools                  
              for interaction and response, and the use of computer graphics                 
              to enhance the visualization experience.  Each module presents                 
              a single topic or related topics, illustrated by examples that                 
              can be modified by students in response to questions and                       
              suggestions.  The modules are written in a demonstration-                      
              investigative mode, well suited for cooperative and                            
              collaborative activities.  The target student audience includes                
              students considering concentrations in mathematics, physics,                   
              engineering, and computer science.
