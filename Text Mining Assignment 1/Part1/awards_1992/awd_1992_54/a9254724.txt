Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This planning grant will lead to a full proposal from the                      
              University of North Texas for a Teacher Institute which                        
              offers a master's degree in elementary science.  The                           
              planning grant will begin examining elementary science                         
              protocols, establish design teams to make decisions on                         
              content, and begin the process of redesigning existing                         
              university courses.  In all, 12 courses, 3 credits each,                       
              will be modified by the design teams.  Through this project,                   
              a major will be created which prepares teachers in content,                    
              methodology, and in their new roles as change agents in                        
              schools which use site based management.                                       
                                                                                             
              The planning grant begins the processes that lead to the                       
              Teacher Institute.  The new concentration is expected to be                    
              institutionalized by the end of the grant.  The University                     
              of Texas is cost sharing 92% of the project.
