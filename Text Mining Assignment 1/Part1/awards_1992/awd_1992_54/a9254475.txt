Abstract    :
              Materials are being developed to support teacher education                     
              activities at project sites in Georgia, western New York, Michigan             
              and other sites throughout the country as well.  The units focus on            
              selected content and processes emphasized in the NCTM Standards.               
              Their development is informed by research on the teaching and                  
              learning of mathematics.  Leadership Seminars that feature the                 
              units will be held for individuals involved in  working with                   
              secondary teachers in a variety of contexts.  Seminar participants             
              will implement the units into their teacher education programs,                
              analyze the effectiveness of their use, and offer suggestions on               
              how the units might be further refined.  Leadership Seminars will              
              be open to state and local teacher educators and to teacher                    
              educators associated with various statewide systemic initiatives or            
              statewide teacher collaborative projects.  An inservice program                
              that features the units will be held for teachers who supervise                
              student teachers in an effort to better articulate preservice and              
              inservice programs.  The project's teacher education activities                
              will provide a rich context for conducting research on teacher's               
              knowledge and beliefs about the content and processes in the units,            
              about ways teacher educators implement the units and the role                  
              required of them in doing so, and the nature of teachers'                      
              experiences as they leave their preservice program and begin their             
              careers as mathematics teachers.
