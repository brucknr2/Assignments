Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This 3-year project from the Educational Service Center,                       
              Region 16, Belleville, IL, plans to enhance elementary                         
              science teaching for the region by combining efforts of                        
              teachers, administrators, and parents in 15 elementary                         
              schools with the resources of a local institution of higher                    
              learning and the technical assistance of the Educational                       
              Service Center.  Project activities will span 3 years with 5                   
              weeks of course work for leaders each summer and extensive                     
              implementation and follow up activities during the school                      
              year.  The LITES (lead teachers) will be trained in the use                    
              of several validated activity-based science curricula, will                    
              select course options to improve their science knowledge,                      
              and will learn leadership skills to assist other teachers in                   
              implementing activity-based science.  School teams will be                     
              comprised of an administrator, primary, and intermediate                       
              teacher.  Schools with significant populations of minority                     
              students will be given priority.                                               
                                                                                             
              This leadership proposal is appropriate for teacher                            
              enhancement because it is designed to enhance the science                      
              knowledge and teaching, and develop leadership skills of                       
              teams of teachers from participating schools, and because it                   
              targets teachers of a needy population.                                        
                                                                                             
              Non-NSF cost-sharing is approximately 39% of the amount                        
              requested from NSF.
