Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This 3-year leadership project will enable 2-cohorts of                        
              Houston area 8th and 9th grade physical science teachers to                    
              attend a Leadership Institute at the University of Houston-                    
              University Park.  Each cohort will have 24 teachers.  The                      
              Leadership Institutes have a two week summer institute and                     
              six Saturday workshops during the academic year.  Each                         
              cohort will attend for two years, overlapping in year -2 of                    
              the project.  Physics and Chemistry content will be                            
              delivered with discipline appropriate pedagogy.  To broaden                    
              a teacher's network, some AY follow-up will occur at a                         
              professional meeting of the Texas Science Teachers'                            
              Association.  Leader Teachers will give peer-led workshops                     
              in their local and neighboring districts.  They will be                        
              supported by LEAs, industry and the senior personnel from                      
              the project.  The Principal Investigator for the project is                    
              Dr. Hugh T. Hudson.                                                            
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing equals 10% of the NSF award.
