Abstract    :
              The goal of Project VTC is to introduce and explore the use of                 
              pedagogical "cases" in teacher education in mathematics and                    
              science. These cases are realistic scenarios which raise                       
              contextualized issues of theoretical and practical concern for                 
              discussion and analysis. Pedagogical cases are beginning to be                 
              used in teacher education to teach such generic aspects as                     
              problem solving and classroom management, but this approach has                
              rarely been tried in the subject matter areas, including                       
              mathematics and science. Project VTC will produce approximately                
              one hour of videotape representing several pedagogically                       
              interesting cases in secondary-level quantitative science.                     
              These cases will integrate issues of school children's                         
              mathematical understanding and expression with their developing                
              sense of fundamental scientific concepts. Project VTC will also                
              produce a short manual to accompany the videotaped cases. This                 
              manual will provide a brief introduction to the use of                         
              pedagogical cases in general, as well as suggestions for using                 
              the cases presented on the tape. The Project will disseminate                  
              these materials to mathematics and science educators and to                    
              researchers in the use of case studies in teacher education.
