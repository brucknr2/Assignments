Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of this project is to develop through a consensus-building            
              process, one or more models for technical and conceptual assistance            
              to educators and implementers of school networks.  These models                
              will be used by technology planners and managers in many different             
              settings to inform their decisions about the use of computer-                  
              mediated communication in schools.  To build credible and effective            
              models, participants in the process will examine underlying                    
              assumptions about what school networks can and can't accomplish,               
              and how services can best be delivered to a broad national                     
              audience.  Stakeholders from a broad range of federal,                         
              professional, state and local educational communities will deepen              
              their understanding of issues and choices surrounding school                   
              networking.
