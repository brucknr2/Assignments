Abstract    :
              The project challenges high aptitude freshmen and sophomores through the       
              use of computers to stimulate their creativity.  The students are              
              undertaking alternate laboratory explorations aided by interactive             
              videodiscs and computer interfaced instruments.  Among the activities          
              they are engaged in is design their own experiments on suggested topics,       
              constructing appropriate interfaces to a variety of instruments ranging        
              from Spectronic 20 manual spectrometers and pH meters to gas                   
              chromatographs and atomic absorption spectrophotometers and the use of         
              spreadsheets for data analysis.
