Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Each year for three years, 40 teachers of high school                          
              psychology will be chosen to attend a four week workshop at                    
              the University of Houston.  The workshop has a multiplicity                    
              of components where each of the teachers would learn about                     
              psychology, educational theory and research, aiding the                        
              development of effective demonstrations and teaching                           
              techniques, and fostering communication between high school                    
              and college teachers.  Over the course of the next two                         
              years, each teacher will agree to complete a research                          
              project in some particular area of psychology.  Each teacher                   
              is expected to access an electronic network where a five to                    
              ten page update will be posted at least once each month.                       
              These updates will be prepared initially by the faculty of                     
              the University of Houston and Western Carolina University,                     
              but will be broadened in succeeding years to include faculty                   
              from other universities.                                                       
                                                                                             
              The cost share of this project represents 21.3% of the grant                   
              request.
