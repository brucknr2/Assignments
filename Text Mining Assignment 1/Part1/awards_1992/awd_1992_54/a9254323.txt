Abstract    :
              The focus is science and mathematics education for non-science                 
              majors.  A team of ten faculty members from the science and                    
              mathematics departments at DePaul University will develop a                    
              three quarter, interdisciplinary science sequence, with                        
              mathematics integrated throughout. In the sequence, students                   
              will explore the basic principles underlying modern science and                
              the growing degree to which multidisciplinary approaches are                   
              needed to attack problems in health, ecology, and the                          
              environment.  The sequence will emphasize the scientific                       
              process, as well as major themes in physics, chemistry, and                    
              biology.                                                                       
              Although the sequence will be developed for all non-science                    
              majors, the project will give special attention to those                       
              preparing to be teachers.  In collaboration with DePaul's                      
              Center for Urban Education, the project will establish                         
              structured clinical experiences for education majors in public                 
              elementary and middle schools in Chicago.  Acting as Scientists                
              in Residence in these schools, students will adapt hands-on                    
              activities from the course for the children and teachers.
