Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              We propose to develop a series of 12 exhibits on the topic of                  
              feedback.  We will create an introductory cluster of 4-5                       
              exhibits situated in our "Patterns" section to introduce the                   
              basic concepts.  We sill situate each of the remaining 708                     
              exhibits in the area of the museum that suits it                               
              phenomenologically.  A continuity in the theme of feedback                     
              will be created through Feedback Pathways (both a field trip                   
              Pathway and a general use Pathway) and associated maps which                   
              will be available in the introductory cluster>  These will                     
              guide both visitors and school classes from area to area with                  
              feedback as the unifying element.  The feedback behavior                       
              exemplified in these exhibits will be accessible to both young                 
              and older audiences and will be strongly connected with the                    
              "Themes of Science" listed in the California State Science                     
              Framework for Pre-College Science Education.  The exhibits                     
              will receive extensive use in our teacher training programs at                 
              both the elementary and secondary level.  Exhibit evaluation                   
              will take place at the level of extensive prototyping by                       
              exhibit development and teaching staff and on a more formal                    
              level in conjunction with a formative evaluation program.  We                  
              will disseminate this work in a publication describing                         
              inexpensive classroom versions of Exploratorium exhibits.  In                  
              addition, we will experiment with the dissemination of our                     
              work to other museums through the Internet Computer Network.
