Abstract    :
              This is a three-year "Accomplished-Based Renewal" project that                 
              seeks to extend and broaden on previous work carried out by the                
              PI to design growing season climate predictions for the                        
              agriculture of the midwestern part of U.S.A.  The research will                
              also examine the use of climate information (including                         
              predictions) by U.S.A. agribusiness.                                           
              This research project is important because it will contribute                  
              toward the creation and synthesis of unique hydrological,                      
              thermodynamics, economics and crop data sets to benefit the                    
              agriculture industry of North America.
