Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This joint workshop will further coordination began at the                     
              Panarctic Biota working group that met a year ago                              
              (February 1991) to develop databases on arctic flora and                       
              fauna and will expand the areas of cooperation to fishes                       
              and invertebrate organisms.  The ecology of the arctic                         
              regions is extremely fragile and susceptible to stresses                       
              caused by economic development and global climate change.                      
              The meeting is being organized by Dr. David Murray of the                      
              University of Alaska at Fairbanks and Academician Vladimir                     
              Sokolov of the Institute of Evolutionary Animal Morphology                     
              and Ecology of the Russian Academy of Sciences.                                
                                                                                             
              This project fulfills the program objective of advancing                       
              scientific knowledge by enabling leading researchers in                        
              the United States and Russia to combine complementary                          
              efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual                             
              interest and competence in the field of basic scientific                       
              research on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and                            
              mutuality of benefit.
