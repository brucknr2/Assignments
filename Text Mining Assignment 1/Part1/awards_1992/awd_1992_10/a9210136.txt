Abstract    :
              The 1992 Gordon Conference on Condensed Matter Physics is devoted              
              to "Quantum Collective States in Solids with Localized Moments."               
              Topics include multi-channel Kondo phenomena, one-dimensional                  
              antiferromagnetic chains, unconventional superconductors and theory            
              of the metal-insulator transition.  The goal of the conference is              
              to address important topics at the frontiers of modern Condensed               
              Matter Physics while also providing surveys of several more mature             
              areas that continue to provide surprises.  The funds will be used              
              to assist graduate students to attend the conference.
