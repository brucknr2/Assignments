Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The focus of this research is on solutions of the Bayesian                     
              multiple integration problem in econometrics, using a class of                 
              numerical integration procedures widely known as Gibbs samplers.               
              The objectives of the project are to make Bayesian inference as                
              routine and reliable as classical methods in econometrics, and to              
              provide solutions of outstanding econometric problems on which                 
              little progress has been made heretofore using either Bayesian or              
              classical approaches.                                                          
                                                                                             
              The project involves extensions of the analysis of Gibbs samplers              
              to develop central limit theorems appropriate to the systematic                
              assessment of numerical accuracy, evaluate senstivity to initial               
              conditions, and apply these methods ot underidentified models.                 
              The project will also exploit the successive conditioning                      
              fundamental to Gibbs sampling and the related technique of data                
              augmentation, to develop a modular treatment of most econometric               
              models.  These modules include semi-informative priors in                      
              regressions, censored regression, heteroskedasticity, seemingly                
              unrelated regressions, the multinominal probit model, reduced                  
              rank regression, the latent factor model, multivariatre (moving                
              average) autoregression, and state space models.
