Abstract    :
                   This award supports the development of a computer software                
              system enabling large scale research computing projects dealing                
              with systems of polynomial equations in many variables.  The                   
              result of the project will be a usable and efficient computer                  
              program, which executes the Groebner basis algorithm for                       
              computing standard bases and syzygies of ideals and modules over               
              polynomial rings.  Improvements over the existing program,                     
              Macaulay, will include the addition of a good programming                      
              language for the user, the ability to work over more general                   
              coefficients rings, and increased speed of execution.                          
                   This project is in the general area of commutative algebra                
              and the computer-aided computational aspects of this field.                    
              There is a growing interest in using computers to answer                       
              theoretical questions in algebra and conversely, algebra is quite              
              useful for the development of algorithms.  This project makes                  
              serious use of both the theory and practice of symbolic                        
              calculations to solve real problems in commutative algebra.
