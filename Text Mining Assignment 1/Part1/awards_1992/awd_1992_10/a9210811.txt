Abstract    :
              In this research project, the module-theoretic approach applied to             
              multi-variable poles and zeros is used in the context of robotics              
              and aircraft control applications. The major emphasis is on                    
              developing a new unified approach to intertwine module -theoretic              
              research and modern control system theory. It combines work in the             
              area of commutative algebra with applications in feedback theory.              
              Utilizing this method avoids the necessity of imposing restrictive             
              assumptions on system minimality, causality and squareness. An                 
              intense software study of specific examples relevant to the                    
              methodology is included in the research project.***  //
