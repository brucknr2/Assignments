Abstract    :
              Basic research studies on the growth and characterization of                   
              oriented thin films of magnetic materials on GaAs single crystal               
              substrates will be conducted.  The approach uses laser ablation  as            
              the primary film growth method, and includes consideration of                  
              lattice matching between the substrate and the deposited magnetic              
              films.  Permanent magnet compounds that have uniaxial anisotropy               
              and are lattice matched to either (100) or (111) GaAs substrates               
              will be investigated.  Examples are the t-MnAl phase(CuAu-type),               
              its related ternary alloys MnAlM(M=Ni, Cu, Zn) which are compatible            
              with (100) GaAs, and the NiAs-type structure such as MnBi, MnSb,               
              and MnBiSb compatible with (111) GaAs substrates.  Characterization            
              of the structural, compositional, and magnetic properties of the               
              films is an integral part of the research.

              This research addresses the epitaxial growth of thin films of                  
              magnetic materials on compound semiconductors which offers many                
              possibilities for the discovery of new devices and the integration             
              of magnetic storage media and active electronic or opto-electronic             
              components for improvements in devices and integrated circuits used            
              in computing, information processing, and telecommunications.
