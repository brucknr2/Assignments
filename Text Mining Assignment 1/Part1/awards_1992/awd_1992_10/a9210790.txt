Abstract    :
              In this Experimental Physical Chemistry project, funded by the                 
              Chemistry Division, Prof. Cynthia Jameson will use xenon NMR                   
              and molecular dynamic simulations to determine the nature of                   
              elementary processes in microporous zeolites. By monitoring how                
              xenon is partitioned between cages of different size in the                    
              zeolite, long standing questions regarding the diffusivity of                  
              adsorbates and the potential role of intercage transfer in                     
              catalysis will be answered.                                                    
              %%%                                                                            
              Zeolites, microporous solids which have enormous utility as                    
              catalysts, are among the most significant commercially                         
              available classes of materials. Prof. Cynthia Jameson (Univ. of                
              Illinois, Chicago Circle) will adsorb xenon gas into these                     
              materials, and use a battery of modern spectroscopic and                       
              computational techniques to determine how the xenon atoms are                  
              distributed among the pores, how they move from place to place,                
              and how long they stay there. The result will be an improved                   
              understanding of dynamic events related to catalytic activity                  
              of the micropores.
