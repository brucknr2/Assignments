Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is a study of the organization of technological                      
              inventive activity within and across national boundaries and of                
              the participation of the United States and other countries.                    
              Inventive activity is an intellectual tradition which is                       
              cultivated in most societies.  Inventors, their laboratories or                
              firms, and nations compete with each others in inventive                       
              activity, but they often also cooperate with others.  One goal is              
              to describe the dispersion of inventive activity (in the form of               
              patents, for example) across the world.  Another goal is to                    
              examine the position of the United States and to compare it to                 
              other centers of inventive activity (Japan and Western Europe).                
                   The study will enhance our understanding of the patterns and              
              dynamics of technological development and its links with science               
              and the economic in national and international contexts.
