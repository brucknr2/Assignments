Abstract    :
                 This proposal is for a study of variable surface proteins of                
              Neisseria. The investigator has identified proteins called pilins,             
              which are different in pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains. These            
              proteins show antigenic and phase-specific differences, which will             
              be studied further. Clones have been isolated, and the genes will              
              be investigated. Undergraduates will be involved, and a RUI                    
              application is anticipated.

              This proposal is to study differences between surface proteins                 
              called pilins on pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains of the                  
              bacterium Neisseria. The genes for these proteins appear to be                 
              expressed at variable times during the bacterial life cycle; this              
              will be further investigated why the proteins differ between the               
              pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains.
