Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The research suggests measuring the pressure drop across a                     
              oscillating bubble which is attached to a needle, and which is                 
              submerged in an aqueous surfactant solution.  As the surface                   
              area of the bubble expands and contracts, surfactant exchanges                 
              with the surface, and this exchange can be measured from the                   
              pressure drop data trace.  A theory is outlined to described                   
              the oscillating exchange, and from the measurements the                        
              surfactant rate constants can be quantified.  Once obtained,                   
              the kinetic parameters can be applied to interpret the effects                 
              of surfactants on many interfacial flows.
