Abstract    :
              Preliminary research leading to the                                            
              development of monolithic complementary                                        
              pseudomorphic III-V compound heterjunction                                     
              bipolar transistors on InP substrates is                                       
              proposed.  The novelties in proposed approach                                  
              are the use of two different material systems                                  
              for achieving optimum pup and npn HBTs on                                      
              the same substrate and the use of InP                                          
              substrates which makes the proposed                                            
              complementary HBTs integratable with                                           
              optoelectronic devices.                                                        
                                                                                             
              During the time covered by the Research                                        
              Planning Grant, the necessary theoretical                                      
              development that will lead to guidelines for                                   
              the design of the optimum complementary                                        
              HBT structures will be accomplished.                                           
              Experimentation leading to the production of                                   
              the complementary HBT structure will be                                        
              initiated with emphasis on the                                                 
              InA1As/InGaAs structure.  In addition, with                                    
              material provided by the Naval Research                                        
              Laboratory, in Washington, DC demonstration                                    
              of a functional pnp InGaAs/InAlAs HBT will                                     
              be accomplished.  Although, initial efforts will                               
              emphasize InP lattic match material systems,                                   
              future plans are to expand to pseudomorphic                                    
              layers in material systems with more promising                                 
              characteristics.
