              Program for invited speakers from the U.S. to                                  
              participate in the workshop: "Generalized                                      
              Inverses- Computational Techniques and                                         
              Applications".  The workshop will be held at

              Economics where pioneer work on generalized                                    
              inverses was done by C.R. Rao and S.K. Mitra                                   
              The center continues to attract eminent                                        
              scholars of international reputation.  The                                     
              workshop will include: presentations by                                        
              outstanding scientists on contributions to date                                
              in the theory of generalized inverses and their                                
              applications to Statistics and Electrical                                      
              Engineering, contributed papers giving the                                     
              latest developments in the field of generalized                                
              inverses by active researchers, and panel                                      
              discussions to identify the directions of                                      
              future research and to list open problems.                                     
                                                                                             
              Scope:  The air travel of six US scientists                                    
              will be supported by this proposal.  As the                                    
              bulk of research in generalized inverses has                                   
              shifted away from the US to India, Europe,                                     
              Japan and China, this workshop will be an                                      
              opportunity for US scientists to share their                                   
              knowledge with the rest of the world and to                                    
              take stock of the prevailing situation and                                     
              determine new research directions.    The                                      
              workshop will be a boost for research in                                       
              generalized inverses and their applications.
