Abstract    :
              The focus of this project is the                                               
              development of a mathematical                                                  
              model for cell adhesion.  This                                                 
              project will extend present models                                             
              by incorporating the transient                                                 
              processes that occur during cell                                               
              adhesion into the model.  The                                                  
              investigator will obtain analytical
