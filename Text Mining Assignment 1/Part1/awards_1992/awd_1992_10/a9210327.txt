Abstract    :
              The proposed research is directed towards finding classification               
              algorithms that are trained from examples and achieve good                     
              generalization performance.  A new training procedure is                       
              investigated that adjusts the complexity of the classifier to the              
              problem at hand in order to optimize the tradeoff between perfect              
              memorization and good generalization.  The new algorithm applies               
              to a large variety of classification functions, including                      
              polynomial classifiers, two layer neural networks, or radial basis             
              functions.  Initial experiments on optical character recognition               
              problems demonstrate both its performance relative to other                    
              learning algorithms, and its efficiency regarding time and memory              
              requirements.  Topics for investigation include the estimation of              
              the VC dimension of the resulting classifiers, and the study of the            
              relationship between VC dimension and generalization performance               
              on a wide variety of problems in order to obtain a robust algorithm            
              that performs well even when no expert knowledge in the training               
              procedure to further improve performance will be considered.  the              
              ability of the algorithm to find atypical, misclassified, or                   
              meaningless, or misclassified patterns will be investigated to                 
              automatically clean databases.
