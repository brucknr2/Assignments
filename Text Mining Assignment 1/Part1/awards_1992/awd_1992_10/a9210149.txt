Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Nerve cells extend highly polarized processes, called dendrites and            
              axons, through which they communicate with each other.  Repeated               
              physiological stimulation of a neuron may result in long-term                  
              changes at the synapse, the site where connections are made.  A new            
              theory suggests that nerve cells may synthesize proteins close to              
              the synaptic site, depending on synaptic activity; the majority of             
              proteins in most cells is made by the protein synthetic machinery              
              in the cell body (the soma).  The goal of this research project is             
              to assess the extent to which neurons employ extrasomatic protein              
              synthesis.  Associate components of the protein synthetic machinery            
              will be identified in extrasomatic domains of neurons, and the                 
              accumulation of such components in those domains will be correlated            
              with physiological activity at the synapse.  Primary cultures of               
              neurons from both the central and the peripheral nervous system                
              will be used in this approach.  In summary, this project seeks to              
              establish the functional significance of decentralized protein                 
              synthesis as a potential basis for long-term modulations of protein            
              repertoires in extrasomatic domains of nerve cells.
