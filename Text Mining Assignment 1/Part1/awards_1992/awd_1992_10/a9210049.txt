Abstract    :
              The design of structurally fault-tolerant (FT) multiprocessors,                
              which can reconfigure around fault components to preserve                      
              interconnection structure, is an important problem in computer                 
              architecture.  While a number of design methods have been proposed             
              previously, they suffer from a lack of generality, and also fail               
              to address practical issues like low redundancy, efficient                     
              reconfigurability and design scalability.  In this project we are              
              primarily concerned with implementing a software package based on              
              the node-covering and automorphic methods for designing and                    
              simulating fault-tolerant systems, extending both design methods               
              to deal with link and switch failures, devising techniques for very            
              fast and distributed reconfiguration, developing principles for                
              more efficient realizations of our designs, and designing systems              
              with high average-case fault tolerance (and thus a high                        
              reliability-to-cost-ratio).  We also investigate how the node-                 
              covering formulation can be applied to incorporate fault tolerance             
              in uniprocessors, and in various types of logic circuits,                      
              especially those that can be realized as iterative arrays of                   
              simpler cells
