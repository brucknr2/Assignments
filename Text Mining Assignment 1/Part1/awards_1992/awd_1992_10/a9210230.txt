Abstract    :
              The goals of this project are to: (1) study multiresolution                    
              approximations of nonstationary stochastic processes; (2) establish            
              a novel framework for studying nonstationary signals, and (3)                  
              develop new analytic tools for addressing the related challenging              
              problems of time-varying filtering, estimation, and coding.  An                
              optimal scaling function is proposed for "best" (in the mean-                  
              square sense) low-resolution approximation of a given process.                 
              Such an approximation is expected to improve the performance of                
              filter banks used in subband coding for the efficient transmission             
              of image or voice data.  It will also lead to optimal feature                  
              extraction procedures in pattern recognition problems, appearing               
              in underwater and remote sensing applications.
