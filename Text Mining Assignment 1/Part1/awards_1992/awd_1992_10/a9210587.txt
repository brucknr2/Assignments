Abstract    :
              This research effort is directed at developing improved global                 
              illumination algorithms for image synthesis.  Monte Carlo                      
              techniques avoid artifacts due to the discretization of the                    
              environment required for radiosity methods and are favored                     
              when the geometry of the rendered objects are freeform                         
              surfaces rather than polygonal objects.  The major problems                    
              with the Monte Carlo methods are the noisy characteristic of                   
              the solution and the high sample rate required to bring the                    
              noise down to an acceptable level.  Importance sampling and                    
              stratified sampling are two methods that can significantly                     
              reduce the noise level and sample rate required for a high                     
              quality solution.  Radiosity methods can be used to provide                    
              guidance for importance sampling.  Model preprocessing can be                  
              used to locate known discontinuity curves on the model                         
              surfaces and to partition the surfaces into pieces that are                    
              expected to have smooth illumination for stratification.                       
              Trimmed spline representations can be used to represent the                    
              illumination functions over each surface.
