Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              There are large, reliable differences in probability judgments                 
              made by individuals in Western countries like the United States                
              and those in many Asian countries.  Most differences pertain                   
              to calibration.  (Good calibration exists, for example, if about               
              40% of the events that are assigned probability judgments of 40%               
              actually happen.)  However, differences in discrimination have                 
              been documented, too.  (Discrimination is the ability of                       
              judgments to sharply distinguish instances when a target event                 
              will occur from those when it will not.)  Several potential                    
              explanations of the observed differences will be tested with                   
              subjects in the United States and several Asian locations.  The                
              major research hypothesis is that the variations rest on cognitive             
              processing habits rooted in different cultural traditions,                     
              including ones pertaining to social interactions.  Another                     
              proposition is that the differences are an artifact of previous                
              researchers' sampling of judgment tasks.  According to a third                 
              explanation, the distinctions are specific to particular judgment              
              topics and to student subjects.  A final explanation says that                 
              the differences reflect cross-national variations in the relative              
              importance of various aspects of judgment quality.  This research              
              promises insights into universal judgment mechanisms as well as                
              ones peculiar to given cultures.  It should also provide guidance              
              about problems in cross-national communication and collaboration               
              and for improving decision technologies and their transferability.
