Abstract    :
              The project develops a better understanding of competitive                     
              strategies of multiproduct firms in the specific context of                    
              retailers.  The research will involve both theoretical and                     
              empirical analysis of competitive strategies.  The theory relies               
              on a game theoretic framework with an important feature often                  
              absent in such cases.  Consumer decisions are endogenous to the                
              theoretical model, and are predicated on information provided by               
              firms.  Where information is lacking, consumers have expectations              
              which are fulfilled in equilibrium, i.e., rational expectations.               
              Empirical work spans an examination of supermarket pricing and                 
              advertising strategies over a long time, and a study of consumer               
              patronage of supermarkets in the same market.  Thus, the                       
              empirical study follows the theory which treats both firms' and                
              consumers' decisions as endogenous.  The empirical study provides              
              insights into specific institutional mechanisms.  However, the                 
              model is general, thus providing insights into the phenomena of                
              multiproduct firms and multifaceted competition which are                      
              becoming increasingly important.  Finally, the research will move              
              marketing science away from its focus on a single brand to the                 
              case of multiproduct firms with multiple strategic options.
