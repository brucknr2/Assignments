Abstract    :
                   Marginal Models refer to models built on the structure of                 
              generalized linear models, but extended beyond the Gaussian case               
              to a wide class of distributions for discrete or continuous-                   
              valued variables.  This project will extend these models to                    
              growth curve models with particular emphasis on discrete data.                 
              Implementation of software, particularly for modest computing                  
              support will be undertaken as part of this project.                            
                   When individuals are observed over a period of time, the                  
              objective of the data analysis is usually both to examine the                  
              pattern of change for the individuals and to examine the                       
              commonalities of these patterns among individuals.  Often this                 
              leads to distinctions among groups of individuals or to                        
              associating features of these patterns with particular attributes              
              of the groups.  This research will develop statistical procedures              
              for this kind of analysis.
