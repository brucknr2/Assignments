Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objectives of this research are to explore the dynamic                     
              molecular structure of liquid crystals by using two-dimensional                
              Fourier transform ESR and high-field ESR techniques.  Detailed                 
              relaxation data are acquired to infer both the long-time and short-            
              time molecular motions.  The description of molecular motions in               
              liquid crystals are enhanced by studies of transnational diffusion             
              of the probes both at the molecular level and the macroscopic                  
              level.  These studies are of special value for characterizing                  
              structure and dynamics of ordered systems.
