Abstract    :
              This proposal is to examine the role of regulation of gene                     
              expression by progestins, and to determine the importance of a                 
              third class of progesterone receptor protein (progesterone receptor            
              protein C) interactions with two previously identified receptors.              
              The progesterone receptor C may have a negative regulatory effect              
              on receptors of the A or B class, by combining with them and then              
              reducing their responses to progestins. The C receptor protein                 
              appears to be missing one of the two zinc fingers possessed by the             
              A and B proteins, but contains other features of these proteins,               
              allowing mixed dimers to form. The start site of transcription will            
              be determined; a putative site (met 595) has been identified by the            
              P.I., but needs to be further characterized.                                   
              %%%                                                                            
              Progesterone is a steroid hormone which binds to intracellular                 
              receptors and affects gene expression in both males and females.               
              The mechanism of this regulation is not known. Two types of                    
              receptor have been described; this proposal deals with a third                 
              type, which may have a negative interaction with the first two                 
              types. Its production from cDNA and its interactions with the A and            
              B class of progestin receptors will be investigated.
