Abstract    :
              Social aphids provide a new arena for the study of the evolution of            
              sterile altruistic castes.  Two basic issues that have not been                
              addressed in any social aphid are the mechanism of origin of a                 
              discrete sterile caste and the relatedness of the defending                    
              individuals to their beneficiaries.  Molecular methods will be used            
              to test a specific hypothesis for the origin of a sterile caste in             
              some Pemphigus species.  Under this hypothesis, some individuals               
              are forced into sterility because they lack endosymbionts at birth.            
              The tests depend on methods for the molecular detection of                     
              sequences previously established as unique in aphid endosymbionts;             
              the hypothesis predicts that these are present in all individuals              
              except sterile defenders.  In addition, genetic fingerprinting                 
              methods will be developed and used to examine the genotypic                    
              composition of colonies of a social and non-social Pemphigus                   
              species.  In both segments of this project, previously existing                
              laboratory cultures of Pemphigus clones will provide controls and              
              test material.  These methods will be useful in future                         
              investigations concerning the genetic structure of partially clonal            
              aphid populations.  The research involves an important group of                
              insects which feed on native American trees.
