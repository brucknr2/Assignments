Abstract    :
              Since the 1950s, the National Science Foundation has relied on                 
              the categories of basic research, applied research, and                        
              development in an effort to compare R&D expenditures in both                   
              the public and private sectors using a common set of                           
              definitions.  The objective of this research is to question (1) how            
              completely or accurately the basic/applied/development                         
              classification scheme reflects the overall R&D process and (2)                 
              the generality of any one classification scheme throughout the                 
              manufacturing sector.                                                          
                                                                                             
              Based on extensive telephone interviews and mail surveys to a                  
              representative sample of firms in the chemicals industry, the                  
              machinery industry, and the electric and electronic equipment                  
              industry, information on the composition of R&D will be                        
              collected and evaluated in an effort to supplement the                         
              basic/applied/development scheme with more discrete                            
              expenditure categories.
