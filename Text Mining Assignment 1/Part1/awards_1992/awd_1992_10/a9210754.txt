Abstract    :
                   Demand substitutions are common in practice, in the                       
              manufacturing, distributions and service industries.  An example               
              where downward substitution structure arises is the steel industry             
              where steel beams of greater strength can substitute for beams of              
              lesser strength.  This project will develop a general framework                
              which identifies properties of the optimal policies and efficient              
              algorithms to calculate the optimal policies for large size and                
              real life problems.                                                            
                   There are few studies that deal directly with the problem of              
              demand substitutions, and most of them deal with only the specific             
              case of two products.  The models and solution techniques are                  
              useful in solving a variety of problems like safety stock                      
              locations, and allocations of cards to customers in the car rental             
              industry, and the yield problem in the airline industry.
