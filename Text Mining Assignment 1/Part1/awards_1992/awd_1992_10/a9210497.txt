Abstract    :
              The central theme of the proposed research is to determine the role            
              of dichogamy (temporal separation between male and female flowers),            
              and herkogamy (spatial separation between male and female flowers)             
              in promoting matings among individuals and/or preventing                       
              interference between male and female function both within and                  
              between flowers on individual plants.  Dichogamy and herkogamy are             
              widespread among angiosperms and are often found together; however,            
              little is known about the precise role each contributes to an                  
              individual's reproductive success.  The proposed study organism,               
              hermaphroditic Sabatia angularis (Gentianaceae), is self-                      
              compatible, dichogamous and herkogamous.  The role of dichogamy and            
              herkogamy in influencing an individuals fitness will be quantified             
              using chimeric plants when dichomgamy and herkogamy are (1) both               
              functioning, (2) only one is functioning, and (3) neither is                   
              functioning .  The role of dichogamy and herkogamy will also be                
              examined as a function of flower age, size of floral display (in               
              promoting self-pollinations between flowers on the same plant), and            
              plant density.  Pollen donors will be exactly determined using                 
              experimental plant arrays of unique genotypes known from allozyme              
              markers.  Male function will be determined by measuring pollen                 
              production, pollen removal rates and siring ability via allozyme               
              markers in the same experimental plant arrays.  Female function                
              will be estimated by quantifying pollen deposition onto stigmas and            
              seed set per fruit.  These studies explore basic aspects of plant              
              pollination and reproduction.
