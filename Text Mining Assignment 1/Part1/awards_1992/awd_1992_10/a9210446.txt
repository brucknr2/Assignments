Abstract    :
              Adaptive and sensory materials are a class of material systems                 
              which contain their own sensors, actuators, and microprocessor                 
              capabilities and can be used in many applications requiring a                  
              high degree of adaptability to changing external and internal                  
              conditions.  The basic aim of current research activities is to                
              develop and synthesize materials systems which mimic biological                
              organisms, i.e., the human arm, which can perform sophisticated                
              slewing and robotic tasks, change the stiffness, sense numerous                
              environmental conditions and adapt to them, all with the aid of                
              highly integrated sensor (nervous system), actuator (muscular                  
              system) and control (brain system).  A three day conference will               
              be held to provide an international forum highlighting                         
              innovations and new research developments related to all aspects               
              of actuator and sensor development and their control.
