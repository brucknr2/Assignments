Abstract    :
              The semantic foundations of imperative languages shall be studied in           
              this project with the aim of sharpening the understanding of how state         
              can be utilized.  Local variables and interference control will be             
              emphasized in this study.  Denotational models for local variables             
              will be investigated and the connections between locality and                  
              parametricity will be explored.  In addition, type systems which               
              control the manner in which the state is utilized will be developed.           
              This work is intended to lead toward programming frameworks which              
              support the flexibility and efficiency of imperative programming and           
              the simplicity and elegance of functional programming as well.
