Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Compromised brain function can occur in the absence of apparent                
              structural damage. Certain types of brain scans which show only                
              structural features may appear normal, yet other types of scans                
              based on the metabolic activity of the neurons will show changes               
              in discrete brain regions that are related to the functional                   
              disturbances. In this award to Drs. Ruthmary Deuel and Lyndon                  
              Hibbard, the metabolism of brain regions will be measured by the               
              method of 2-deoxy-D-glucose, which is a metabolic marker. The                  
              syndrome of hemineglect will be produced by cortical damage and                
              changes in metabolic activity in areas removed from the damage                 
              itself will be studied during the recovery process. The syndrome               
              of hemineglect involves an abnormality of spatially directed                   
              attention and motor performance. The precise localization of                   
              neuronal metabolic changes associated with this syndrome will be               
              studied by computer reconstruction of brain sections. This work                
              will contribute to understanding brain function in normal                      
              individuals and during recovery from damage.
