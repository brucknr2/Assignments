Abstract    :
              Wolpert         The objective of this research is to recreate the function  of a
              network of biological neurons using a VLSI-based neuronal  analog, of
              neuromime.  By reconstructing a well-documented  network of biological neurons
              and comparing the signal patterns  resident in the artificial network with
              those of the biological  network, the hardware and sorfware of the network may
              be related  to one another.         This is being carried out in five
              iterations of modify,  design, and test.  In each iteration, a nominal
              neuromime is  augmented with discrete components to match the characteristics 
              of each of nine biological counterparts.  These changes are then  incorporated
              into the nominal chip, submitted for fabrication,  and subsequently tested.
