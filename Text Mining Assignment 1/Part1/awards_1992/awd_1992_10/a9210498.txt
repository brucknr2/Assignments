Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Financial support ($4,000) is requested for eight graudate students            
              and postdoctoral fellows to participate in this biannual meeting on            
              solid state chemistry.  The program includes 23 young and                      
              established speakers from United States and Europe.  Speakers will             
              discuss topics such as superconducting fullerides, microporous                 
              solids in catalysis, and nonlinear optics in communication.  In                
              addition, the organizers will specifically ask for posters from the            
              graduate students, postdoc, and young faculty, and will select 8               
              top contributions by graduate students and postdocs for financial              
              support.  The chief aims are to:  1) expose future scientists to               
              the latest research in solid state chemistry, 2) provide a medium              
              for the new comers to interact with established scientists from                
              academic, industrial, and government laboratories, and 3) hear a               
              first-hand report from Professor A. Ellis on the NSF Program in                
              Solid State Chemistry for Undergraduate.  This last portion is                 
              focussed on the introduction of material chemistry into                        
              undergraduate curriculum.  The Gordon Research Conference is                   
              scheduled for July 27 - 31, 1992.
