Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will create the first complete data set containing                
              county level occupational censuses for nineteenth-century Britain              
              and will supplement a demographic data set already created by the              
              investigator.  Completion of the project will allow scholars to                
              begin a quantitative study of the female labor force in nineteenth-            
              century Britain in an attempt to measure the impact of                         
              industrialization on female labor force participation.                         
                                                                                             
              Female employment patterns today have generated much research and              
              legislation.  These patterns have historical roots that can be                 
              investigated to determine the importance of institutions and                   
              culture on economic activity.  Using the proposed data set, the                
              reasons for the decline in female participation rates can be                   
              explored.  It can also be determined whether or not                            
              industrialization necessarily leads to competitive labor markets.              
              Occupational segregation and industrial segregation can be measured            
              and compared.  The importance of "noneconomic" factors on women's              
              work can be examined as can the "economic" factors which                       
              traditionally affect demand for and supply of female labor.
