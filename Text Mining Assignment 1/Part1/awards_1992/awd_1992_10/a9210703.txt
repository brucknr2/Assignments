Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Experiments are proposed to study management decision making in                
              industrial markets characterized by uncertainty and asymmetric                 
              information:  (1) Markets in which incumbent firms may try to                  
              limit entry through strategic price manipulations and (2) Markets              
              in which a large chain-store may attempt to limit entry in its                 
              markets by establishing a reputation for being a tough                         
              competitor.  A series of pilot experiments in both markets raise               
              a number of questions that go well beyond the original theory                  
              that occasioned the experiments.  New experiments are offered to               
              answer these questions.  The overall focus of the experiments is               
              to better understand information processing and decision making                
              by managers in industries with uncertainty and asymmetric                      
              information regarding rival firms' underlying cost structure.
