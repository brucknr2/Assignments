Abstract    :
                   This project investigates the combination of error                        
              correcting codes and equalization on storage system communication              
              channels, seeking maximum performance with minimum decoding                    
              complexity.  These channels incur significant levels of                        
              interference between successively transmitted symbols                          
              (ISI) when operating at high linear densities and require                      
              constrained input alphabets, yet they must operate at extremely                
              low error rates.  Achieving high performance with minimum                      
              complexity under these restrictive conditions will extend and                  
              optimize the use of error correcting codes and equalization                    
              on storage systems.  Specific topics addressed are: (1) Optimal                
              division of computational complexity between coding and                        
              equalization functions on magnetic, magneto-optical and optical                
              recording systems, (2) Analysis and theory of decision feedback                
              equalization designed for minimal error propagation, (3) Analysis              
              of storage systems as concatenated coding systems using inner                  
              modulation codes and outer Reed-Solomon codes, and (4) Theory                  
              of multi-dimensional equalization and coding for increased areal               
              density.  Results should apply to storage channels and to more                 
              general nonideal communications channels.
