Abstract    :
              The goals of this project are to develop a rod shear device to                 
              study shaft friction, to develop experimental techniques to                    
              measure changes in tangential stress in soil near a pile, and to               
              measure how the state of stress near the surface of a pile                     
              changes due to axial loading on the pile. A granular soil will be              
              confined in a rod shear device that can apply anisotropic                      
              confinement to the soil specimen. The tangential stresses in the               
              soil will be measured by the velocity of compression waves in the              
              tangential direction near the surface of the rod using miniature               
              geophones and piezoelectric crystals embedded in the soil                      
              specimen.
