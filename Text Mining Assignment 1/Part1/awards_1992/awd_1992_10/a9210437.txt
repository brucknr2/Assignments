Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is a collaborative study on criminal careers (with                   
              Nagin, SES92-11896).  The study will test two competing models of              
              criminal careers.  One model suggests that there are two classes               
              of offenders (frequents and occasional) and that each has a                    
              different probability that an offender desists criminal activity               
              after a certain number of convictions.  The second models assumes              
              that each individual in a population has a propensity for                      
              engaging in criminal behavior, and that the offending rate for an              
              individual remains constant over the life course.  The study will              
              employ mixture Poisson regression models and latent-threshold                  
              normal regression models to analyze data from three longitudinal               
              data sets on criminal activity.                                                
                   This study will increase our understanding of patterns of                 
              crime over individuals' lifetime and of the social and individual              
              characteristics associated with criminal careers.
