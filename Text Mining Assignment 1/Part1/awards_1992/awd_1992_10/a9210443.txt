Abstract    :
                   The proposed research revolves around two general questions:              
              1) Complete classification of problems according to which                      
              frequency algorithms they are amenable; and 2) Complete                        
              understanding of the of the recursion-theoretic properties of                  
              frequency computable problems.                                                 
                   Computing, as it is practiced today, is of an interactive                 
              nature.  Rather than the model of twenty years ago, where the                  
              computer was presented with a program and ran until it obtained                
              an answer, the programs of today pause frequently and ask for                  
              input before continuing.  Thus the true model of computing, as it              
              is practiced, is the Turing machine with an oracle.
