Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This study takes the premise that imperfectly competitive product              
              markets and variations in the degree of market power possessed by              
              firms play important roles in how a variety of aggregate shocks                
              affect employment and economic activity.  This study intends to                
              examine various models of imperfect competition in which the                   
              equilibrium markup changes in response to aggregate shocks.                    
              Particular attention will be given to developing a theoretically               
              rigorous and empirically tested quantitative model of the effects              
              on U.S. output and employment of energy price changes.                         
                                                                                             
              The empirical success of the various theories will be tested in two            
              ways.  First, the effects of certain shocks (such as changes in                
              world oil prices) upon the U.S. economy will be estimated using a              
              relatively atheoretical econometric specification.  These estimated            
              impulse responses will then be compared to the quantitative                    
              predictions of "calibrated" versions of the theoretical models.                
              Second, certain structural equations of the models (especially                 
              those linking average mark-ups to other macroeconomic variables)               
              will be estimated econometrically, and the coefficient restrictions            
              implied by the various theories formally will be tested.                       
                                                                                             
              This project is meritorious because it deals with substantive                  
              economic matters - the influence of market structure on aggregate              
              fluctuations.  It will also serve to close current methodological              
              gaps between alternative schools of macroeconomic thought.                     
              Finally, the study of the consequences of oil price shocks is in               
              itself a very important and noteworthy activity.
