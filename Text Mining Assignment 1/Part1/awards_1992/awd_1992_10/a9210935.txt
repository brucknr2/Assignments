Abstract    :
              Schreier         Delta-sigma modulation forms the foundation for the highly 
              linear and manufacturable analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog  converters
              known as "oversampled noise-shaping" converters. These  circuits find
              application in narrow band systems such as digital  audio equipment and medical
              and geophysical instrumentation. At  present, there are no adequate tests for
              stability of these  nonlinear systems - designers can only use extensive
              computer  simulations and hope that the simulations exercise the circuit 
              adequately. This research is developing a quick and completely  rigorous method
              which combines analytical techniques with  numerical algorithms to prove the
              robust stability of a  delta-sigma modulator.         The idle-channel noise of
              delta-sigma modulators is a second  research topic. How to guarantee aperiodic
              behavior in  delta-sigma modulators is being shown, but this alone is not 
              sufficient to guarantee an absence of tones. Listening  experiments using data
              derived from simulations need to be  performed in order to judge the
              effectiveness of the technique.          The results of these investigations
              are being incorporated  into a computer program for the automated design of
              delta-sigma  modulators.
