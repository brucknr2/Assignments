Abstract    :
                In accomplishing some tasks, biological visual systems can                   
              outperform even the most sophisticated image processing systems.               
              The goal of this research is to build optoelectronic circuits                  
              which perform some important image sensing and processing tasks                
              in a somewhat similar manner to the biological visual systems.                 
              The circuits are then not only useful in performing these tasks                
              better than conventional methods, but also provide a tool of                   
              analysis, a level of abstraction, for the original biological                  
              systems.  This goal is methodically pursued by proposing elements              
              of a visual system that are based on a basic model of ionic                    
              conduction in nerve membranes.  Processing capabilities of each                
              of the proposed elements is demonstrated.  Next, more                          
              sophisticated tasks are proposed which can be performed by                     
              combining these basic elements together.  It is argued that this               
              intelligent control of acquisition of visual data is essential                 
              for real time operation in a complex dynamic world.//
