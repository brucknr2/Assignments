Abstract    :
              The research to be performed on this RIA award will investigate                
              fracture behavior of bimaterial interfaces through the use of new              
              types of bimaterial specimens and test fixtures.  Based on a full              
              range of mode mixities, failure loci of various bimaterial                     
              interfaces will be determined.  This study will provide an                     
              understanding of those mechanisms which are important to                       
              improving the macroscopic toughness of brittle composites.
