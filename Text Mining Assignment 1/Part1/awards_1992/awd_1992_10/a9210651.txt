Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a joint seminar proposed by Dr. Jackson Yang, the                      
              University of Maryland, and Professor Yung-Chun Wu, National                   
              Chiao Tung University supported by the AIT (U.S.) - CCNAA                      
              (Taiwan) Cooperative Science Program.  This seminar will focus on              
              the issue of automation and productivity for small and medium                  
              scale manufacturing industries.   Advanced manufacturing                       
              processes is an important topic for both the U.S. and Taiwan.                  
              Automation has not been extensively incorporated in the small and              
              medium-sized manufacturing industries in the U.S.  Taiwan, on the              
              other hand, has been successful in incorporating such processes                
              in its manufacturing process.  A workshop on this topic can                    
              benefit the scientists and the manufacturing industry in both the              
              U.S. and Taiwan.  The issue is important and the knowledge                     
              derived from this meeting can be useful in terms of future U.S.                
              industrial competitiveness. The Materials Processing and                       
              Manufacturing Program and the Industrial Centers Division have                 
              each contributed $2,500 in joint funding for this workshop.
