Abstract    :
              This is a Career Advancement Award in the area of condensed matter             
              physics.  This research investigates the processes that cause                  
              transition-metal ions to lose excitation nonradiatively, rather                
              than radiatively.  The nonradiative decay is relevant to                       
              efficiencies of tunable solid-state lasers employing trivalent                 
              chromium, titanium, and divalent cobalt.  Such lasers have                     
              industrial, environmental monitoring, and medical applications.                
              Optical and resonance Raman spectroscopy will be used to measure               
              the vibrational spectra of several trivalent chromium-doped                    
              crystals and glasses that differ in the amount of energy the                   
              chromium ion loses nonradiatively.  Relationships between the                  
              vibrational spectrum and the nonradiative rate will be sought.                 
              This will add to the understanding of the electron-phonon                      
              interaction in transition-metal ion doped solids, and may determine            
              which ion/host combinations are likely to produce better tunable               
              solid-state laser.
