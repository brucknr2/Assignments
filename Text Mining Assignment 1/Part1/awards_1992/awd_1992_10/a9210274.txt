Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objectives of this Research Planning Project are to design,                
              synthesize, and characterize mixed-metal heterocyclic compounds, to            
              study the ring opening polymerization to yield polymeric compounds             
              with M-P-S backbone, to investigate the structure, composition, and            
              properties of organometallic/inorganic polymers and their                      
              decomposition to II-IV-V materials, to synthesize, characterize and            
              purify liquid trimethylsilyl-substituted phosphine compounds, and              
              to study the thermal decomposition of these compounds to elemental             
              phosphorus.  The results from this research can find applications              
              in devices such as light emitting diodes, infrared detectors, and              
              optical oscillators.
