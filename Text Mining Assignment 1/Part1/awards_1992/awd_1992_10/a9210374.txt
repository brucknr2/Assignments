Abstract    :
              This RIA award will investigate the effect of microstructural                  
              variations on the radiative shielding capability of microspheres               
              filled with composite materials.  Observed changes in shielding                
              efficiency are to be related to the mechanisms active for wave                 
              front or particle interference of the microstructure under                     
              consideration.  Based on these results and theoretical arguments,              
              models of microstructure dependent behavior will be developed.                 
              These models will then be used to predict enhanced shielding for               
              radiation of different types and for particles of varying energy.
