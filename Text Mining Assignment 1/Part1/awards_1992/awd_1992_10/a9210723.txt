Abstract    :
                   The objective of this research is to develop models which                 
              consider the possibility of future innovations while taking                    
              acquisition and replacement decisions.  In particular, the research            
              focuses on a capacity expansion and replacement model wherein a                
              sequence of technological breakthroughs are anticipated but their              
              magnitude and timing are uncertain.  A firm, operating in such an              
              environment, must decide how much capacity of the current best                 
              available technology to acquire to meet the future demand growth.              
              It must also determine whether to replace any of the older vintages            
              partially or completely, with the focus on obsolescence rather than            
              deterioration as the motive for replacement.  Such decisions are               
              of the essence in electronics and other industries characterized               
              by rapid technological change.                                                 
                   This research also considers the interaction between product              
              life cycles and manufacturing flexibility in a rapidly changing                
              market.  This work is motivated by the economic analysis of                    
              investment decisions in flexible assembly lines for automobile                 
              assembly.  The advent of future generations of products lead to                
              obsolescence of dedicate transfer lines.  Flexible lines, on the               
              other hand, can process successive generations of product.  The                
              high investment required in flexible assembly line is weighed                  
              against the reduced obsolescence of such lines.
