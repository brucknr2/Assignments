Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to                                            
              develop a quantitative                                                         
              thermodynamic basis for the                                                    
              analysis and design of protein                                                 
              separations, comparable to that                                                
              which is routinely applied to                                                  
              non-biochemical separations in the                                             
              chemical process industries.  The                                              
              theoretical work will be                                                       
              complemented by experiments                                                    
              addressing several aspects:                                                    
              characterization of structural and                                             
              functional protein properties,                                                 
              measurement of thermodynamic                                                   
              properties to verify the validity                                              
              of the thermodynamic descriptions,                                             
              and separations experiments to                                                 
              evaluate the predictions of                                                    
              performance based on the                                                       
              thermodynamic models.
