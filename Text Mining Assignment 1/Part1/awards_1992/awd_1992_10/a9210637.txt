Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal is concerned with thin film materials with a                     
              one-dimensional, spatially periodic composition variation.                     
              These are referred to as composition modulated alloys (CMAs),                  
              and they can exhibit extraordinary mechanical, magnetic and                    
              optical properties especially when the periodicity wavelength                  
              is of the order of nanometers.  The proposal suggests using                    
              electrochemical deposition, rather than the conventional                       
              vacuum deposition, to fabricate the CMAs, and the study will                   
              focus on the deposition of NiFe films.  NiFe alloys with                       
              uniform composition are used, because of their high saturation                 
              magnetization and high initial permeability, for read/write                    
              heads for computer disk drives and as underlayers for                          
              perpendicular recording media.  CMAs of NiFe have the                          
              potential for high performances in magnetic data storage                       
              because of the extra degree of freedom.  The films will be                     
              deposited using a uniform injection (rather than rotating                      
              disk) flow cell.  Flow pulsations are used to periodically                     
              vary the composition of the film as it is deposited on the                     
              electrode surface.
