Abstract    :
                This proprosal is funded under the Research Initiation Awards                
              (RIA) Program Announcement, NSF 88-99.  Current computational                  
              environments for scientists suffer from various deficiencies.                  
              They are generally non-interactive and difficult to program.  The              
              provide little in the way of direct manipulation interfaces,                   
              domain-specific constructs or facilities for symbolic (non-                    
              numerical) programming.  This work will build a suite of                       
              programmable applications for computational physics in three                   
              domains:  oscillators, difusion-limited aggregation, and chemical              
              kinetics.  These applications will be designed to maximize                     
              expressiveness.  The will have interactive, learnable interfaces               
              and a domain-enriched dialect of Scheme to provide                             
              programmability.  This will provide a prowerful and expressive                 
              computational media for scientists.  The experience will be                    
              articulated in termas of broad, practical guidelines for                       
              programmable application design.
