Abstract    :
                   To support various product engineering applications                       
              efficiently, product models need to be represented with higher-                
              level geometric entitles, from which meaningful engineering                    
              information can be extracted.  The objective of this project is to             
              develop a representation scheme for product models based on form               
              features.  The intent is to provide a product model to support                 
              various product engineering activities through a central form                  
              feature decomposition that possesses intrinsic advantages                      
              applicable to a wide range of manufacturing process design                     
              activities.  The central form feature decomposition is to be                   
              obtained by automatic recognition of form features using a convex              
              decomposition called Alternating Sum of Volumed with Partitioning.             
              Geometric domain of product shapes that the feature decomposition              
              covers is extended to support practical parts by exploiting local              
              rounding operations.                                                           
                   The product model scheme to be developed must serve as the                
              core of the integration of product engineering, from design to                 
              manufacturing.
