Abstract    :
                   An understanding of the link between climate change and water             
              quality of surficial hydrologic systems requires reliable                      
              quantifiable estimates of past changes in effective moisture                   
              (precipitation-evaporation) and hydrochemistry.  The fossil record             
              of lacustrine ostracodes (Crustacea) from closed basin lakes                   
              located in the northern Great Plains will be used to develop                   
              quantitative estimates of effective moisture and solute histories.             
              The estimates will be obtained using a modern calibration data set             
              of paired ostracode and environmental data, and by applying                    
              recently developed multivariate statistical techniques in order to             
              obtain analogs of the fossil ostracode assemblages.                            
                   The estimates obtained from this study will be compared to                
              estimates of salinity and effective moisture developed from                    
              independent data sets derived from the same lake cores and based               
              on diatoms and ostracode shell trace-elements and mineralogy.                  
              This Research Planning Grant is the first step in a larger research            
              effort to develop a new method for obtaining paleoclimatic and                 
              paleohydrologic reconstructions for the northern Great Plains that             
              can be used in GCM validation and for forecasting of climate-                  
              induced hydrologic changes.
