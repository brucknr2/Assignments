Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This Research Planning Grant will support a preliminary                   
              study of the degree to which role characteristics and role                     
              strains affect physical and mental health.  The investigator                   
              plans to use data from the National Survey of Families and                     
              Households.  The investigator is particularly interested in how                
              gender and race affects the relationship among these variables.                
              The planning grant will be used to develop and test the                        
              measurement of variables such as role strain, and mental and                   
              physical health, and to conduct preliminary analyses of the data.              
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                   The planning activities supported by this award will allow                
              the investigator to refine measures and develop an analytic                    
              strategy necessary for the development of a strong research                    
              proposal on an important and interesting topic.
