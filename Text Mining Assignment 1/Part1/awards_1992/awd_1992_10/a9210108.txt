Abstract    :
              The objectives of this project are                                             
              to produce new knowledge on the                                                
              molecular genetics and enzymology of                                           
              anaerobic butyric clostridia that                                              
              will allow beneficial genetic                                                  
              alterations of the cell metabolism                                             
              for a variety of applications.                                                 
              Butyric acid clostridia have an                                                
              excellent potential for industrial                                             
              applications to produce commodity                                              
              and specialty chemicals.  The                                                  
              current knowledge base on the                                                  
              genetics, regulation and metabolism                                            
              of these cells has been limited, but                                           
              considerable progress has been made                                            
              by work on previous grants.  This                                              
              project will continue the study of                                             
              gene regulation, develop further the                                           
              expression systems in clostridia,                                              
              and evaluate other factors involved                                            
              in the regulation of metabolic                                                 
              pathways in clostridia.
