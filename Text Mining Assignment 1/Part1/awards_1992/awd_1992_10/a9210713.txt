Abstract    :
              The research is to study the application of fractal geometry to                
              characterize crack patterns formed on the fracture surfaces of                 
              cross-linked thermoset polymers.  Fracture experiments will be                 
              performed on a series of well characterized resins (ranging from               
              rubbery to brittle) and on non-Newtonian fluids of varying                     
              viscosity.  Numerical methods will then be developed for                       
              analyzing pattern formation in these systems to better understand              
              the physical and chemical processes which contribute to the                    
              fracture behavior.  The fractal dimensions and other scaling                   
              exponents characterizing the geometrical and topological features              
              of the tree-like cracks will be analyzed to determine whether                  
              there is a relationship between these exponents and the material               
              properties.
