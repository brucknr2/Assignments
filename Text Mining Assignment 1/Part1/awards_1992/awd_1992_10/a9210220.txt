Abstract    :
              This is the first-year funding of a three-year continuing award.               
              The process of updating a view in a relational database usually                
              requires the translation of an update into updates over the                    
              underlying base relations. This process can be complex since the               
              translation may not be unique.  A generalization of the view                   
              update problem in relational databases is equivalent to the                    
              update of an intensional relation in a deductive database in                   
              which only the extensional database can be modified. The aim of                
              this research is to design and implement update algorithms for                 
              stratified normal deductive databases by incorporating                         
              disjunctions in the extensional part of the database.  The                     
              algorithms consider single insertions, single deletions  and                   
              transactions.  A fundamental structure for the implementation  of              
              the algorithms are interpretation trees that are used to compute               
              answers to queries in disjunctive deductive databases. The                     
              research also addresses the issue of integrity constraints in                  
              disjunctive databases. So far, constraint satisfaction in                      
              disjunctive databases has been relatively unexplored;                          
              nevertheless, it has been shown that there exists a strong                     
              connection between disjunctive databases with constraints and the              
              stable model semantics for normal logic programs.  Hence, the                  
              development of algorithms to check integrity constraints will                  
              indicate directions to define procedures to answer queries in                  
              normal logic programs under the stable model semantics.
