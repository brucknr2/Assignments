Abstract    :
              New techniques for parallelizing scientific computing programs for             
              distributed memory multiprocessors will be developed in this project.          
              In particular, the problem of compiling nested loops will be                   
              investigated.  The solution of a number of tiling problems will be             
              attempted first.  Then examination of methods of determining                   
              deadlock-free partitions, size, allocation, and scheduling of tiles            
              and minimizing communication for efficient parallel execution of               
              programs on distributed memory multiprocessors will be carried out.            
              In addition, new tools for optimizations dealing with architectural            
              capabilities of individual processors will be investigated.
