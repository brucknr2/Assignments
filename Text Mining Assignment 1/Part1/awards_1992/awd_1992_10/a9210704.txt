Abstract    :
                   The objective of this project is to develop techniques for                
              searching for and sharing software using wide-area networks.  This             
              will enable software reuse to go beyond libraries; a program written           
              for a single project may not be used directly, but instead be used as          
              a template for similar programs in other projects.                             
                   The principal investigator is conducting new research into                
              indexing and querying software databases.  Indexing information must           
              be generated automatically, with no extra effort by the program                
              creator.  Initially he is augmenting an existing CASE tool to generate         
              such indexing information.  Later research will integrate other                
              mechanisms for categorizing software.  Another part of the project is          
              to develop a distributed query mechanism for widely distributed,               
              autonomous, software databases.  This will incorporate features such           
              as automatically canceling queries which generate too many results.            
              An interface which helps user specify and refine queries is being              
              designed.                                                                      
                   Although the focus of this work is on sharing computer software,          
              the techniques developed could prove useful in sharing other                   
              information, such as data from scientific experiments or limited               
              interest (and therefore unpublished) studies.
