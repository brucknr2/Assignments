Abstract    :
              The proposal is to use differential                                            
              optical absorption spectroscopy to                                             
              study and determine the nature of                                              
              the fundamental bandgap in Ge-Si                                               
              strained superlattice                                                          
              nanostructures.  First principle                                               
              theoretical studies show that both                                             
              direct and indirect superlattices                                              
              exist, and previous experimental                                               
              studies have given some credible                                               
              support to these calculations.  The                                            
              experimental demonstration of

              nanostructures will open up a whole                                            
              new vista for Si as a photonic                                                 
              material.  A principal goal of the                                             
              proposed research is to forge a new                                            
              fundamental understanding of the                                               
              relationship between superlattice
