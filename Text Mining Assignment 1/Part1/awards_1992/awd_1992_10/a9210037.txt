Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The contribution of this project comes from the development of                 
              semiparametric estimators for models that have not previously been             
              considered, as well as new estimators for models that have been                
              considered in the statistical and econometric literature.  A great             
              deal of research in econometrics has been devoted to the                       
              development of semiparametric methods because these methods permit             
              analysts to obtain results from data even if very little is known              
              about the underlying processes that generated the data.                        
                                                                                             
              This project develops semi-parametric estimators for a number of               
              different models.  These include partially linear Tobit models,                
              partially linear logit models, partially linear Poisson regression             
              models, partially linear duration models, and Tobit models with                
              sample selection.  These estimators are defined by minimizing                  
              objective functions that are based on comparing all pairs of                   
              observations.  An investigation of the asymptotic properties of                
              estimators that are defined in this way will be conducted.                     
              Previous research on Tobit models with fixed effects will continue.            
              The possibility of estimating fixed effects versions of the so-                
              called Type 3 Tobit model will be addressed, and a two-step                    
              estimator is developed.  Software will be developed to permit                  
              others to use these techniques.
