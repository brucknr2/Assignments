Abstract    :
              This is an award to support work on the feasibility of                         
              using optical fibers in a system for monitoring of                             
              groundwater pollutants.  The work is based on previous                         
              development by the investigator of an optrode that                             
              utilized a chemical intermediary to detect and monitor                         
              water solutions of polar organic substances.  In this                          
              project, the investigator plans to devise an optrode and                       
              spectroscopic system for both saturated and unsaturated                        
              (vapor phase) conditions and to determine its potential                        
              applicability in survey of the movement of groundwater                         
              pollutants.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              The proposal leading to this project was submitted in                          
              response to NSF 90-121, Research Planning Grants and                           
              Career Advancement Awards for Women Scientists and                             
              Engineers.  The proposed work involves the conduct of a                        
              research planning grant.  It is responsive to the effort                       
              NSF is making to assist in increasing the number of new                        
              women investigators participating in NSF's supported                           
              research programs and to facilitate the conduct of                             
              preliminary studies and other activities that are likely                       
              to result in the development of competitive research                           
              projects by women who have not previously had independent                      
              Federal research funding.
