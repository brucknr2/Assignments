Abstract    :
              The study will investigate the mass, momentum, heat, and                       
              species transport processes occurring during the                               
              solidification processing of binary alloy metal matrix                         
              composites. The program will consist of both numerical and                     
              experimental components. The numerical study will make use of                  
              a single domain continuum approach, making use of appropriate                  
              constitutive relations, including permeability models, to                      
              account for the dispersed phase in the fluid and in the mushy                  
              zone. The results will be verified against solidification                      
              experiments with aqueous ammonium-chloride solution carrying                   
              isolated fibers. Flow visualization, and measurements of                       
              temperature and velocity fields will be obtained.
