Abstract    :
                   A new mathematical formulation will be investigated to model              
              concurrent decision-making in design.  Parametric models, initially            
              developed solely to study changes in optimized quantities as                   
              problem parameters are locally perturbed, will now be examined in              
              a broader design and manufacturing context.  Motivation is provided            
              by recent results on large parameter deformations in the field                 
              mathematical optimization.                                                     
                   The research effort examines the theoretical properties of a              
              new formulation, and examines the use of two different algorithms              
              to solve the models numerically.  Successful treatment of the                  
              research case studies will show how the concept of model optimality            
              integrates the design and manufacturing decisions in concurrent                
              engineering.
