Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to provide a methodology for the                  
              automatic construction of instruction sets for specialized                     
              application domains.  Specialized, programmable computers are                  
              useful in situations where a general purpose computer may be too               
              slow or expensive for the application. This research augments                  
              current high-level synthesis tools which derive a computer                     
              implementation when given an algorithm or instruction set as input.            
              The proposed technique takes benchmarks and a description of the               
              computer data path as input and produces as output the instruction             
              set that best uses the data path to run the benchmarks.  Topics of             
              research include reducing the dependency of the results on the                 
              compiler used, determining an adequate number of benchmarks needed             
              to produce an instruction set well-matched to the application                  
              domain, and investigating alternative methods of instruction set               
              derivation.  The proposed tool, when coupled with current high-                
              level synthesis systems, can provide a complete design system for              
              quickly mapping a specialized problem domain into a high                       
              performance processor.  This allows the realization of computation             
              accelerators for a broad class of disciplines, including real time             
              event processing, digital signal processing, and computational                 
              chemistry, physics, and biology.
