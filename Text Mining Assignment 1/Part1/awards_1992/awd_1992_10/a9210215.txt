Abstract    :
              In their investigation of boundary layer heat transfer in the                  
              presence of very high free-stream turbulence, Maciejewski and                  
              Moffat (1990) conclude that the RMS value of the streamwise                    
              turbulent fluctuations, u', plays a dominant role in                           
              determining the heat transfer coefficient, h.  However, for                    
              the set of experiments that they performed, the value of u'                    
              was highly correlated with the value of the RMS turbulent                      
              fluctuations normal to their heat transfer surface, v'.  The                   
              primary goal of the proposed research is to establish a set of                 
              boundary layer flows in the presence of high free-stream                       
              turbulence for which v' may be varied independently of u' in                   
              order to test by means of experiments the hypothesis that v'                   
              and not u' determines h.  This same hypothesis will also be                    
              tested by measuring the individual components of the turbulent                 
              fluctuations instantaneously, using the hot-wire techniques                    
              suggested by Blair and Bennett (1987), and attempting to                       
              correlated them with the instantaneous surface heat flux,                      
              which will be measured using a technique described by Mancuso                  
              and Diller (1991).  Measurements of the turbulent heat flux                    
              and the turbulent shear stress will also be made for each of                   
              the free-stream test conditions in order to test the                           
              hypothesis that v' is independent of u'v' for boundary layer                   
              flows in the presence of high free-stream turbulence.
