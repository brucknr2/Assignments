Abstract    :
               Human-machine interaction is a critical component of complex,                 
              highly automated systems such as space shuttle ground control and              
              flexible manufacturing systems.  In such systems, typically a team             
              of human operators acts as supervisory controllers:  monitoring                
              data, adjusting parameters, and detecting, diagnosing, and                     
              compensating for failures.  In the past, most research efforts in              
              this area have focused on a single human operator:  modeling one               
              operator's interaction with a complex system; designing single-                
              user displays, and so forth.  With the advent of knowledge-based               
              technology, more "intelligent" tools are appearing in the context              
              of monitoring and supervisory control.  Still, such tools are                  
              designed for use by a single operator.  The intent of this project             
              is to build models and methods to support cooperation between human            
              supervisory controllers and between humans and "intelligent                    
              associate systems" in supervisory control.  Specifically, the three            
                                                                                             
              objectives of the proposed are to: 1) Develop a framework for                  
              modeling distributed supervisory control; 2) Develop prototype                 
              knowledge-based tools based on the modeling framework; and 3) Apply            
              the modeling framework and collaborative knowledge-based tool                  
              design concepts to supervisory control environment:  satellite                 
              ground control at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.
