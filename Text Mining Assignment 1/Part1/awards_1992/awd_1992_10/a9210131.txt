Abstract    :
                   This research will deal with the properties of information as             
              used in model selection.  New information criteria have been                   
              developed which deal with situations of multiple data sets and/or              
              with models which may have the same dimension.  This research will             
              expand on recent results for these criteria, and in particular will            
              establish asymptotic properties.                                               
                   This research will deal with statistical model selection.  The            
              area, generally speaking, is concerned with the choice of the best             
              model to fit a dat set among a set of candidate models.  Issues of             
              interest include problems of overfitting and the selection of                  
              variables in regression.
