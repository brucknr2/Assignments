Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal studies a dialysis flow cell which has been                      
              formulated by the PI and is termed an "antisedimentation                       
              dialysis system." In this system, two streams containing                       
              solute particles and solvent flow countercurrently in channels                 
              which are placed on opposite sides of a semipermeable dialysis                 
              membrane.  The exits of each channel contain a barrier                         
              membrane which allows only passage of the solvent.  When the                   
              dialysis membrane does not permit passage of solute, strong                    
              solute gradients in the flow direction develop as solute piles                 
              up at the flow exit barriers.  For a semipermeable dialysis                    
              membrane, solute transport reduces these gradients and causes                  
              the concentration to become more uniform.  This process can be                 
              used to measure hindered diffusion coefficients of solute                      
              through the pores of the semipermeable dialysis membrane                       
              barrier, and more importantly, can be used in fractionating                    
              solutes.
