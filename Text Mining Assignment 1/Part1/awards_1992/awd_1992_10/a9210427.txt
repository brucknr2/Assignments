Abstract    :
              This is a research planning grant to investigate a method for                  
              determining the parameters of model functions.  This method                    
              may prove to be less sensitive to noise and more generally                     
              applicable than commonly used methods such as least-squares                    
              (LS) and its variations.  The algorithm for this method                        
              consists of multiplying the original model function by a set                   
              of "test functions" and then integrating to form the inner                     
              products.  The data points are multiplied by the same test                     
              functions and numerically integrated.  The two results are set                 
              equal to one another, yielding a system of constraints on the                  
              unknown parameters.  For sufficiently many test functions,                     
              this system of constraints can be solved for the unknown                       
              parameters.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              During the planning period it will be determined whether this                  
              method is feasible as an alternative to other modeling                         
              techniques.  In particular, it may be useful when measurement                  
              errors are not known or there are possible outliers that one                   
              does not wish to delete.  The method will be applied to a                      
              variety of data sets, and well-conditioned test functions will                 
              be examined to improve its performance.
