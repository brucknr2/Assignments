Abstract    :
                This research addresses computer-aided design (CAD) data                     
              modeling and view construction, as well as updating both                       
              materialized views and the underlying database in support of                   
              design activities. Database support provides a means to share                  
              data between CAD tools and multiple designers; however, only a                 
              small portion of the contents of a database may be germane to a                
              particular design application. A copy of the relevant data (a                  
              materialized view) may be stored and modified locally during a                 
              design step. Maintaining consistency between a database and views              
              of it entails ensuring that changes to the database are reflected              
              in the view data, and vice versa. Database view technology to                  
              efficiently and correctly support extraction and manipulation of               
              relevant views of design objects will be developed, including a                
              formal CAD data model and an extended object-oriented query                    
              algebra for view specification. Algorithms for view maintenance                
              will be derived from the formal semantics. Database support for                
              CAD offers opportunities for concurrent design by simplifying the              
              maintenance and sharing of technology-related data. View                       
              processing provides a conceptual framework for unifying a CAD                  
              software environment; both the input and output of a tool are                  
              views of a design. This research seeks to facilitate                           
              interoperability of tools and cooperation between designers via                
              CAD database view technology.
