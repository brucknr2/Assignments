Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This two year plan of postdoctoral study will allow Dr. Kirkus the             
              opportunity to develop an important independent research program               
              toward understanding prejudice in subtle and overt forms so that we            
              may have a better knowledge of the situational constraints that                
              promote positive cross-ethnic relations.  The plan has four                    
              components:  (1) conducting a project examining the effects of                 
              self-disclosure of personalized information on intergroup                      
              relations, (2) receiving training in psychophysiological                       
              measurement, including the use of facial electromyography (EMG),               
              (3) visiting appropriate laboratories in Europe to develop                     
              collaborative research, and (4) being an active member of the                  
              Intergroup Relations Laboratory at USC.
