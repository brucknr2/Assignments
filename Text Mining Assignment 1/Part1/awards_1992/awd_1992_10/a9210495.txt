Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Atmospheric deposition, as rainfall and dryfall, is an                         
              increasingly important source of biologically-utilizable nitrogen              
              in estuarine and coastal regions: about 30% of their combined                  
              nitrogen loading comes from atmospheric sources.  Nitrogen from                
              atmospheric deposition may be a unique source of nitrogen in                   
              coastal waters, as direct surface water deposition may occur                   
              downstream of estuarine nutrient stripping zones that assimilate               
              the majority of terrigenous nitrogen loading.  Moreover, analyses              
              of rainwater reveals that dissolved organic matter can be a                    
              significant fraction of the total dissolved nitrogen in                        
              precipitation from both continental and oceanic origins.  This                 
              nitrogen from rainfall has been shown to stimulate primary                     
              production in coastal waters adjacent to North Carolina.  Impacts              
              of atmospheric nitrogen deposition will be elucidated by assessing             
              algal primary production and trophic responses with complementary              
              bioassays and stable isotope tracers measurements at the natural               
              abundance level.  The three sources of nitrogen in rainwater                   
              (nitrate, ammonium, and dissolved organic nitrogen) will be                    
              followed into primary producers with stable isotopes, while                    
              species composition and photosynthetic rates are monitored.  The               
              transfer of primary products from algae to both microbial and                  
              zooplankton populations will be assayed to investigate the                     
              response of grazing and the microbial loop to increased                        
              productivity.  A quantitative model and budget of nitrogen                     
              entering the area from atmospheric deposition will be the final                
              result of the study.  Results may be useful to global modelers                 
              attempting to assess the importance of atmospheric deposition on               
              climate and species diversity.
