Abstract    :
              Active sound cancellation, as an important technique in  noise                 
              control, requires an effective control algorithm to achieve its                
              optimum performance. The objective of this project is to design                
              the algorithm using feedback control theories which not only                   
              enhance the performance, but also reduce the installation cost.                
              One of the difficulties facing the feedback design is the                      
              infinite-dimensional nature of the sound system. The novelty of                
              this study is to use the closed-form transfer function to                      
              describe the dynamics of sound. The transfer function reveals                  
              many useful properties which are lost when a discretized model,                
              such as the modal expansion, is used. The proposed study which                 
              seeks (a) to develop a time-domain recursive identification                    
              scheme can directly identify the dynamics of sound in ducats;(d)               
              to develop the repetitive control system for harmonic noise                    
              cancellation; (c) to experimentally verify the performance of the              
              repetitive control system; (d) to develop a broad-band active                  
              noise controller based on transfer function models; (e) to extend              
              the result to sound cancellation of higher modes. The study will               
              complement the research of microphones and loudspeakers used in                
              active sound cancellation. Also, it provides a good case study of              
              the feedback optimization of distributed parameter systems.                    
              Although only active sound control is considered, this study has               
              potential applications to general vibration control.***  //
