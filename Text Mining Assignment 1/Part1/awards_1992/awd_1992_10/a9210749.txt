Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              There has recently been a great deal of theoretical econometric                
              work in semiparametric and nonparametric estimates that converge               
              at or near parametric, root N rates.  These estimators generally               
              consist of estimating as finite number of parameters in the                    
              presence of an infinite dimensional nuisance parameter (the                    
              nonparametric component).  The goal is reasonably precise                      
              estimation and testing of parameters of interest while minimizing              
              or eliminating arbitrary function form restrictions.  This project             
              contributes to this body of econometric theory in ways that are                
              particularly relevant for empirical work.  The project applies the             
              theory empirically to a range of problems in consumer demand                   
              analysis.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              More specifically, the project has four closely interrelated parts:            
              1) Refining and extending existing techniques of estimating finite             
              dimensional expectations of unknown functions and their derivatives            
              at root N rates;                                                               
              2) Constructing moment based consistent, nonparametric hypothesis              
              tests of regression, density, or derivative constraints;                       
              3) Constructing a semiparametric, "no search," root N Converging               
              estimator of multiple linear index models that can handle discrete             
              as well as continuous regressors, and can deal with general forms              
              of heteroscedasticity including random coefficients;                           
              4)  Applying the above to nonparametric estimation of Slutsky                  
              substitution matrices, nonparametric testing of homogeneity and                
              Slutsky symmetry, semiparametric estimation of discrete or multiple            
              limited dependent variable choice models, and other cross sectional            
              demand applications.
