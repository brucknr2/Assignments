Abstract    :
              Threaded fasteners have found ubiquitous use in many systems and               
              structures. Although frequently overlooked, fasteners represent a              
              complex and often critical design element. To some extent, all                 
              fasteners are subjected to unsteady loading. Yet the behavior of               
              threaded fasteners under such conditions is still poorly                       
              understood. Existing analyses of threaded fasteners under                      
              vibration are based on static equilibrium conditions with                      
              supporting data limited to only low-frequency  conditions. Such                
              analyses suggest that only a net loosening action can occur.                   
              However, preliminary experiments show that when a broad range of               
              vibratory conditions are considered, alternate ranges of                       
              frequencies are found in which either a loosening or a tightening              
              action occurs. The goals of this research are to perform well-                 
              controlled measurements of the dynamic  forces and motions of                  
              threaded fasteners under a wide range of dynamic conditions and                
              to develop appropriate nonlinear dynamic models of threaded                    
              fasteners which capture and explain the dynamic loosening and                  
              tightening motions. The models will accommodate the interaction                
              of friction and vibration as well as the dynamic constraints and               
              nonlinearities inherent to threaded components. The results of                 
              the work are expected to be of fundamental engineering interest                
              and have immediate use in the design of joints in many critical                
              applications.***//
