Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The high metabolism of hummingbirds is fueled principally by the               
              sugar found in nectar, but consumed along with the sugar is an                 
              excess of water that can amount to several time the bird's own body            
              mass per day.  In hummingbirds, the kidney and the gastrointestinal            
              tract mush consequently play coordinated roles in the regulation of            
              water, electrolyte, and energy balance.  Beuchat describes a series            
              of experiments, including measurements of GFR and tubular water                
              reabsorption in the kidney, and of water and glucose absorption in             
              the intestine, that will isolate fundamental components of the                 
              mechanisms hummingbirds use to regulate energy, water, and                     
              electrolyte balance.  The project's focus on basic kidney function             
              and on the integration of renal with intestinal function in                    
              hummingbirds will provide fundamental information about the                    
              physiology of these animals.  In a broader perspective, this study             
              will be the first to closely examine the osmoregulatory physiology             
              of a bird or mammal that is a model organism for the study of                  
              chronic diuresis.  Finally, this study will be first in vivo test              
              of the hypothesis that paracellular fluid flux activated by Na+-               
              coupled glucose transport can play a significant role in nutrient              
              uptake in vertebrates.
