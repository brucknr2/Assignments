Abstract    :
              This proposal is to study the interaction of a protein tyrosine                
              kinase (pp60 src) and a putative substrate, p130. When naturally               
              occuring point mutations occur in pp60 src, resulting in pp60 v-               
              src, or when site-directed mutagenesis is performed, pp60 src                  
              becomes oncogenic. The pp60 src protein probably functions in                  
              cellular signal transduction as well as in cell transformation. The            
              p130 substrate protein will be purified, peptides from it will be              
              microsequenced, and a molecular clone encoding the protein will be             
              isolated. Interactions between these two proteins and a third                  
              protein (p110) will be examined to try to determine their roles in             
              src-mediated cell transformation and other cellular processes that             
              pp60 src is involved in. The importance of the src homology 2                  
              domain will be assessed; this domain is believed to be involved in             
              protein-protein interactions related to signal transduction.                   
              %%%                                                                            
              Cells contain a variety of enzymes (kinases) which can add                     
              phosphate residues to certain amino acids in susceptible proteins.             
              Protein tyrosine kinases have been implicated in transformation of             
              cells from normal growth to cancerous growth. The best studied of              
              this group is pp60 src. This proposal involves the interaction of              
              pp60 src with a putative substrate, p130, and will investigate the             
              events following their complex formation which result in cell                  
              transformation and signal transduction.
