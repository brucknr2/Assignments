Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This study will: 1) explore the generality of the natural sex-                 
              reversing ability of Hyperolius viridiflavus in the field.  A                  
              chromosomal analysis will attempt to determine the frequency of                
              sex-reversed individuals. 2) establish a breeding colony of these              
              frogs. 3) analyze plasma, gonad and larynx samples of the three                
              categories of animals (females, genetic and sex-reversed males) and            
              correlate circulating sec steroid levels to morphological and                  
              behavioral changes. 4) compare volumes of hypothalamic brain nuclei            
              of individuals in the three categories and in females treated with             
              testosterone and flutamide, an anti-androgen. 5) test the                      
              effectiveness of i.) group composition, ii.) exogenous testosterone            
              and flutamide and iii.) gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist and             
              antagonist in affecting sex-reversal in females housed in different            
              group situations. 6) record vocalizations of genetic and sex-                  
              reversed males, analyze the recording to determine if they differ,             
              and if so, initiate call playback experiments in the field to                  
              determine if females distinguish between the two.                              
                                                                                             
              The data obtained in this preliminary venture will provide a                   
              springboard to many future studies ranging from the neuroendocrine             
              to the evolutionary in scope.  This unique model system is sure to             
              provide new insights into mechanisms controlling sec at both the               
              proximate and ultimate levels.
