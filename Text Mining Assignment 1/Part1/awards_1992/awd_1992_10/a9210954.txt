Abstract    :
                   The purpose of this project is to design, prove, and implement            
              efficient distributed algorithms to perform a variety of network               
              computations securely and with high fault-tolerance.  The security of          
              interactive and distributed computations is a natural and extremely            
              relevant issue to the current, highly interconnected world.                    
              Computations distributed among several interacting processors provide          
              greater reliability and security than centralized computations, which          
              are prone to failure and malicious attacks.  Large networks can employ         
              redundancy to correct errors, and it is easier to ensure - and more            
              reasonable to believe - that a majority of processors are correct than         
              that a particular processor remains absolutely invulnerable.  The goal         
              is to replace centralized computers (name servers or authentication            
              servers, for example) by fast, interactive computations that obviate           
              the need to trust a given host.                                                
                   The project will prove the protocols secure and fault-tolerant            
              using a new set of formal methods the researcher has developed to              
              define and prove security in distributed systems.  These formal                
              methods capture intuition clearly, provide concise and modular proofs,         
              and have already been demonstrated useful in finding flaws in                  
              seemingly secure (and even published) protocols.                               
                   The project's standard of efficiency is stricter than just                
              requiring polynomial or polylogarithmic upper bounds.  The researcher          
              is implementing the protocols to judge their efficiency, to                    
              demonstrate their utility, and to determine the factors that are               
              relevant in an applied setting.
