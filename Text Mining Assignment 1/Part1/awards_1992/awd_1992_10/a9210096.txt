Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A central unresolved question in visual physiology and biochemistry            
              is:  How does light cause the creation of nerve signals in the                 
              retina?  This process is called "visual transduction."  Nerve                  
              signals generated during transduction are further processed and                
              encoded by higher-order cells in the retina and ultimately, in the             
              brain.  Exciting new developments in genetics, biochemistry, and               
              electrophysiology have made the Drosophila (fruit fly) visual                  
              system a new model preparation with which to examine visual                    
              transduction.  This elegantly simple experimental system promises              
              to yield rapid advances in our understanding of the physiology and             
              biochemistry of biological signalling.                                         
                                                                                             
              In particular, this research will offer a new scientific                       
              description of crucial intracellular events in visual transduction,            
              by studying the isolated photoreceptor preparation.  Using light-              
              induced introduction of calcium ions into the intracellular space              
              of a single photoreceptor will also enable a variety of significant            
              questions to be answered in this model preparation that will have              
              major significance for understanding the processes of visual                   
              transduction that occur, generally, in other species.
