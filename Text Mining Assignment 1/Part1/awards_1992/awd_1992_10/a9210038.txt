Abstract    :
                   This is a project to build and operate a Laser                            
              Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and to                    
              continue research and development of interferometric detectors                 
              of ever higher sensitivities.  The proposed LIGO includes                      
              interferometer installations of 4-km arm length and support                    
              facilities; these installations would be located at two widely                 
              separated sites in the continental United States and would                     
              operate in coincidence for the detection of gravitational                      
              waves.  The LIGO project is a joint effort of scientists at                    
              the California Institute of Technology and the Massachusetts                   
              Institute of Technology and includes collaborative programs                    
              with scientists at Stanford, University of Colorado, and other                 
              institutions.  The observatory will be operated as a user                      
              facility, open for use by the national community, and will                     
              become part of a planned worldwide network of gravitational-                   
              wave observatories.  The proposed LIGO is based on almost two                  
              decades of science research and development.  The ultimate                     
              objectives of the LIGO program include (1) tests of Einstein's                 
              General Theory of Relativity---in particular, measurement of                   
              the velocity and polarization of gravitational radiation and                   
              studies of the domain of highly nonlinear, dynamic gravity,                    
              and (2) the opening of an observational window on the universe                 
              that differs fundamentally from that provided by                               
              electromagnetic or particle astronomy.
