Abstract    :
              Research has found that auditors exhibit recency effects in                    
              revising initial beliefs or hypotheses.  This project will                     
              investigate factors which may moderate auditors' susceptibility to             
              order effects.  Research has also found that auditors are                      
              predisposed to focus on negative evidence as compared to positive              
              evidence.  These two effects may interact.  This project will test             
              the Belief Adjustment Model of Hogarth and Einhorn as a basis for              
              predictions about how recency effects can be eliminated or                     
              mitigated in settings in which auditors are highly sensitive to                
              negative information.  The study should provide insight regarding              
              the prevalence of order effects among professionals exposed to                 
              unique decision environments who may respond to risks in the                   
              decision setting by using adaptive belief revision strategies to               
              moderate the recency effects found in earlier research.  The                   
              results could then be used to develop procedures for improving the             
              quality of the decision process.
