Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                  This is a proposal to create a nationally representative                  
              Public Use Sample of the 1850 census of the free inhabitants of                
              the United States.  Public use samples already exist for the                   
              census years 1880, 1900, 1910, 1940, 1950, 1960, 1970, and 1980.               
                                                                                             
              The 1850 census is the first census of the United States which                 
              reported the characteristics of individuals rather than                        
              households.  The 1850 census file will not only constitute an                  
              invaluable resource in its own right, but will enhance the value               
                                                                                             
              of the other public use samples.  Used in combination, the nine                
              data sets spanning 130 years will comprise a most valuable                     
              resource for the study of social change.
