Abstract    :
              The development of a formal model relating the syntactic, semantic,            
              and discourse level analyses of texts will be investigated.  This              
              model will be organized around the notion of "discourse events"                
              which involve the creation, modification, or manipulation of the               
              propositional structure contributed by sentence constituents.                  
              Along with the development of the formal models, computational                 
              support for the analysis to texts in terms of the model will be                
              implemented.  With such support, a large collection of analyzed                
              texts and utterances will be accumulated.  The model will also                 
              serve as the specification for the design and implementation of                
              integrated natural language understanding programs.  The primary               
              methods to be employed will include unification based grammar                  
              formalisms and logic programming techniques.  The theoretical                  
              background for the approach will be based on the analysis of                   
              "speech acts" by Searle, the "projection semantics" of Halvorsen               
              and Kaplan, and the lexical functional" approach to grammar                    
              developed by Kaplan and Bresnan, as well as the techniques for                 
              implementing all of these, developed by the PI.  It is important               
              to understand the contributions that all linguist levels make to               
              the workings of texts.  The discourse events model is meant to                 
              serve as a way to organize the analysis of those contributions.
