Abstract    :
              This proposal is part of a systematic study of the Arctic                      
              environment and its role in global change which is promoted by                 
              NSF's Arctic System Science Program.  It is a three year project               
              utilize existing data sets and models in the evaluation heat and               
              salt transfer at the ice-water interface and to gain fundamental               
              insights into the roles of leads and thin ice in these processes.              
              A model for the distribution of shortwave energy in ice and lead               
              systems, combined with models of turbulent transfer in the upper               
              ocean, will be utilized in the analyses of existing data and to                
              quantify spatial and temporal variations in the flux of heat energy            
              from the Arctic Ocean to the sea ice within the Arctic Basin.                  
              Other simulations will explore the relationship between summer ice             
              conditions and mixed layer temperature, long-term implications of              
              seasonal variations in the flux of heat from the ocean to sea ice,             
              and possible situations that could lead to a disappearance of the              
              arctic ice pack.
