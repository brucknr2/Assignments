Abstract    :
              Issues surrounding the social security system in the U.S. have                 
              generated a large volume of academic research as well as wide                  
              public discussion.  When the system was first started, the main                
              public policy objective was to provide funds for consumption                   
              during old age.  Since then, economists and policy makers have                 
              raised concerns over the adverse effect of social security on                  
              private saving, its negative impact on the labor supply, the                   
              incentive it creates for early retirement, and the overall impact              
              on the lifetime welfare of individuals.  The purpose of this                   
              research is to develop and calibrate a dynamic, stochastic                     
              general equilibrium model to address issues like these concerning              
              the social security system.  The focus will be to estimate the                 
              quantitative impact of the social security system on lifetime                  
              welfare and on the capital stock under lifetime uncertainty,                   
              liquidity constraints, and individual income risk.  Numerical                  
              methods will be used to solve a finite horizon, dynamic                        
              programming problem and to computed competitive equilibria of the              
              model.  This research will result in useful new insights about                 
              designing an optimal social security system.
