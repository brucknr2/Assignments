                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                  The Cariban languages spoken in northern Brazil are among                 
              the least documented in the world, and many are in danger of                   
              extinction.  This project will collect documentary recordings of               
              as many northern Brazilian Cariban languages as possible and                   
              begin the process of transcribing word lists and grammatical                   
              information from these recordings.  The project will also provide              
              support for the Brazilian Cariban linguistics students to do                   
              intensive field work in three different northern Brazilian                     
              Cariban language communities.  The linguists will use traditional              
              field techniques, including recording, transcribing, and                       
              translating word lists and tests; syntactic analysis will be via               
              elicitation and analysis of transcribed texts.  For these three                
              languages, the project will produce analyses of phonology,                     
              morphology, basic syntax, and papers on theoretically or                       
              typologically relevant issues.  With these new data, the co-PI                 
              will work towards a more reliable classification of the Cariban                
              family and reconstruction of Proto Cariban lexicon and                         
              morphosyntax.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              This project is a collaborative effort, designed to help train                 
              new Brazilian linguists in basic linguistic description and                    
              historical/typological/functional approaches to linguistics.  It               
              will also be responsive to the needs of Cariban language                       
              communities, offering help in preserving their unique languages                
              and cultures.//
