Abstract    :
              This project will enable Dr Kathlyn Parker to advance her                      
              career by being a resident scholar in the Molecular and Cell                   
              Biology Program at Brown University. She will engage in a                      
              program of advanced study on ribosome function. The purpose is                 
              to invent new approaches to the chemistry of molecular biology.                
              Dr. Parker is a recognized leader in Synthetic Organic                         
              Chemistry. Experience in molecular biology will help focus her                 
              future research on important problems at the interface of                      
              chemistry and biology.

              This proposal builds a research program in the chmistry of                     
              moleular biology by a person who is a recognized expert in the                 
              synthesis of organic molecules. It will help to develop her                    
              career in an area with large potential impacts on human health                 
              and metabolism.
