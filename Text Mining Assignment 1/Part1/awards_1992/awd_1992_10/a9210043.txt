Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will develop numerical wavelet                 
              methods for multidimensional combustion applications.  The aim                 
              will be to determine the feasibility of using the advantages of                
              wavelet methods--data compression, multiresolution analysis and                
              orthogonality--to effectively address the numerical difficulties               
              of combustion applications, including significant features on                  
              multiple scales, strong nonlinearity, and moving boundaries or                 
              internal layers.  In particular, a preliminary study of the                    
              effectiveness of numerical wavelet methods for one dimensional                 
              deflagrations will be carried out as well as the design of                     
              numerical experiments to compare the effectiveness of wavelet                  
              methods to current discretization methods for significant                      
              multidimensionsal combustion applications.                                     
                   The necessity of limiting combustion caused environmental                 
              pollution and the transportation of combustible materials, for                 
              example, require an improved understanding of the combustion                   
              process.  These new numerical techniques offer new promise for                 
              such improved understanding.
