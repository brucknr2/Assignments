Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry at Purdue University will use this                 
              award from the Chemical Research Instrumentation Program to                    
              help acquire a state-of-the-art Electron Spin Resonance                        
              (ESR)/Spectrometer.  The areas of chemical research that will                  
              be enhanced by the acquisition include the following:                          
                                                                                             
              1.  EPR Studies of Copper Proteins.                                            
                                                                                             
              2.  Conducting Polymers in Zeolite Hosts-Design of                             
                  Electronic Nanostructures.                                                 
                                                                                             
              3.  EPR Studies of Biologically Relevant Metal Complexes                       
                                                                                             
              4.  Weak Carbon-Carbon Bonds.  The Characterization of                         
                  Diradical Triplet States and Mechanisms of Electron                        
                  Pair Coupling.                                                             
                                                                                             
              5.  EPR Studies of the Photosynthetic Apparatus.                               
                                                                                             
              Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) Spectroscopy is the primary                      
              technique for studying molecules which contain unpaired                        
              electrons.  An ESR spectrometer is useful in areas such as                     
              solid state chemistry, surface chemistry, solid state physics,                 
              electrochemistry, and material science.
