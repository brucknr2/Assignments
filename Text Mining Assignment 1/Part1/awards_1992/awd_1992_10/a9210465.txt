Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will carry out preliminary research as              
              a forerunner to a more thorough experimental study of Fe-Mg                    
              diffusion in olivine. The research will be significant in                      
              understanding changes in diffusion mechanism as a function of                  
              temperature.
