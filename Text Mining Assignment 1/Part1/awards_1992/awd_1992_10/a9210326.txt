Abstract    :
                   The project will investigate the physical principle underlying            
              the plasma-assisted laser deposition process for the in situ growth            
              of high critical temperature superconducting thin films on a                   
              substrate.  An understanding of the physical mechanisms governing              
              the process are critical for reproducible thin film deposition on              
              a low temperature substrate and subsequent integration into                    
              existing semiconductor technologies.                                           
                   The successful modeling and control of the deposition process             
              may allow the manufacture of superconducting thin films with the               
              consistent properties that are needed to produce devices that are              
              of practical usefulness.
