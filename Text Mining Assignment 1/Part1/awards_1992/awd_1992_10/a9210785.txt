Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              One important aspect of brain development is the generation of sex-            
              specific neurons that are involved in the regulation of sex-                   
              specific behaviors, hormonal controls and reproduction.  The                   
              development of male-specific and female-specific neurons will be               
              studied in the fruitfly, an organism optimal for elucidating the               
              genetic and molecular events underlying the development of neuronal            
              fate.  Immunohistochemistry and neuronal tracing techniques will be            
              used to isolate and characterize male-specific and female-specific             
              neurons in the nervous systems of both sexes.  The effects of                  
              mutations on the commitment of neurons to a sex-specific fate and              
              the maintenance of this decision will also be studied.  These                  
              studies will provide fundamental information on genes involved in              
              the generation of neuronal diversity in the brain.
