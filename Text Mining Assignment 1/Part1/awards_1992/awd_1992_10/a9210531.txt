Abstract    :
              Under a Research Initiation Award contact mechanics and stress                 
              analysis techniques will be used to analyze repeated abrasive                  
              contacts of ceramic materials.  The generation and evolution of                
              plastic zones and microcracks will be modeled as many microevents              
              of sharp sliding indentation.  The combined results will be used               
              to develop a predictive model for abrasive wear of ceramic                     
              materials.
