Abstract    :
                   In many real world systems, they are of such complexity that              
              the functional relationship between the parameters of the system               
              and its performance is not well understood.  Simulation is often               
              the only tool that can be used to evaluate the performance of the              
              system.  Standard mathematical programming techniques cannot be                
              used to optimize the performance of the system.  This project will             
              conduct research aimed at developing efficient methods for                     
              optimizing the performance of stochastic system with respect to                
              continuous decision variables.  The project is concerned with three            
              issues:  1) under what conditions do several new stochastic                    
              approximation algorithms converge,  2) when are these conditions               
              satisfied in simulation, and 3) how do stochastic approximation                
              algorithms compare empirically?
