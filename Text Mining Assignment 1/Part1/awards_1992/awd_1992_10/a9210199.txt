Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to                                            
              advance the understanding of viscous                                           
              fingering in fixed beds.  Viscous                                              
              fingering will be monitored in situ                                            
              in operating columns using magnetic                                            
              resonance imaging (MRI).  Advanced                                             
              MRI techniques will also be employed                                           
              for direct measurements of fingering                                           
              during multicomponent separations,                                             
              and of intraparticle convection and                                            
              nonuniform dispersion.  Finger                                                 
              behavior will be compared with                                                 
              theoretical predictions obtained by                                            
              linear stability analysis.
