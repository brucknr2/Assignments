Abstract    :
              This project will investigate methods of controlling defect                    
              densities, specifically those of stacking faults and their                     
              associated defects, during the synthesis of YBCO thin films.  TEM              
              and x-ray diffraction will be used to characterize the                         
              microstructures.  Thin film will be deposited using off-axis                   
              magnetron sputter deposition.  Multilayering will be some of the               
              techniques used to control the densities of nonstoichiometric                  
              stacking faults.  Microstrutures will be correlated with variations            
              in transport properties.                                                       
              %%%%                                                                           
              This project aims to correlate the critical currents with defect               
              densities of the YBCO thin films.  Correlations between the                    
              microstructures with variations in the transport properties will               
              provide better understanding about questions concerning vortex                 
              dynamics and vortex lattice melting.  Improvements in the                      
              performance of these films can be expected with this kind of                   
              understanding.
