Abstract    :
              Performance of computer vision algorithms is contingent upon the               
              quality of the input.  With uncorrupted data most of the                       
              algorithms perform well, however, once noise is present the                    
              results may become unreliable.  The noise can appear as                        
              uncertainty about the input and/or incorrect assumptions about                 
              the underlying model structure.  A robust computer vision                      
              algorithm should tolerate both types of noise.  The methods                    
              borrowed from statistics or estimation theory were not designed                
              for visual data where resistance to data uncertainty and                       
              tolerance of incorrect assumptions are of paramount importance.                
              Good performance for noisy visual data can only be achieved                    
              through robust detection of the consensus among the outputs of a               
              large number of identical non-robust processes, with a                         
              methodology called the Consensus Paradigm.  A similarity exist                 
              between the computational steps of recently proposed 3D object                 
              recognition algorithms and the robust estimation methods.  The                 
              research will exploit this similarity and develop object                       
              recognition algorithms with improved noise resistance.  Results                
              of the research will contribute to the development of techniques               
              for autonomous decision making in unfamiliar visual environments.
