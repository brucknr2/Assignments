Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project calls for new research to resolve an outstanding                  
              controversy in corporate finance: how important were tax                       
              considerations in motivating corporate mergers in the early 1980s?             
              This issue is of interest to both public finance and financial                 
              economists, and the existing empirical evidence is contradictory.              
              This study will collect additional data on the share prices of                 
              acquired and acquiring firms, and investigate the details of the               
              merger transactions.  This project will yield interesting empirical            
              results on the takeover process.                                               
                                                                                             
              Specifically, the project will address the following questions.                
              (1) Does the market reward bidders who successfully capture tax                
              benefits?  Does the market penalize bidders who fail to optimize               
              the tax consequences of acquisitions?  (2) When a bidder fails to              
              capture tax benefits, is there systematic evidence that the                    
              acquisition is motivated by other potential gains?  (3) Are firms              
              with loss/credit carryforwards less likely to be taken over after              
              the Tax Reform Act of 1986?  (4) Are target firms with tax                     
              attributes that would have generated tax savings prior to the Tax              
              Reform Act of 1986 offered lower premia after the Tax Reform Act               
              of 1986?  Questions 3 and 4 were prompted by the fact that the Tax             
              Reform Act of 1986 effectively eliminated the two main sources of              
              acquisition tax gains - abolishing the benefits from writing up the            
              basis of target assets to their market values and severely                     
              restricting the merged firm's ability to offset taxable income with            
              target loss/credit carryforwards.
