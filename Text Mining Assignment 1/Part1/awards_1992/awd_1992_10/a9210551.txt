Abstract    :
              Recently, industrial and academic                                              
              researchers have developed a keen                                              
              interest in complex composite                                                  
              materials since they can exhibit                                               
              unusual and, when properly designed,                                           
              beneficial electromagnetic                                                     
              properties.  An example of this is                                             
              a chiral, or optically active,                                                 
              material which macroscopically is a                                            
              large collection of tiny, handed

              research project is the development                                            
              of a deterministic capability for

              crucial in the design of these
