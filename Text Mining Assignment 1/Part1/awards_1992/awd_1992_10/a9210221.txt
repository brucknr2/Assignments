Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Cytokinins are thought to play a central role in controlling plant             
              growth and development.  They are essential for cell division and              
              organogenesis in tissue culture, they can influence chloroplast                
              development, delay senescence in detached tissues, and cause                   
              outgrowth of lateral buds.  Despite these impressive effects,                  
              little is known about how cytokinins act.                                      
                                                                                             
              The long-term research goal is to understand how the cytokinin                 
              signal is perceived and transduced in the plant.  Two approaches               
              will be used: (1) Arabidopsis thaliana cytokinin-insensitive                   
              mutants will be identified.  Because many interesting mutations                
              might be lethal, screening will be conducted so that lethal                    
              recessive mutations can be retrieved as heterozygotes.  Obtaining              
              such mutants will enable future cloning of a gene involved in the              
              cytokinin-response pathway. (2) Regulation of gene expression by               
              cytokinins will be analyzed.  One of the most dramatic and                     
              accessible effects of cytokinins is their ability to overcome                  
              apical dominance and cause outgrowth of lateral buds.  Genes whose             
              expression is induced within 6 hours of cytokinin treatment of                 
              tomato lateral buds will be cloned.  Whether cytokinins control                
              gene transcription or post-transcriptional processes will be                   
              determined.  These experiments will produce the tools necessary for            
              identifying cellular factors that control gene expression in                   
              response to cytokinins.
