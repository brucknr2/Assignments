Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Funded by a Research Planning Grant, details are to be                         
              determined for an experimental investigation of non-linear                     
              water waves in a water tank driven by longitudinal                             
              oscillations. Resonance effects, interaction between various                   
              wave modes, and comparison of experimental data to existing                    
              models and an improved model, will be the main thrusts of the                  
              investigation.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              Certain inconsistencies between existing measurements and                      
              experimental data remain as an impediment to the confident                     
              application of theory to predict the interaction of non-linear                 
              waves with each other and with man-made structures.
