Abstract    :
              This research planning grant will enable Dr Leslie Lyons to                    
              initiate a research program on the correlation of structure and                
              ionic conductivity in amorphous polymers. Systematic                           
              composition studies will be undertaken on the ionic                            
              conductivity  of polymer salt complexes prepared from amorphous                
              polymers. Molecular weight determinations will be performed                    
              using  high pressure liquid chromatography and size exclusion                  
              techniques. The long term goal is to address the issue of ion                  
              pairing in polymer salt complexes.

              Research Planning Grants are awarded to women who have not yet                 
              been awarded federal funding for their research. Dr Lyons is a                 
              professor at Grinnell College and is initiating a program in                   
              the electrical conduction properties of polymers. Results of                   
              her work could lead to commercially important plastics which                   
              have unique electrical properties.
