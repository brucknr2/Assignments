Abstract    :
              The objective is a bedload transport model for the channels                    
              and rivers.  The following problems will be addressed:                         
              bedload transport of mixtures, bedload-induced roughness,                      
              boundary conditions for suspended sediment computations,                       
              transverse bedload transport, and transition from bedload into                 
              suspension.  A Lagrangian treatment of saltating particles,                    
              which includes both a deterministic component (particle                        
              trajectory) and a stochastic component (collision and splash),                 
              will be used.  Computer simulations will be conducted to                       
              investigate the effect of particle-fluid and particle-bed                      
              interactions.  Flow visualization with a high-speed video                      
              recording system will be used for experimental verification.                   
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
              The mechanics-based bedload transport relation proposed in                     
              this project provides an improved approach to assess                           
              environmental flow problems in which reliable sediment                         
              transport prediction are needed.
