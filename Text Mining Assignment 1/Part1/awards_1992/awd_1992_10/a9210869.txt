Abstract    :
              This is an award to support research on a                                      
              comprehensive modeling approach for                                            
              predicting metal ion sorption over the range                                   
              of solid to solution ratios found in natural                                   
              environmental systems.  The model must be                                      
              capable of predicting the distribution of                                      
              surface complexes as a function of solids                                      
              concentration and pH and should incorporate                                    
              the effects of particle interactions on                                        
              sorption phenomena.  X-Ray absorption                                          
              spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy will                                  
              be used to determine the structure of surface                                  
              complexes as a function of solids                                              
              concentration in batch and recirculating                                       
              batch reactors.  The proposal leading to this                                  
              award was submitted in response to NSF 88-99                                   
              as modified by changes dated 09/19/91 to make                                  
              the Research Initiation Award announcement                                     
              consistent with changes in NSF 83-57 and                                       
              published as NSF 90-77.                                                        
                                                                                             
              Many environmental problems associated with                                    
              energy and raw material production require                                     
              reliable quantitative prediction of the                                        
              transport and dispersion of contaminants in                                    
              surface and groundwater systems.  Reaction of                                  
              contaminant solutes with mineral surfaces in                                   
              soils, sediments, and rocks typically causes                                   
              a portion of each solute to partition onto                                     
              the solids.  This sorption decreases solute                                    
              mobility, which must be accounted for in                                       
              transport models.  Results of this research                                    
              are expected to be used to formulate surface                                   
              complexation reactions and the resulting                                       
              model will be used to simulate the sorption                                    
              behavior of metal ions in column reactors                                      
              used in design of environmental pollution
