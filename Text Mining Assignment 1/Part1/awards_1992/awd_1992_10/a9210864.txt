Abstract    :
                   This research centers on developing a new class of delay                  
              estimation architectures that can align two pseudonoise (PN) code              
              generators without resorting to serial search techniques. This is              
              a significant deviation from conventional methods of PN code                   
              synchronization and promises to significantly reduce the                       
              complexity and improve the performance of these subsystems. The                
              new  architecture is constructed by inserting a filter                         
              between the local waveform generator and crosscorrelation                      
              multiplier of a conventional correlation loop. The produces a new              
              class of control loops that can generate useful error signals                  
              over a much wider range of timing errors than conventional loops,              
              such as delay locked loops and tau dither loops. The new device                
              promises to be particularly effective at low signal to noise                   
              ratios and in hostile environments where conventional loops                    
              frequently loose lock and then re-acquire the signal. The goal of              
              this research is to fully develop the proposed architecture,                   
              determine its performance in a wide variety of environments, and               
              investigate the feasibility of implementing the devices with                   
              currently available technology.  Potential applications include                
              improved Global Positioning System receivers, enhanced code                    
              division multiple access (CDMA) radio networks (including mobile               
              telephone CDMA systems),  and improvements in a variety of                     
              military and commercial spread spectrum systems.
