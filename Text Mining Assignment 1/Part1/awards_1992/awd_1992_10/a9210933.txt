Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research project addresses a central issue in the                         
              cell biology of vision and photoreception:  the                                
              mechanisms and significance of turnover of light-                              
              sensitive membrane and its constituent light-sensitive                         
              molecule (rhodopsin).  The assembly of light-sensitive                         
              membranes in light receptors are being studied in the                          
              normal and also in the vitamin-A deprived condition.                           
              Intracellular membranes that serve as the precursors of                        
              photosensitive membranes accumulate as large masses                            
              within vitamin-A deficient photoreceptors.  When such                          
              cells are exposed to very bright light that compensates                        
              for their relative insensitivity, the internal membrane                        
              is rapidly added to the light-sensitive membrane.                              
                                                                                             
              This laboratory also is testing an hypothesis concerning                       
              the relationship between the biochemical pathway that is                       
              involved in the response to light and the regulation of                        
              assembly and degradation of the light-sensitive membrane                       
              in photoreceptors. Techniques being used include                               
              pharmacological agents that specifically mimic various                         
              steps in the biochemical pathway.  The structural effects                      
              of these agents on photoreceptor cells will be studied                         
              with electron microscopy.  Functional effects will be                          
              assessed with electrophysiological methods.  The pathway                       
              by which vitamin A derivatives enter and are utilized by                       
              the retina to provide the light-sensitive molecules for                        
              photoreception is also being investigated.
