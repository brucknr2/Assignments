Abstract    :
              Several topics concerning parallel and distributed computing will be           
              investigated.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              1.  Assignment and Scheduling of Precedence Graphs:  The existing              
              parallel compilers for supercomputers rely heavily on the programmer           
              for running an application.  By gaining a better understanding of              
              assignment and scheduling issues, much of this process can be                  
              automated.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              2.  Sparse Certificates and Communication Networks:  Sparse                    
              certificates for graph connectivity (highly connected spanning                 
              subgraphs with relatively few edges) have been introduced as a useful          
              tool for communication networks.  Certificates for weighted graphs and         
              their utility in the design of reliable protocols will be explored.            
              These certificates, if employed properly in communication protocols,           
              could result in considerable savings in the amount of message traffic          
              generated.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              3.  Algorithms for Graph Connectivity:  A recent almost-linear time            
              algorithm for edge connectivity based on matroid theory will be used           
              to investigate questions pertaining to the vertex connectivity graphs          
              and digraphs, and the complexity of connectivity testing on parallel           
              and distributed models.  Efficient reductions and parallelizable               
              alternate methods will be considered as ways of solving these                  
              problems.
