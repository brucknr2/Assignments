Abstract    :
              The techniques of computational                                                
              chemistry have found wide                                                      
              interdisciplinary application in                                               
              fields as diverse as polymer

              The purpose of this preliminary                                                
              study is to adapt the methodology                                              
              of Quantum Chemistry to investigate                                            
              electronic properties of zero-
