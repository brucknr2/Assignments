Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In order to understand how the brain analyzes visual information, it           
              is essential to study the details of connections that are made                 
              between the eye and brain.  The present research seeks to understand           
              this circuitry by analyzing retinal ganglion-cell anatomy in                   
              relation to their electrophysiological properties and the type of              
              connections they establish in the midbrain.                                    
                                                                                             
              Single optic-nerve axon staining methods are used to reveal the                
              detailed anatomy of neurons that form connections between the eye              
              and the brain.  Once such connections are fully understood, it will            
              be possible to determine how these connections may change following            
              injury.  These experiments will also provide information about the             
              ability of nerves to regenerate functional connections following               
              injury to the optic nerve.
