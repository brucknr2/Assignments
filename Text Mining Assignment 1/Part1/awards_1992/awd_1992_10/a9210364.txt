Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Conference on the Biology of Ultraviolet Light                            
              Reception  will be held in association with the annual                         
              meeting of the American Society of Zoologists.  A number                       
              of species, both invertebrate and vertebrate have been                         
              shown to have photosensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) light.                      
              During the conference, leading researchers in this area                        
              of visual science will address the way in which UV light                       
              is received and processed, the morphology and                                  
              distribution of UV-sensitive cells and the                                     
              characteristics of the photosensitive pigment in these                         
              cells, the relationship between UV sensitivity, polarized                      
              light sensitivity and color vision as well as the                              
              behavioral responses to UV stimuli and the ecological                          
              significance of UV light reception.                                            
                                                                                             
              The interactions between leading researchers in this                           
              field that occur at the conference should generate new                         
              ideas, suggest novel lines of investigation and produce                        
              a more integrated approach to understanding this unusual                       
              sensory capability.  The published material generated                          
              from the conference will be of interest to  scientists                         
              working on a wide range of subjects in visual                                  
              neuroscience, ecology and animal behavior.
