Abstract    :
              This career Advancement Award will enable Dr. Marjatta Lyyra to                
              establish and develop her career in cluster research. She will                 
              construct a time of flight mass spectrometry facility capable                  
              of gas phase cluster work. She will use the equipment to study                 
              bound-bound spectroscopy, the dynamics of photodissociation,                   
              and collisional energy transfer. Hydrogen cluster ion systems                  
              will be studied in the initial work. Subsequently fullerenenes                 
              which are hosts for metal ions will be investigated.

              This award will enable a productive scientist to build                         
              scientific equipment which can measure properties that will                    
              lead to a better understanding of chemical reactions. The                      
              systems she will study are important to the development of new                 
              kinds of materials which could have electrical and catalytic                   
              properties of industrial importance.
