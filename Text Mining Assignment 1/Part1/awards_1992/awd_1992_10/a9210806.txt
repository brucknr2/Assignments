Abstract    :
                   This research planning grant supports the research of                     
              Professor Christ to study the Stark-Hamiltonian with random                    
              potentials  over the real numbers. In particular she will study the            
              spectrum of the Stark-Hamiltonian and their resonances.                        
                   Modern physics, quantum mechanics and relativity, is a product            
              of the twentieth century.  It is founded firmly in the last                    
              century's attempt to address the microstructure of matter and to               
              come to grips with the concepts of action-at-a distance, electro-              
              magnetism, and heat radiation.  The mathematical foundations for               
              these developments, collectively called mathematical physics,                  
              ranges from detailed analysis of Schrodinger operators, which                  
              governs the dynamics of particles, to unified field theory, which              
              attempts to unite the four known forces into a single theory.
