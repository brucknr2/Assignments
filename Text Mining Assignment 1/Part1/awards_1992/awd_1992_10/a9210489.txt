Abstract    :
                   One source of difficulty for time dependent problems for                  
              composites is the presence of an additional length scale in the                
              form of frequency or time of observation.  The goal of this                    
              project is to obtain a cogent description of the response of                   
              composites to time-dependent loadings and to arrive at effective               
              medium theories which give a macroscopic description of the                    
              response.  In this phase of this continuing research, the                      
              emphasis will be on those cases where the interaction of the                   
              stress and displacement field in the composite with the boundary               
              is expected to be strong.  Of interest is the description of                   
              boundary layer-type phenomena, and their influence on the                      
              macroscopic behavior of the composite.  The tools used will be a               
              combination of asymptotic analysis, analytical methods for                     
              partial differential equations, and numerical experimentation.                 
              The eventual goal is to arrive at accurate and efficiently                     
              computable models of wave propagation in, and vibration of,                    
              composite structures.                                                          
                   Composite materials are now commonplace building materials,               
              especially in high-tech applications, therefore it is important                
              to know their mechanical properties.  The goal of this research                
              project is to build on the knowledge-base on the mechanical                    
              properties of composites, with particular emphasis on their                    
              dynamic behavior.
