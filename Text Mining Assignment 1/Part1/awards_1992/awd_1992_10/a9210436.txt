Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Funded through a Research Initiation Award, experimental and                   
              theoretical research will be carried out on the effect of                      
              boundary roughness on the transition of boundary layer flow to                 
              turbulence.  The effect of both isolated and distributed                       
              roughness elements will be explored, in two and three                          
              dimensions.  The focus is on a mechanism called Bypass                         
              Transition.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              The occurrence and cause of turbulence in engineering flow                     
              systems is widespread and still not sufficiently understood to                 
              permit reliable engineering predictions.
