Abstract    :
              Risk is a central fact of life in the rural areas of less                      
              developed countries.  There is a vast, mainly theoretical                      
              literature that explores the consequences of risk for individual               
              behavior and the evolution of institutions.  In the absence of                 
              complete insurance markets, households utilize a variety of                    
              economic strategies in order to mitigate the consequences of                   
              risk.  The purpose of this project is to analyze the joint saving              
              and credit market decisions made by households as they attempt to              
              cope with risk in a social setting characterized by an important,              
              but incomplete mutual insurance network in northern Nigeria.                   
              Saving and credit transactions take on a special role when                     
              insurance markets are incomplete by allowing households to smooth              
              their consumption streams in the face of random income                         
              fluctuations.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              This issue will be analyzed using data collected in a nine-round               
              survey of the region in 1988-1989.  This rich data set will                    
              permit an investigation of the ex post strategies adopted by                   
              households in response to the recent receipt of random shocks.                 
              The analysis will be based on joint estimation of the effect of                
              random shocks on net asset sales and net borrowing, taking into                
              account the structure of the credit market revealed in earlier                 
              work.  An understanding of the magnitude of the consumption-                   
              smoothing motivation for asset accumulation is a prerequisite for              
              a more general analysis of the level and composition of rural                  
              investment.  In addition, the findings should contribute to                    
              current discussions regarding interventions designed to reduce                 
              the vulnerability of households to drought.
