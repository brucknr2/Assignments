Abstract    :
                   Queueing theory has long been an important area of applied                
              probability.  Realistic applications require fairly complex                    
              systems.  In particular arrivals to a single queue may come from a             
              number of different distributions.  These can be modeled as a                  
              superposition of point processes.  This research is designed to                
              identify and solve the important problems in applying this type of             
              model to communication systems.                                                
                   Problems in communications can often be solved by studying                
              appropriate probability models.  This research is designed to                  
              identify such problems and solve them by using the appropriate                 
              probability models.
