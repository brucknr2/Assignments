Abstract    :
                   The eventual goal of this project is to develop a theory of               
              discourse representation for generating narrative texts.  A                    
              discourse representation for text generation (in contrast to                   
              understanding) must not only account for phenomena such as                     
              anaphoric reference and rhetorical relations among constituents, it            
              must also address the problem of how the text is constructed from              
              an underlying semantic representation.  Furthermore, the                       
              representation should account for textual variation and constrain              
              the decision making of the text planner.  An essential aspect of               
              the project will be to implement the theory in a generation system.            
              Implementing not only strengthens the theory, since it must address            
              a wider range of problems more concretely, but also provides a                 
              means of evaluating the results.  Evaluation in the context of text            
              generation can be done relatively easily, since the output is                  
              English text, which can be read and easily judged by people outside            
              the project.
