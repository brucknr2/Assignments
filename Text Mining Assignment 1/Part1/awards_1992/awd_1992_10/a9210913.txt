Abstract    :
              New strategies for compiling large numerical programs will be explored         
              in this research.  The use of hierarchical control flow graphs to              
              facilitate fast information propagation will be the major technique            
              employed.  This will exploit hierarchies in program control thus               
              allowing automatic parallelization in high performance computing. A            
              new compiler will be developed in order to demonstrate the                     
              significance of this approach.
