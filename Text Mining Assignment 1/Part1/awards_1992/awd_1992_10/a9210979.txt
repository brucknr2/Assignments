Abstract    :
                   Network design encompasses an array of problems as diverse as             
              vehicle routing, facility location, and telecommunications.                    
              Problems in this area naturally fall into two types:  capacitated              
              and uncapacitated, according to whether potential edges in (or                 
              flows through) the network are capacitated.  While uncapacitated               
              network design problems are well studied and reasonably tractable,             
              capacitated problems seem to be considerably more difficult, in                
              part because good integer programming formulations for them are                
              largely unknown.                                                               
                   This research will focus on an important network design                   
              model, the problem of designing a centralized processing network.              
              This research will focus on the development and implementation of              
              cutting-plan algorithms, based on linear programming, for several              
              variants of this problem.
