Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Ciliary neurotrophic factor, CNTF, is a protein known to promote               
              survival and differentiation of specific classes of neurons grown              
              in culture, as well as to affect the development of glial cells.               
              The basic molecular mechanisms for the effects of CNTF are not                 
              known.  A simple, easily accessible system, human neuroblastoma                
              tumor cells, will be used to identify CNTF receptors.  In addition,            
              a pharmacological approach will be taken to characterize the                   
              intracellular mechanisms involved in transducing the CNTF signal to            
              affect cell physiology.  The regulation of CNTF receptors by                   
              neurotransmitters and ion channel ligands, as well as during                   
              phorbol ester induced cell differentiation will also be studied.               
              These studies promise to provide fundamental knowledge about                   
              factors crucial to the development, survival, regeneration and                 
              aging of specific types of cells in the nervous system.
