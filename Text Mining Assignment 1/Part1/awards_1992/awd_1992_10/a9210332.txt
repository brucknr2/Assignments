Abstract    :
                Recently, there has been a significant increase in the use of                
              techniques from applied Artificial Intelligence (AI) such as                   
              expert systems to implement the control functions for complex                  
              industrial processes.  The research funded is showing that the                 
              design of such expert controllers (controllers implemented via                 
              expert systems) can be accomplished using the same design                      
              philosophy as that used for fuzzy controllers.  Moreover, to                   
              ensure that such expert controllers can be trusted in critical                 
              environments (e.g., aircraft control, spacecraft control, process              
              control) this research is developing a discrete event system                   
              (DES) theoretic framework for the modeling and analysis of expert              
              control systems.  In particular, a mathematical model is                       
              introduced that can represent "rule-based" expert systems and a                
              wide class of processes.  Techniques from DES theory are being                 
              developed for the analysis of reachability (to study inference                 
              chains), cyclic behavior (to verify that the expert system will                
              not get stuck in circular reasoning), and stability properties                 
              (to verify critical properties related to the safe operation of                
              expert control systems).  The application of the approach to the               
              solution of a load balancing problem in flexible manufacturing                 
              systems and process control problems is being investigated.                    
              Moreover, implementation issues for expert controllers are being               
              investigated via the implementation of an expert controller for a              
              flexible link manipulator.//
