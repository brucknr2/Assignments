Abstract    :
              This study concerns the use of excimer lasers in the thermal                   
              processing of materials, a technique which can be advantageous                 
              in device micro-fabrication. Micro-machining can be achieved                   
              by localized ablation and evaporative material removal caused                  
              by high powered laser beams. Excimer laser light irradiation                   
              can yield submicron pattern dimensions. The development of the                 
              technique to a reliable technology depends on the fundamental                  
              development of the physics of the material removal process.                    
              The primary objectives of this project are: (1) To                             
              experimentally analyze the material removal mechanisms by (a)                  
              in situ transient optical measurements, (b) post processing                    
              analysis using SEM, TEM, and X-ray diffraction. (2) To                         
              theoretically model the material removal process. (3) To                       
              optimize the process parameters toward the achievement of                      
              defect-free submicron patterns in metallic and semi-conductor                  
              layers.
