Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is a study of the Townsend movement which worked to                  
              secure pensions for the aged in the Depression.  The Townsend                  
              movement may have included as many as one-fifth of the aged at                 
              the start of 1936.  The study will examine how the Townsend                    
              movement grew and spread throughout the United States, and it                  
              will examine what effects this movement may have had on                        
              public spending for old people.  The study will use statistical                
              methods to analyze data collected from historical archives around              
              the country and from polling data about the strengths of the                   
              Townsend movement and other movements trying to gain support for               
              pensions for the aged.                                                         
                   The study's focus on the outcomes of a popular social                     
              movement, such as the Townsend movement, is one of the strengths               
              of the study.  Another strength is its combination of good                     
              history with systematic quantitative analysis.
