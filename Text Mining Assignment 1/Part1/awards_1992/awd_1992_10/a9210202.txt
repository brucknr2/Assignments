Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is a study of the dynamics of organizational                         
              concentration over time.  A highly concentrated organizational                 
              population is one which is dominated by a few very large                       
              organizations while low concentration is defined as a population               
              of organizations with many small units.  This study will examine               
              the effects of founding, failure, and growth rates on changes in               
              concentration over time.  The study will employ event history                  
              models to analyze data the founding, growth, and decline of life               
              insurance companies in New York and Arizona.                                   
                   One of the major contributions of this study will be to                   
              further our understanding of the social and economic processes                 
              leading to the development of monopolies in some industries,                   
              while others are characterized by many small organizations or                  
              firms.  Another contribution will be to show directly how the                  
              engine of change in the size distribution of organizations                     
              consist of organizational creation, failure, and growth rates.
