Abstract    :
                   The Florida State University Nuclear Research Laboratory                  
              will operate a tandem van de Graaff accelerator and                            
              superconducting linac booster accelerator for low energy                       
              nuclear structure studies.  The structure of nuclei at high                    
              spin will be studied with a new array of Compton-suppressed                    
              gamma ray detectors to explore the relation between single-                    
              particle and collective degrees of freedom, including                          
              superdeformation.  Spin dependent effects in reactions will be                 
              studied using polarized ions made possible by a laser-pumped                   
              ion source.  High spin and high excitation energy states will                  
              be studied via resonant particle decay spectroscopy.                           
              Collective octupole states and nuclei with permanent octupole                  
              deformation will be studied in the medium to heavy nuclei                      
              region.  Appropriate instrumentation will be developed for                     
              this work, including a superconducting conversion electron                     
              spectrometer.  The effects of incomplete fusion on heavy ion                   
              induced fission reactions will also be studied using a Bragg                   
              curve spectrometer to identify charge states.  Planning will                   
              occur for a radioactive beam capability.  Some low energy                      
              studies using specialized national facilities will also                        
              continue: at Argonne's APEX detector and at the GAMMASPHERE                    
              facility at Berkeley.  High energy nuclear research will                       
              continue at a number of other labs including CEBAF and RHIC.
