Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Elasmobranch fishes (sharks, skates and rays) have an extremely                
              sensitive and specialized sensory system that is critical for the              
              detection of weak electric fields in their marine environments.                
              This sense is used in finding prey and in orientation.  A                      
              significant problem is that the fish's own activities such as                  
              swimming and respiration, stimulate these electroreceptors.                    
              Therefore, mechanisms must exist within the brain for separating               
              responses to important external electric fields as distinct from               
              this self-generated "noise".  Previous experiments from this                   
              laboratory have shown that such a process is accomplished in the               
              first stages of sensory information-processing in the hindbrain                
              region.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              A series of physiological and anatomical studies are being conducted           
              to better understand the mechanisms responsible for this noise-                
              reduction process.  In general, separating signal information from             
              noise is a problem that has broad significance for understanding how           
              all vertebrate sensory systems operate.  Therefore, the results                
              obtained from these experiments are relevant for other sensory                 
              systems in all vertebrates species, including humans.
