Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The growth and reproduction of insects is controlled by hormones               
              released from the endocrine glands.  These glands are, in turn,                
              controlled by specific neuropeptides produced in small groups of               
              cells in the brain.  Molecular genetics and DNA cloning methods                
              will be used to investigate the control of production and the                  
              functions of one of these neuropeptides, named PTTH                            
              (prothoracicotropic hormones).  The studies will be carried out                
              using the fruitfly Drosophila, which is the organism of choice for             
              molecular genetic studies.  The idea that PTTH controls the                    
              production of molting hormone will be tested by determining the                
              levels of PTTH and molting hormone at different developmental                  
              stages and in insects affected by mutations that perturb growth.               
              The PTTH gene will be cloned, and synthetic PTTH derived from the              
              cloned gene will be used in experiments to investigate how PTTH                
              controls its target organ, the prothoracic gland, Genetic                      
              techniques will be used to disrupt the PTTH gene in order to                   
              identify all of the processes that it controls.  The results of                
              these studies promise to extend our understanding of the hormonal              
              control of insect growth and lead to novel strategies for designing            
              new insect control agents.  In addition, they will provide a new               
              way of investigating the basic neurohormonal mechanisms underlying             
              control of reproduction in other organisms including man.
