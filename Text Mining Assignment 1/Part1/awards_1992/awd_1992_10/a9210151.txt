Abstract    :
                   Software environments to aid in the prototyping of protocols and          
              distributed algorithms are increasingly important as networking                
              expands.  Powerful techniques for specification and validation are             
              needed.  A prototyping environment called SPANNER, based on a coupled          
              finite state machine model, was shown to be useful for precisely               
              specifying and validating small coordination problems.  This award             
              explores the development of a more powerful development environment by         
              extending the specification capabilities of the SPANNER system and by          
              implementing a distributed version of the enhanced system.  The                
              specification capabilities are being enhanced by allowing dynamic              
              activation of modules, constraint-based specifications, and multiple           
              time bases.  The goal is to continue to be able to validate such               
              specifications for safety and liveness properties.  The distributed            
              implementation is designed to be able to validate larger and more              
              complex protocols in a shorter amount of time.  The ideas being                
              developed and tested during the course of this work should be of use           
              to prototyping environments developed by other researchers.
