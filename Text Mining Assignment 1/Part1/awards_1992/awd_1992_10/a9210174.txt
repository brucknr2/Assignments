Abstract    :
              This is an award to support planning for research on                           
              factors controlling surfactant enhanced extraction of                          
              halogenated organic substances from groundwater aquifers.                      
              The work consists of selection of organic liquids and                          
              surfactants to be evaluated, determination of solubilities                     
              and interfacial tensions of the liquids in aqueous                             
              solutions and preliminary determination of the                                 
              effectiveness of the sufactants for removal of the organic                     
              contaminants from simulated aquifers.                                          
                                                                                             
              The proposal leading to this review was submitted in                           
              response to NSF 90-121, Research Planning Grants and                           
              Career Advancement Awards for Women Scientists and                             
              Engineers.  It addresses the conduct of a research                             
              planning grant in response to the effort NSF is making to                      
              assist in increasing the number of new women investigators                     
              participating in NSF's supported research programs and to                      
              facilitate conduct of preliminary studies and other                            
              activities that are likely to result in the development of                     
              competitive research projects by women who have not                            
              previously had independent Federal research funding.
