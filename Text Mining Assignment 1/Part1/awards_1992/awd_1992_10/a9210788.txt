Abstract    :
              There are two primary goals of the research proposed in this                   
              planning grant:  1) to investigate the reliability of the sister               
              group relationship between the bumble bees and stingless bees (two             
              tribes of the family Apidae) inferred from a recent parsimony                  
              analysis of mitochondrial rRNA sequences; and 2) to provide the                
              phylogenetic foundation for developing a long term research program            
              focusing on the evolution of social traits within the primitively              
              eusocial apid tribe Bombini (bumble bees) by constructing a                    
              phylogeny of the species within the behaviorally diverse bumble bee            
              subgenus Fervidobombus. The results of this nested phylogenetic                
              investigation will provide knowledge of the appropriate outgroup to            
              the bumble bees, a necessity for understanding relationships within            
              the bumble bees.  Resolution of the relationships within                       
              Fervidobombus will provide the foundation for understanding many of            
              the behavioral transitions from relatively simple to more complex              
              social behavior that have occurred within the subgenus. Ultimately,            
              this interdisciplinary approach, which integrates systematics and              
              animal behavior by using phylogenies to test hypotheses of                     
              behavioral transformation, will increase understanding and                     
              collaboration between these two important disciplines of                       
              evolutionary biology.  The study will also increase understanding              
              of the biology of an important group of insect pollinators of wild             
              and crop plants. //
