Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                  Rama is an obsolescent Chibchan language of Nicaragua.  The               
              goal of this project is to produce a reference dictionary by                   
              consolidating, correcting, updating and adding to data already                 
              available such as Lehmann (1914), Diccionario Elemental Rama                   
              (Craig, 1987) and the data produced for a grammar of Rama (Craig,              
              1988).  The dictionary will include a grammatical sketch, entries              
              with illustrative sentence examples as well as grammatical,                    
              semantic and cultural information.  It is intended as a reference              
              work for general linguists, as a tool for Chibchan comparative                 
              studies, and as a model for using a Macintiosh personal computer               
              to compile a dictionary from a textual database.  This dictionary              
              is part of a comprehensive documentation project of the Rama                   
              language initiated in 1985 at the request of the Rama community.               
              It is a principal tool for the community-based language                        
              revitalization project developed as one of the implementations of              
              the language policies of the Autonomy Laws of the Atlantic Coast               
              of Nicaragua established by the Sandinista government in 1987.                 
              It is designed to be a model for future dictionaries of the other              
              indigenous languages of Nicaragua.
