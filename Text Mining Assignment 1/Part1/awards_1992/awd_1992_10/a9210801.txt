Abstract    :
              The purpose of this research is to assess the evolution and the                
              performance of the labor market in the U.S. and abroad.  The                   
              research will consist of four separate, but related projects.                  
              The first will analyze the determinants of regional fluctuations               
              in wages, earnings, and employment.  This project is built around              
              an empirical model of labor demand that can isolate the effects                
              of product demand shifts and technical change on labor market                  
              outcomes.  This is of interest for its application to local labor              
              markets, and for its implications for changes in aggregate wages               
              and employment.  Second, a set of international comparisons will               
              be developed regarding the evolution of labor markets, focusing                
              on countries that provide important contrasts to the U.S.                      
              experience.  A key goal is to compare the evolution of labor                   
              markets in Korea and Taiwan where productivity and wages tripled               
              in less than 15 years to the more developed countries of the U.S.              
              and Sweden that experienced sluggish growth in productivity and                
              wages.  Third, the relationships between changes in wages, labor               
              supply, and unemployment will be determined and analyzed.                      
              Finally, work will be initiated on a modern, quantitative history              
              of labor markets in the U.S.  Among other topics this project                  
              will include work on changes in the structure of wages, the                    
              evolution of unemployment and labor force participation, changes               
              in labor markets, and effects of immigration.
