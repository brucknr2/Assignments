Abstract    :
              Recent research in active vision has show that creating a visual               
              system for a robot interacting with an unstructured, dynamic                   
              world differs vastly from interpreting a static image.  On one                 
              hand, the constraints of real-time performance force                           
              optimizations such as a focus of attention and spatially variant               
              sensing.  On the other hand, the availability of a large number                
              of views, whose acquisition is controlled by the robot, has                    
              proven to simplify problems enormously.  In addition, the                      
              processing necessary to permit intelligent behavior has been                   
              found to be easier to achieve than the difficult goal of                       
              reconstruction and full interpretation of a science form a single              
              image.  This research explores two open problems suggested by                  
              ongoing research in active vision.  One problem is the study the               
              control of a spatially variant (foveal) sensor using the low-                  
              resolution formation available in the periphery.  In particular,               
              this research will examine the use of color information, which                 
              has been shown to be well preserved under low resolution.  The                 
              other problem is the integration of set of visual modules, each                
              capable of sustaining a particular task, with a suitable robot                 
              architecture sos that the resulting system is capable of timely,               
              flexible interaction with a dynamic world. //
