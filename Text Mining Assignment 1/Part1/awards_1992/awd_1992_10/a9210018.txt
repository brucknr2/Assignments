Abstract    :
                   As the product life cycles become shorter, and the product                
              variety increases, it has become crucial to minimize the lag period            
              between the start of a product's design and the time it is                     
              manufactured.  It is also crucial to be able to produce products               
              in small to medium quantities in a cost effective manner with high             
              quality.  The objectives of this project are to develop a                      
              qualitative model of geometry and structure, a new case-based                  
              method for construction of manufacturing process plans for three               
              dimensional objects, and new representation and reasoning methods              
              for recognition of features and modeling of features defined by the            
              users.                                                                         
                   Investigation will be performed and a computer based                      
              environment for integrated issues will be developed.  The computer             
              based system will be tested on different sets of components, and               
              will be used to assess the capabilities and limitations of the                 
              underlying models.
