Abstract    :
              The proposed research focuses on                                               
              using genetically-engineered                                                   
              microorganisms to efficiently                                                  
              decontaminate hazardous waste                                                  
              sites. The natural ability of                                                  
              bacterial cells to degrade organic                                             
              compounds will be enhanced using                                               
              the techniques of genetic                                                      
              engineering.  The goal will be to                                              
              alter the genetic information of                                               
              the cell such that the genes that                                              
              code for the enzymes responsible                                               
              for the degradation of                                                         
              3-chlorocatechol will be uncoupled                                             
              from their wild-type regulator                                                 
              machinery.  By replacing the                                                   
              wild-type promoter with one that                                               
              can be controlled externally, the                                              
              bacteria can be engineered to                                                  
              degrade the recalcitrant compound                                              
              at faster rates.  In addition,                                                 
              modifying the enzymatic pathway                                                
              will enable the bacteria to reduce                                             
              the final residual concentration of                                            
              toxic wastes in the soil below the                                             
              level that is currently achievable.
