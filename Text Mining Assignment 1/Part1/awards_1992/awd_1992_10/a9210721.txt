Abstract    :
              the research will be concerned with the development of a new and               
              efficient approach to the simulation of construction processes,                
              based on the use of artificial neural networks.  The primary                   
              objective is to capitalize on the automatic modeling capabilities              
              and inherent speed of neural networks, so as to make simulation a              
              more accessible and productive tool for planners.                              
                                                                                             
              Alternative schemes for implementing construction simulation in                
              neural network environment will be evaluated to determine that with            
              the greatest efficacy.  This will be measured in terms of the speed            
              of execution of a simulation, the ease with which valid models can             
              be built, the accuracy of simulation results.  The comparison will             
              be made over a comprehensive range of modeling situations.                     
              consideration will be given to all principal types of neural                   
              architecture and training procedure that have potential application            
              to the problem.                                                                
                                                                                             
              The solution is expected to increase simulation speed by several               
              orders of magnitude relative to conventional simulation methods,               
              make processing speed independent of the complexity of a model, and            
              facilitate the task of building valid models.  Many of the concepts            
              and ideas developed in the research could be extended to simulation            
              applications outside the field of construction.
