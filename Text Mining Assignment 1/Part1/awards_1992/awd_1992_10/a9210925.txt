Abstract    :
              An adaptive approach to qualitative modeling of physical devices               
              will be investigated.  The behaviors of a physical device, in this             
              approach, are acquired by modifying and combining structure                    
              behavior models of known devices and behavioral models of generic              
              domain mechanisms.  The structure-behavior model of a specific                 
              device explicitly specifies its structure, its functions, and the              
              internal causal behaviors that show how its structure achieves its             
              functions.  The behavioral model of a generic domain mechanism                 
              specifies its function and model of a known device is revised by               
              model-revision plans, where each plan accommodates a specific type             
              of structural or functional difference between the new and the                 
              known devices.  The process of model revision is focused by                    
              knowledge of the internal causal behaviors of the known device.                
              The research will evaluate the adaptive approach to qualitative                
              modeling for solving the task of design verification.  The design-             
              verification task is to predict whether a proposed design will                 
              deliver the functions desired of it.  This research will contribute            
              to qualitative modeling by providing a unified view of qualitative             
              modeling, model memory, and model learning.
