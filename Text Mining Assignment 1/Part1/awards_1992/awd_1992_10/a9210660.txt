Abstract    :
                   This award supports research on the representation theory of              
              Lie algebras.  The principal investigator will continue work on                
              the Lie cohomology of some vector fields algebras.  He will also               
              consider the modular representations of Kac-Moody algebras at the              
              critical level.                                                                
                   This research is concerned with a mathematical object called              
              a Lie algebra.  Lie algebras arise from another object called a                
              Lie group.  An example of a Lie group is the rotations of a                    
              sphere where one rotation is followed by another.  Lie groups and              
              Lie algebras are important in areas involving analysis of                      
              spherical motion.
