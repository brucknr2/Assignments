Abstract    :
              This research is directed at the investigation of formal mechanisms            
              to focus the reasoning and handle contradictions in formal common              
              sense reasoning framework.  An important contribution of the                   
              research is the framework it will provide for truly real time                  
              common sense reasoning.  The proposed research is the directed at              
              enhancing the step logic formalism to provide a formal model to                
              real time common sense reasoning.  Step logic is a formalism                   
              designed to model the ongoing process of deduction.  What makes the            
              step logic formalism so unique is that the logic explicitly allows             
              unsound inferences (i.e. contradictions can arise).  This is done              
              in the interest of efficiency (that is, to avoid the consistency               
              check problem).  The objectives of the research are to investigate             
              ways of focusing one's reasoning, to develop a means of focusing               
              the reasoning of the step logic formalism, to investigate methods              
              of handling contradictions efficiently, and to develop a more                  
              general method of handling contradictions within the steplogic                 
              formalism.  The attainment of these objectives will result in a                
              non monotonic reasoning formalism that is not only tractable, but              
              real time.  The research issues will be addressed both in terms of             
              theory as well as implementation.
