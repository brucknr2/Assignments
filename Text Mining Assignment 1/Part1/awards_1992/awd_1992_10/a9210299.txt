Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of this project is to develop, in the P.I.'s laboratory,              
              techniques for whole cell patch clamp recording from neurons in the            
              inferior colliculus (IC) of awake echolocating bats.  Pilot data               
              show that such studies are feasible, and suggest that the use of               
              patch clamp recording to measure sound-evoked EPSCs and IPSCs in               
              vivo will yield a wealth of new information on signal processing               
              mechanisms in the auditory midbrain.  Initially this technique will            
              be used to investigate the hypothesis that IC cells have long                  
              periods of subthreshold facilitation or inhibition following sound-            
              evoked discharge.                                                              
                                                                                             
              Patch clamp recording is the best method available for studying                
              subthreshold synaptic processes.  Neurons remain healthy longer and            
              the signal-to-noise ration is better than when they are impaled                
              with intracellular microelectrodes.  These factors are important               
              when recording from small neurons such as those in the IC, and when            
              measuring stimulus-evoked responses where lengthy testing of                   
              different variables is necessary.                                              
                                                                                             
              The in vivo patch clamp technique is an essential addition to the              
              anatomical, electrophysiological and neuropharmacological methods              
              currently employed by the P.I. because it will, for the first time,            
              make natural subthreshold synaptic events amenable to                          
              investigation.
