Abstract    :
              This project will determine if                                                 
              bonding characteristics between                                                
              bone minerals and organic phases                                               
              play a role in the mechanical                                                  
              properties of aged or osteoporotic                                             
              bones, in addition to changes in                                               
              bone mass.  The bonding between the                                            
              bone mineral and the organic                                                   
              constituents will be altered by                                                
              treating the bone tissue with                                                  
              special buffer solutions which                                                 
              contain potential determining and

              including the elastic moduli, yield

              This project is important since it                                             
              is thought that osteoporosis not

              but also changes in bone quality.

              bonding characteristics that these                                             
              investigators will study.
