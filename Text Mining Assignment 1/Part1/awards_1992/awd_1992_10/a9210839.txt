Abstract    :
                   Computer simulation of the kinematic and dynamic behavior of              
              mechanical assemblies has become a very important tool in design               
              and manufacturing.  The designer can foresee how a product is going            
              to perform before the product is actually fabricated.  The most                
              current simulation modules are based on analysis from other                    
              kinematic or dynamic modules by specifying conditions between                  
              components and then displaying the motions on a screen.  This                  
              computer simulation actually performs similarly to a movie and can             
              only provide visual checking.  The drawback of this simulation                 
              approach is that designers are forced to use the available joint               
              models and may lose their creativity.  In this project, a prototype            
              feature-based modeling system will be developed with which a                   
              designer can interactively create an assembly of mechanical                    
              components ready for dynamic analysis.  Contact points between                 
              parts will be modeled as temporary joints in which reaction forces             
              will be used to determine the status of the contact points.                    
              Experimental analysis will also be conducted to enhance and verify             
              the analytical result.                                                         
                   This project can provide a state-of-the-art technology for                
              real simulation of general mechanical systems and act as a                     
              cost-effective test bed for concepts, final design and control                 
              algorithms.
