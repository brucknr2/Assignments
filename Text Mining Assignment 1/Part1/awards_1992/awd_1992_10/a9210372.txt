Abstract    :
              The extensive study of scheduling problems since the early                     
              fifties is motivated by questions arising in production                        
              planning, computer system controlling, or even everyday                        
              activities such as scheduling an efficient working day in a                    
              company or planning an examination period in a university.                     
              Scheduling is about all situations in which scarce                             
              resources have to be allocated to tasks over time.  This                       
              project will investigate Liu's conjecture, a simply-defined                    
              theoretical scheduling problem about worst-case performance                    
              ratio,  as an approach to scheduling and sequencing problems.
