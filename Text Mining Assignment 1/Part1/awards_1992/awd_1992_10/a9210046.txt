Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The optics of the eye focus an image of the world onto the retina              
              which contains four types of photoreceptors: blue, green and red               
              cones and a single type of rod.  Experiments are being conducted to            
              learn how the signals from the three cone photoreceptor types of the           
              retina are organized and how the information about color is                    
              organized and processed by the early stages of the visual system.              
                                                                                             
              Conventional wisdom holds that information from photoreceptors is              
              transmitted by two main visual pathways in the brain:  one is                  
              sluggish and transmits information about color; the other is rapid             
              and transmits information about intensity.  The specific studies               
              being conducted in this research project use flickering light of               
              different colors and flicker interactions to address specific                  
              questions about the nature of these two visual pathways, as well as            
              how their signals change when the visual system adapts to                      
              increasingly intense lights.  This research is providing clear                 
              evidence that the early stages of the visual system are more complex           
              than the prevailing psychophysical models suggest.
