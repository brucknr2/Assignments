Abstract    :
              Series-parallel graphs are a subclass of graphs that can be defined            
              recursively.  The proposed research will find fast algorithms for              
              finding the edge-connectivity of a series-parallel graph and for               
              maintaining this connectivity information dynamically.  The long-term          
              goal is to modify the techniques used for solving problems in series-          
              parallel graphs so that they can be used to solve the same problems in         
              wider classes of graphs.  This may yield algorithms that are faster or         
              simpler as well as ideas that can be applied to a variety of problems.
