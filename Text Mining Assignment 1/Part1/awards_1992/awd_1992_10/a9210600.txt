Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Award is to support                     
              research whose objective is to understand how individuals                      
              formulate and make decisions about insurance as a form of                      
              financial protection against low probability but high consequence              
              events.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              Adults will be interviewed regarding three different insurance                 
              decisions.  The study is designed as a conceptual replication of               
              the well-known Kunreuther (1978) study of how people make hazard               
              (flood and earthquake) insurance decisions.  This involves                     
              testing models based upon Subjective Expected Utility (SEU) and                
              information diffusion theories, that latter of which has been                  
              hypothesized to be descriptively more accurate.  The research                  
              objectives are to (1) test whether the information diffusion                   
              theory generalizes to other types of insurance, (2) determine                  
              whether SEU predicts better when improved response elicitation                 
              methods are used, and (3) determine whether people use consistent              
              strategies when considering different kinds of insurance.  In                  
              addition, the project will examine whether consumers' intuitive                
              definitions of insurance (and its purposes), beliefs about the                 
              insurance system, and budget constraints predict consumers'                    
              decisions.
