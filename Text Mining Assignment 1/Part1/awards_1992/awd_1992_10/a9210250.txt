Abstract    :
              The research to be performed on this RIA award will investigate,               
              theoretically, the influence of reinforcement cracking and                     
              interfacial debonding on composite flow strength, creep                        
              resistance and fracture toughness.  Rigorous finite element                    
              analyses will be carried out to determine how the overall limit                
              flow stress of a damaged composite depends on the volume fraction              
              and shape of the reinforcing particles, the percentage of these                
              particles which are damaged, and the characteristics of the                    
              matrix material.
