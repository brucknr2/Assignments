Abstract    :
              The research to be performed on this RIA award will evaluate the               
              effect on the matrix constraint - and thus on creep resistance -               
              of diffusional relaxation and interface slip along the matrix-                 
              reinforcement interface of intermetallic matrix composites.  Unit              
              cell models will be used and solved by the finite element method.              
              AS coupled analysis of slip and diffusion, along with fiber                    
              cracking, will also be performed to investigate the net effect of              
              the reinforcement size.//
