Abstract    :
                 This is the first year funding of a three continuing award                  
              IRI-9210423.  This project seeks to contribute to automatic                    
              systems capable of reasoning about a robotic environment based on              
              imperfect sensory data and recovering errors of robot motions                  
              caused by intrinsic and inevitable system uncertainties.                       
              Specifically, the project studies how to acquire sufficiently                  
              accurate information about the spatial state of an object in the               
              presence of sensing and modeling uncertainties and develops                    
              practical strategies for automatic assembly motions based on the               
              spatial states of the parts involved.  The project particularly                
              focuses on, in the presence of uncertainties, the automatic                    
              recognition of unintended collision/contacts between a held part               
              (by a manipulator) and the environment by combining                            
              position/orientation sensing, vision sensing, and force/moment                 
              sensing, and the automatic generation of motion plans based on                 
              the obtained contact information, as remedy plans, to lead the                 
              part to its intended goal from the unintended collision/contact.               
              The project expects to result in the implementation of a                       
              prototype system capable of such automatic recognition of                      
              contacts and generation of contact-based plans, as well as proper              
              execution of the plans, all in the presence of uncertainties. //
