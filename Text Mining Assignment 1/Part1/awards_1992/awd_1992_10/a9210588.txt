Abstract    :
              Multidatabase systems respond to the need of organizations to                  
              support applications that require information maintained by several            
              autonomous and possibly heterogeneous database systems.  A                     
              fundamental requirement underlying Multidatabase systems is the                
              preservation of the autonomy of the individual database systems.               
              However, autonomy requirements cause problems in maintaining                   
              traditional database consistency in these systems, the reason being            
              that autonomy and consistency are conflicting requirements.                    
              Attempts to strike a balance between these two requirements have               
              focused on new correctness criteria.  However, very little analysis            
              has been done with respect to (a) the semantics of autonomy                    
              requirements and (b) their implications for both consistency                   
              requirements and implementation considerations. The goal of this               
              research is to systematically analyze autonomy and consistency by              
              applying a uniform specification technique to express autonomy                 
              requirements and correctness criteria, thereby explicitly showing              
              their relationships and identifying the tradeoffs between them.  By            
              understanding these tradeoffs and their effects on different parts             
              of a database system, this work will help in the development of                
              Multidatabase systems and will have an impact on the integration of            
              other systems in which autonomy and consistency are requirements.
