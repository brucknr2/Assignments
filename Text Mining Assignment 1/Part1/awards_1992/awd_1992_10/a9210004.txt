Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project should make important contributions to theoretical                
              econometrics and to applied economics.  This project addresses                 
              problems in two major subfields of econometric theory: latent                  
              variables and quantile regressions.  The theoretical research is               
              accompanied by significant empirical applications.  The results                
              of this project should provide applied economists with more                    
              general and more powerful statistical tools for studying the                   
              behavior of financial markets and the characteristics of labor                 
              markets.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              More specifically, this project develops new methods for using                 
              longitudinal data to allow for latent variables in nonlinear                   
              models.  The latent variables are individual effects that vary                 
              across individuals but are constant over time.  The project will               
              focus on relaxing strict exogeneity assumptions, so that                       
              covariate values may be partly determined by previous values of                
              the response variable.  Empirical applications of the techniques               
              will be developed.  The project will also examine inference                    
              procedures in cross-section studies using quantile regression.                 
              Extensions of quantile regression for use with longitudinal data               
              will be explores.
