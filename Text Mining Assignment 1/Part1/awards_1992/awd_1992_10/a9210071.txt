Abstract    :
              While traditional video-rate applications have required no more                
              than 10-bit resolution, new applications such as wide-dynamic-                 
              range imaging systems require at least 12-bit resolution.  The                 
              requirements for such applications exceed the capabilities of                  
              present, state-of-the-art analog-to-digital converters using CMOS              
              technologies.  Progress in this area could dramatically reduce the             
              cost of signal processing for these applications by allowing the               
              use of digital signal processing techniques.  The objectives of                
              this project are:                                                              
                                                                                             
              1.  to create techniques that can overcome the practical linearity             
              limitations of analog-to-digital conversion interfaces without an              
              associated loss in conversion rate and without the use of trimming             
              or calibration, and,                                                           
                                                                                             
              2.  to demonstrate these techniques by fabricating prototypes.                 
                                                                                             
              The focus of 1. will be on pipelined, analog-to-digital conversion             
              interfaces in CMOS technologies for high-resolution, video-rate                
              applications.  Circuit techniques that can overcome the practical              
              linearity limitations will be studied.  Since these techniques may             
              reduce the maximum conversion rate, combinations of parallelism and            
              digital-signal-processing techniques that have the potential to                
              overcome such a reduction will be explored.
