Abstract    :
              This RIA award will investigate, both experimentally and                       
              analytically, the anisotropy, and anisotropic yielding.  That                  
              occurs in amorphous polymers due to molecular alignment (or                    
              orientation, or texture) that is produced during deformation.                  
              Based on that study, an accurate constitutive relation will be                 
              developed that closely describes the experimentally observed                   
              anisotropic yielding.  Such a relationship will be useful in                   
              subsequent studies of manufacturing processes in which such                    
              materials undergo large inelastic deformations.
