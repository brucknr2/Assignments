Abstract    :
              The proposed projects has two major objectives:  1)                            
              development of a new optical diagnostic capable of making                      
              simultaneous, full-field measurements of all three velocity                    
              components and particle size and number density distributions                  
              in two-phase flows, and 2) characterization of particle                        
              trajectories and size distributions in an arc spray coating                    
              system and their relation to coating porosity and grain                        
              structure.  The accuracy and  dynamic range limitations of the                 
                                                                                             
              new technique will first be characterize in a small wind                       
              tunnel seeded with known size particles.  Both free stream and                 
                                                                                             
              stagnation flow measurements will be made and compared to                      
              independently measured velocity profiles.  A single solid-                     
              state camera would acquire images of particle velocities (all                  
              three components), sizes, and number densities.                                
                                                                                             
              The technique will be used to characterize the relationship                    
              between particle velocities, size, and temperature to coating                  
              quality in an arc spray system.  Similar conditions exists in                  
              paint sprays and fuel sprays.
