Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              An important function of estradiol (E2) is to stimulate                        
              cell proliferation and to induce synthesis of specific proteins                
              in target cells.  Both of these effects are believed to involve                
              changes in the RNA transcriptional program of target cells.                    
              Experiments are designed to detect transcriptional changes in                  
              cultured human endometrial cells (Ishikawa cell line) in response              
              to physiological concentrations of E2.  There are a number of                  
              human endometrial cell lines around but few of them actually                   
              retain E2 responsiveness.  The Ishikawa cell line has been shown               
              to retain its ability to respond: proliferation can be                         
              stimulated and specific proteins can be induced.  Changes in                   
              specific mRNA are essential to these effects.  These changes will              
              be studied in a systematic way during the first 24 hours                       
              following the addition of E2.  If E2 effects on these cells are                
              comparable to those occurring in vivo it might be expected that                
              some genes will be induced soon after exposure, as a direct                    
              result of E2 receptor interaction with DNA (primary response).                 
              Other gene inductions may not be detected until many hours after               
              E2, their induction requiring a protein induced as part of the                 
              primary response.  Such responses are sometimes characterized as               
              secondary responses.  Experiments are suggested that may lead to               
              detecting whether both kinds of mRNA's are increased in response               
              to E2 in human endometrial cells and begin to study and compare                
              the characteristics of these responses.
