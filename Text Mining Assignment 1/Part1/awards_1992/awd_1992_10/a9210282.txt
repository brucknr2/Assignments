Abstract    :
              This study will use a                                                          
              porohyperelastic model to study                                                
              fluid transport, and in particular                                             
              lipid transport, within the                                                    
              arterial wall.  This model will                                                
              include history-dependent finite                                               
              deformation, stress, and transmural                                            
              tissue fluid flow.  Experimental                                               
              studies will be used to verify                                                 
              and/or modify the model.                                                       
                                                                                             
              The model that will be developed in                                            
              this study is a step towards                                                   
              achieving a comprehensive arterial                                             
              wall model that would help explain                                             
              the etiology of atherosclerosis.                                               
              The results could have an impact on                                            
              the design of arterial vascular

              study of other tissues including                                               
              cartilage and skin.
