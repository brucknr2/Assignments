Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                            
              This research adapt and develop measures and to construct a                    
              research paradigm that will allow researchers to investigate how               
              children perceive marital conflict between their parents.  The                 
              long-term goal is to determine how children learn to balance                   
              their own goals with those of others by observing and                          
              participating in conflicts that occur in the course of enduring                
              relationships.  Specifically, the researcher will extend her own               
              methodological expertise to expand inquiry in the area of social               
              conflict and child development.  The PI will learn an established              
              methodology for observing, coding, and analyzing marital conflict              
              working with Dr. John Gottman at the University of Washington,                 
              and adapt it, as necessary, to operationalize the construct of                 
              "balancing own and others' goals".  She will pilot an interview                
              protocol for obtaining young children's perceptions of marital                 
              conflict and develop criteria for coding those perceptions.  When              
              the piloting process for the child perception measure is                       
              complete, the PI will collect and compare child perceptions with               
              the same events as recorded by a trained observer, as well as                  
              with coding affect and behavior observed when children viewed the              
              marital conflict.
