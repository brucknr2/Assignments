Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to investigate the development                
              of the inversion routine for the Spectral-Analysis-of-Surface-                 
              Waves (SASW) method. Three approaches are going to be                          
              investigated. The first approach is based on the comparison of                 
              the experimental dispersion curve and the curve from the                       
              numerical simulation of the SASW test for an assumed profile. The              
              other two approaches represent simplifications of the first one,               
              that might significantly reduce computational effort and at the                
              same time preserve the desired level of accuracy. ***//
