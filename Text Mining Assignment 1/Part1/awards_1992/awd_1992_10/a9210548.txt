Abstract    :
                   This project will develop and analyze algorithms for                      
              multipoint routing in communication networks. A multipoint                     
              connection, instead of joining just two hosts by a path, joins a               
              set of two or more hosts; and instead of a single path, a                      
              multipoint connection consists of a  set of links and switches                 
              creating multiple paths, usually in the form of a tree.  The                   
              underlying model used here is a connection oriented communication              
              network represented by an undirected graph with edge costs. In                 
              addition, bandwidth is reserved for each  connection, so that                  
              communication delay is not the main consideration, but, instead,               
              the  main criteria for route selection is the minimal usage of                 
              network resources. Finally, since a practical multipoint routing               
              algorithm must be able to deal with a set of hosts that changes                
              over time, the dynamic Steiner tree problem is the appropriate                 
              graph theoretic model for this problem.  This investigation                    
              will include empirical studies of routing algorithms through the               
              use  of a routing simulator along with the more theoretical                    
              analysis. The primary objective is to develop more efficient                   
              multipoint routing algorithms that will allow future networks to               
              effectively support a wide range of applications such as                       
              conference calls and video broadcasts.
