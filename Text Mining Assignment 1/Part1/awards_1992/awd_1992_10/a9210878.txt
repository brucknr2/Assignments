Abstract    :
              The objectives of the proposed research are: 1)                                
              develop a neural net-based real-time load model for                            
              both dynamic and distribution system analyses; and                             
              2) design a "smart" monitor for controlling                                    
              distribution system capacitors, voltage regulators,                            
              and load tap changing transformers.  The research                              
              will determine dynamic and distribution system                                 
              models that represent load as a function  of voltage                           
              and frequency.  Tests will be made on Central                                  
              Maine Power Company feeders to obtain data with                                
              which to train a probabilistic neural network.  The                            
              neural network learning algorithm will be                                      
              implemented with a digital signal processor in a                               
              "smart" monitor that will be able to map a vector of                           
              measured and other relevant variables to load                                  
              parameters will be used for dynamic system studies                             
              and will allow real-time volt-var control on a                                 
              distribution feeder.  An important goal of the                                 
              proposed research is to produce load models or                                 
              modeling techniques that can be used in standard                               
              ways by other researchers applying well-known                                  
              analysis methods.
