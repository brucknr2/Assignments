Abstract    :
              Streptomyces is a genus of soil bacteria that undergoes                        
              differentiation in response to nutrient limitation.  Among the                 
              bacterial genera known to differentiate, Streptomyces stands out               
              because differentiation of this genus is a reproductive                        
              developmental process: one filamentous mycelial community divides              
              into thousands of autonomous, uninucleate spores.  To understand               
              the molecular basis of cellular division and differentiation in a              
              relatively simple organism, we have isolated and characterized                 
              nonsporulation mutants of Streptomyces griseus and have identified             
              a gene (orf1590) involved in streptomycete sporulation.  A defect              
              in orf5190 may result in the premature and irregular formation of              
              sporulation septa, pointing to spore wall biosynthesis as the                  
              aberrant process in orf1590 mutants.  Previous studies implicate               
              transcriptional and translational mechanisms in the regulated                  
              expression of orf1590 and the activity of its gene product.  Our               
              overall objective is to define the function of orf1590 in                      
              streptomycete sporulation by characterizing the product of orf1590.            
              We will use molecular techniques to determine the number of                    
              polypeptides encoded by orf1590, identify proteins that accumulate             
              subsequent to expression of orf1590, and clone the genes encoding              
              these sporulation-specific proteins as well as proteins that are               
              likely to play a major role in the formation of sporulation septa.             
              These experiments have also been designed to extend our dissection             
              of the developmental defect in nonsporulating mutants.                         
              %%%                                                                            
              Continued analysis of orf1590 and other Streptomyces developmental             
              genes can be expected to reveal a variety of intricate and novel               
              regulatory cascades central to cellular division and development.
