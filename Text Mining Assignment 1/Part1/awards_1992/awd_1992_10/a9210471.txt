Abstract    :
              The U.S. Interagency Arctic Buoy Program (USIABP) will provide                 
              the Management structure and coordination necessary to establish               
              and maintain a baseline network of drifting buoys of sufficient                
              spatial resolution and longevity to define surface synoptic scale              
              atmospheric pressure, air temperature and sea ice drift fields in              
              the Arctic.  This data can separated into two separate                         
              categories:                                                                    
                                                                                             
               A)   Near real-time data for operational use in weather and sea               
              ice forecasting.  These data are processed by System Argos and                 
              distributed via the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Global             
              Telecommunication System (GTS).                                                
                                                                                             
               B)  "Historical" data that are processed, quality controlled and              
              archived to meet the established needs of the scientific research              
              community. //
