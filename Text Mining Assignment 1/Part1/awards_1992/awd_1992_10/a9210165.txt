Abstract    :
              The proposed research will investigate the mechanism of isotopic               
              and chemical interaction between metasomatic fluid and upper mantle            
              assemblages.  Xenolith samples from South African kimberlites and              
              alkali basalts for the southwestern United States have been chosen             
              for study.  Neoblasts, porphyroclasts, and non-recrystallized                  
              phases will be analyzed for REE, LILE (Ba, Sr, Rb, Na, K) and HFSE             
              (Ti, Nb, Zr, Hf, Ta) by a combination of electron microprobe and               
              SIMS to discern the relationship of incompatible trace element                 
              geochemistry to recrystallization.  Possible variations in                     
              oxidation state associated with textural variations will also be               
              investigated.  Isotopic measurements (87Sr/86Sr, and 143Nd/144ND)              
              will be made on separates of porphyrocalsts and neoblasts of                   
              olivine and orthopyroxene to determine whether isotopic                        
              compositions vary systematically with grain size.  In addition,                
              isotopic measurements for garnet, clinopyroxene, and when possible             
              minor phases (i.e. oxides or mica) will be determined so that the              
              total data set can be combined with data for garnet and spinel                 
              lherzolites from basalts.  This investigation will add to the                  
              understanding of the upper mantle processes which result in                    
              metasomatism.
