Abstract    :
              This proposal addresses an important problem in                                
              system and control area: the analysis and design of                            
              control systems in the face of uncertainty.  The                               
              problem of designing a control system against                                  
              uncertainties is of fundamental practical interest                             
              and has been the main thrust for development of                                
              control theory and technology.  The proposed                                   
              research on this subject includes stability analysis,                          
              stabilization, and disturbance rejection in the                                
              presence of real, possible nonlinear/time varying,                             
              uncertainties.  Each of these problems is of                                   
              independent interest and they together follow a                                
              natural progression toward the development of a                                
              general methodology for analysis and design of                                 
              uncertain systems.  The main object under here will                            
              be an uncertain dynamical system described by a                                
              linear fractional transformation, and the necessary                            
              tools required for this research include advanced                              
              matrix theory, convex optimization techniques, and                             
              modern robust control theory.  The approaches and                              
              idea proposed here are believed to be unique and                               
              original.  In particular, the proposed approaches for                          
              the stabilization of systems with structured                                   
              nonlinear/time varying uncertainty using the                                   
              combination of convex optimization and advanced                                
              separation principle, and using the parameter                                  
              dependent gain scheduled controller, appear very                               
              promising, and are expected to lead to valuable                                
              applications in practical design of highly complex                             
              uncertain systems.
