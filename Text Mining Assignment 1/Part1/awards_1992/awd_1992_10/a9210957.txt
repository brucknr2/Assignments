Abstract    :
              The learnability of classes of functions in various formal                     
              learning models will be studied.  There have been many                         
              negative results on learning even simple classes of functions                  
              in the Valiant PAC model.  One goal of this research is to                     
              develop algorithms for learning relatively complex classes of                  
              functions in other learning models.  A related goal is to                      
              determine the relative power of some of these learning models.                 
              Also proposed is the study of the relation between                             
              learnability of a class of functions, structural properties of                 
              the class, and the complexity of decision problems involving                   
              the class, in order to discover which classes of functions are                 
              learnable, by what means they are learnable, and what inherent                 
              qualities make them learnable.
