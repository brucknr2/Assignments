Abstract    :
                   This grant supports a search for 0  decay using large                  
              volume semiconductor detectors fabricated from Ge which has                    
              been isotopically enriched to 86% in 76Ge.  The detectors are                  
              designed to have ultra-low backgrounds from their constituents                 
              and are to be operated in low backgorund underground                           
              laboratories.  The effort supported by this grant is that of a                 
              University of South Carolina professor and his graduate                        
              students, working in collaboration (IGEX) with scientists from                 
              the University of Minnesota, University of Zaragoza (Spain),                   
              The Moscow Institute for Theoretical and Experimental Physics                  
              (ITEP), and The Baksan Neutrino Observatory (Armenia), and the                 
              Pacific Northwest Laboratory.
