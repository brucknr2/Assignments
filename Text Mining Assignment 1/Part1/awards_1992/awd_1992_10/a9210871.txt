Abstract    :
              This research is on developing efficient Built-In-Self-Test (BIST)             
              schemes which detect delay as well as stuck at faults.  Goals are              
              reasonable testing time and minimal BIST hardware.  The research               
              has two thrusts.  First is exploration of two weighted test pattern            
              generator designs.  Quaternary weighted test pattern generators,               
              are being designed to be a good source of pseudo-random tests.                 
              Another is an algorithm to generate temporally correlated test                 
              patterns in such a way that the two vectors required to detect                 
              delay faults are best.  The key idea is that the weights are used              
              to generate correlations between consecutive vectors.  Second,                 
              extensive fault simulations are being performed to develop an error            
              model for the test pattern generators, as well as a composite fault            
              model.  Analysis is being made to determine temporal correlation               
              between errors due to consecutive vectors, and distribution of                 
              errors in space.  Compression schemes based on this data are                   
              planned.
