Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Mixing experiments at short vertical scales will be done in the                
              Eastern North Atlantic using both the High Resolution Profiler                 
              (HRP) and Shadowgraph Television (STV).  This cruise will be                   
              closely related to and coordinated with the North Atlantic Tracer              
              Release Experiment (NATRE), a WOCE Core Three contribution.
