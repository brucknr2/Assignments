Abstract    :
                   This award supports the development of a computer software                
              system enabling large scale research computing projects dealing                
              with systems of polynomial equations in many variables.  The                   
              result of the project will be a usable and efficient computer                  
              program, which executes the Groebner basis algorithm for                       
              computing standard bases and syzygies of ideals and modules over               
              polynomial rings.  Improvements over the existing program,                     
              Macaulay, will include the addition of a good programming                      
              language for the user, the ability to work over more general                   
              coefficient rings, and increased speed of execution.  This                     
              project is in the general area of commutative algebra and the                  
              computer-aided computational aspects of this field.  There is a                
              growing interest in using computers to answer theoretical                      
              questions in algebra and conversely, algebra is quite useful for               
              the development of algorithms.  This project makes serious use of              
              both the theory and practice of symbolic calculations to solve                 
              real problems in commutative algebra.
