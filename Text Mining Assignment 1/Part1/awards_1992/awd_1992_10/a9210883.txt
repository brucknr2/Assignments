Abstract    :
                   The objective of this project is to develop a technique for               
              the geometric design of a spatial mechanism to guarantee                       
              interference free motion for its links.  The technique employs the             
              top down design method rather than conventional trial and error.               
              To design the geometry of a link in a spatial mechanism, the space             
              domain, called a swept solid, which identifies the potential region            
              of conflict between the link and other members of the mechanism,               
              is generated.  Placing the link geometry outside of this domain                
              guarantees that it will be free of interference.                               
                   Although this study focuses on spatial linkages,                          
              implementation of the technique should yield valuable insights for             
              the geometric design of other mechanical systems.  Results can also            
              be used to study spatial motion between any two objects which may              
              result in conflict.
