Abstract    :
                   An important problem with the hot isostatic pressing (HIP)                
              process is the occurrence of shape distortion, which greatly limits            
              the potential of HIP as a net or near net shape processing                     
              technology.  The basic objective of the research is to explore the             
              use of feedback control principles for reducing the unpredictable              
              shape distortion due to model inaccuracy and process disturbance.              
              The feedback compensation is achieved by adjusting the HIP                     
              temperature and pressure in real time based on the densification               
              information provided by the in-situ eddy current sensors.  Due to              
              the multi-input multi-output, nonlinear and uncertain nature of the            
              HIP process dynamics, a modified version of the model predictive               
              control method will be used to design the computer control system.             
              A state estimator will be constructed to estimate the densification            
              status from the impedance values provided by the eddy current                  
              sensors.                                                                       
                   The research results from this project will not only lead to              
              closed-loop computer control systems for improving HIP quality and             
              productivity, but may also be useful for the development of                    
              real-time feedback control systems for other material processing               
              systems.  If successful, the research will allow the production of             
              part from powdered metal with a high degree of consistency and                 
              shape accuracy, reducing scrap.
