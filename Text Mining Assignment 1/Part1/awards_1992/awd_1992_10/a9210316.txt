Abstract    :
              A Research Initiation Award will support development of an analysis            
              of the potential failure mechanisms of thin coatings.  Three main              
              forms of failure will be considered: fracture of the coating or                
              substrate or of their interface, plastic flow in single and                    
              multiple loading, and failure by creep induced crack growth.                   
              Interfacial fracture of brittle coatings on brittle substrates will            
              be modeled using interfacial fracture mechanics.  For hard coatings            
              on a ductile substrate a shakedown limit method will be used to                
              calculate the cyclic plastic deformation of layered solids under               
              repeated contact loading.  In addition, models will be developed               
              to analyze time dependent crack and void growth in thin films under            
              high triaxial residual stresses.
