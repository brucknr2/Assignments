Abstract    :
                   This research project investigates methods for the systematic             
              development of concurrent programs, focusing upon formal methods for           
              specification, derivation, and refinement.  The project defines a              
              taxonomy of program development methods and uses it to classify and            
              study the existing methods.  Building on this study, the research is           
              synthesizing new methods which merge the strong features of the                
              existing methods with promising new techniques.  The project uses              
              several carefully chosen case studies to evaluate and refine these new         
              methods and then adapts the new methods to several different                   
              concurrent programming models.  This work is showing new ways that             
              existing theory and methods can be put into practice.  It also has the         
              potential for uncovering significant new formal methods for the                
              development of concurrent programs.  The research may also reveal the          
              possibility of innovative software engineering tools and educational           
              techniques.
