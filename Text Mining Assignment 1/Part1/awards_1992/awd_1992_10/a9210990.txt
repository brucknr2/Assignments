Abstract    :
              Exploring techniques which increase the power and efficiency of                
              object-oriented languages is the focus of this project.  The design            
              and implementation of Cecil (a multiple-dispatching, object-oriented           
              programming language) will play a central role in this research.  In           
              particular, programs which manipulate complex data structures will be          
              optimized.
