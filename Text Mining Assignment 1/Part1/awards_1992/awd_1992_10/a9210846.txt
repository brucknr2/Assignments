Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Prediction is of fundamental importance in all the sciences,                   
              including economics.  Forecast accuracy is of obvious importance               
              to users of forecasts because forecasts are used to guide                      
              decisions.  Comparisons of forecast accuracy are also of                       
              importance to economists more generally, who are interested in                 
              discriminating among competing economic hypotheses.  This project              
              is unified by concern with the forecasting of economic time                    
              series.  It develops new tools for building forecasting models,                
              constructing point and interval forecasts, evaluating forecast                 
              performance, and uncovering empirical macroeconomic regularities.              
              These tools are used in substantive macroeconomic applications.                
              This research is part of the economics of global change                        
              initiative because it contributes to the knowledge base of                     
              methods needed to enhance the credibility of future efforts to                 
              predict the economic impacts of global environmental change or                 
              the effects of policies designed to reduce greenhouse gas                      
              emissions.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              This project on modeling and forecasting economic time series has              
              eight interrelated parts: 1) markov-switching models; 2) exactly-              
              unbiased estimators and associated predictors in autoregressive                
              models; 3) low-frequency dynamics and long-memory models; 4)                   
              estimation of misspecified forecasting models; 5) comparing                    
              predictive accuracy; 6) assessing the predictability of economic               
              time series; 7) forecasting with cointegrated models; and 8)                   
              combining forecasts.
