Abstract    :
                   Atoms with two highly excited electrons display strong                    
              radial and angular correlations, behaving much like a single                   
              quasi-particle.  Earlier work is extended which will converge                  
              to the double ionization limit as the overall size of the                      
              system increases to infinity.  The results are directly                        
              relevant to experiments studying the double and triple                         
              ionization of atoms at low energy.
