Abstract    :
                   This research planning grant will enable the researcher to                
              continue her investigation into the structure of the ideal class               
              group of algebraic number fields. In particular, she will study how            
              the class group of a compositum relates to those of the subfields.             
                   This is research in the field of number theory.   Number                  
              theory starts with the whole numbers and questions such as the                 
              divisibility of one whole number by another.  It is among the                  
              oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for                 
              purely aesthetic reasons.  However, within the last half century,              
              it has become an essential tool in developing new algorithms for               
              computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics.
