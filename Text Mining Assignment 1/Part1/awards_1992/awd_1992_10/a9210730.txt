                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                  The basic aim of the project is to develop a computerized                 
              database of linguistic errors (slips of the tongue) produced by                
              normal and aphasic (post brain damaged) individuals.  Once                     
              established, the database will be made available to other                      
              investigators.  The interest in speech errors has grown                        
              enormously among linguists, psychologists, neuropsychologists,                 
              and neurologists in their attempts to understand how linguistic                
              knowledge is represented in the mind, how it is accessed in                    
              behavior, and the neurological basis for such representation and               
              processing.  Many individual collections are now in existence                  
              consisting of over 25,000 errors.  Except for published examples,              
              there has been no away of sharing these data; this project hopes               
              to correct this problem by starting a database with the UCLA                   
              Speech Error Corpus of over 15,000 items and the corpora                       
              collected by Merrill Garrett (University of Arizona) and Stefanie              
              Shattuck-Hufnagel (MIT), as well as a large corpus of aphasia                  
              errors collected by the Principal Investigator and/or published                
              in the literature.
