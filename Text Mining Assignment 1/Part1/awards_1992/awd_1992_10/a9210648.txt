Abstract    :
              9210648  Vemuri  The goal of the proposed research  is to develop a unified 
              computational framework for several  low-level vision problems which  fall
              under the generic  descriptions.  Formulations in  literature of a majority of
              these  problems lead to minimization of  non-convex functionals.  Existing 
              minimization techniques (stochastic  or deterministic) are either 
              computationally tardy or are  efficient only under certain  restrictive
              assumptions.   Hence,  there is a critical need to examine  alternate
              optimization techniques  that are not  susceptible to  pitfalls of the existing
               techniques, and the proposed  research is an attempt in this  direction.  This
              research is  concerned with the application of a  relatively new technique
              called  genetic algorithms (GAs) to a  variety of visual reconstruction 
              problems namely, stereo matching,  discontinuity preserving surface 
              reconstruction, and structure form  motions.  The proposed research  will focus
              on issues involved in  the analytical modeling of the GA  using Markov chains
              to facilitate  convergence analysis of the  algorithm when applied to Visual 
              Reconstruction problems.  The  theoretical work will be concluded  with
              algorithm implementation and  testing on real image data.  The  proposed
              unified computational  framework will significantly  advance the state of the
              art in  computational vision.  ***
