Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dystrophin related protein, DRP, is a large, recently identified               
              protein that is similar to dystrophin.  Preliminary studies suggest            
              that DRP is specifically localized in the brain to cells associated            
              with the blood-brain-barrier which is critical to maintaining the              
              normal physiological conditions in the brain.  Dystrophin is                   
              essential to the maintenance of muscle and DRP may well perform a              
              similar, significant role in maintaining the organization of                   
              membrane proteins in cells which compose the blood-brain-barrier.              
              High resolution light and electron-microscopic techniques will be              
              applied to characterize the distribution of DRP in the developing              
              and adult brain in vivo.  This information will help elucidate the             
              significance of this protein in the establishment and maintenance              
              of the blood-brain-barrier.
