Abstract    :
              The objective of the proposed research is twofold: (i) to                      
              theoretically understand and predict the radiation properties                  
              of thin metallic films from the fundamentals of microscopic                    
              electron transport and electromagnetic wave propagation, and                   
              (ii) to experimentally evaluate the radiation properties of                    
              such films. The theoretical study will evaluate radiation                      
              properties by analyzing coupled Boltzmann and Maxwell's                        
              equations. The experimental aspects will include fabrication                   
              of thin films of different materials and thicknesses by                        
              sputter deposition, comprehensive microstructure and surface                   
              characterization, and laser reflection and transmission                        
              evaluations.
