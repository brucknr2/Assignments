Abstract    :
              A new method for the analysis and design of time integration                   
              algorithms is to be developed.  This method will allow an algorithm            
              to be determined from a given set of error acceptability criteria              
              for the numerical response.  Basically, an algorithm will be                   
              analyzed as a filter which converts input (load) into output                   
              (response) and in the process distorts the response above which is             
              normally associated with the structural transfer function.  Thus,              
              a numerical transfer function is used to measure the effect in                 
              phase and amplitude measures for a particular integrator.  a                   
              parametric analysis of structural parameters (load, structure,                 
              load-structure interaction spectra) and numerical parameters will              
              be performed to obtain an overall view of how the method will                  
              perform under different situations.  Since the behavior of these               
              measures is a function of these parameters, appropriate integrators            
              and associated parameters can be chosen depending on individual                
              simulation characteristics in conjunction with defined error                   
              criteria.  This methodology will enable more realistic values of               
              timesteps to chosen as well as appropriate integrators.  The                   
              introduction of these more efficient methods will allow simulation             
              to be longer and finer in spatial resolution.  Ultimately more                 
              realistic simulations experiments.  Applications will include the              
              development of an integrator for dynamic fracture propagation which            
              involves a stiff system having both high accuracy requirements as              
              well as high and low frequency content.
