Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will support the 12th International Symposium on the              
              theory of Traffic Flow and Transportation to be held at the                    
              University of California (Berkeley) from July 21 to July 23, 1993.             
                                                                                             
              In response to the congestion problem in cities, the topic of the              
              first symposium was vehicular traffic theory.  This has been the               
              focus of the series, since the pressing need for congestion relief             
              has not disappeared, and advanced in traffic science can open the              
              door for solutions that do not require the construction of more and            
              more facilities.  With the same goal in mind, recent symposia have             
              examined subjects related to traffic flow, encompassing passenger              
              transportation modes other than the automobile.  The Berkeley                  
              symposium will continue this tradition, seeking papers in                      
              intelligent vehicle/highway systems (IVHS) and freight/logistics.              
                                                                                             
              The distinguishing feature of this symposium series is that it                 
              deals exclusively with the scientific aspects of transportation and            
              traffic phenomena.  As such it provided the World's                            
              transportation/traffic theorists with their main forum.
