Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to continue a successful Research                    
              Experiences for Undergraduates Site program in the Department of               
              Biological Sciences at the University of Missouri-Columbia.  The               
              Department will work in partnership with a select group of                     
              undergraduate institutions, including predominantly minority                   
              institutions, to provide students with the kind of research                    
              experience only available at a major comprehensive research                    
              university.  This REU program will complement an internship program            
              for MU students funded through a grant from the Howard Hughes                  
              Medical Institute.  Faculty participant's research programs center             
              on the theme "Cellular, Molecular and Genetic Approaches to                    
              Biological Problems," and utilize methodology raging from                      
              recombinant DNA technology, to immunocytochemistry, to                         
              sophisticated electrophysiology.  All participating faculty are                
              personally involved in their research projects, are well-funded,               
              and have a history of successful partnerships with undergraduates              
              interns.  While the research experience is the cornerstone of the              
              summer program,  multiple and varied opportunities for the students            
              to develop their communication skills, and the opportunity to                  
              present their research at local and regional scientific meetings               
              are provided.  Finally, a number of enrichment activities including            
              seminars by research faculty, an informal evening program "Science             
              and Scientists," and a panel discussion on selecting and applying              
              to graduate schools have been developed.
