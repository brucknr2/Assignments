Abstract    :
                   This grant supports the research of Professor Roger Baker in              
              analytic number theory.  Professor Baker will study a broad class              
              of problems in Diophantine inequalities around Weyl sums.  He                  
              will also study exponential sums via the values of Dirichlet                   
              polynomials and sieves.                                                        
                   The field of analytic number theory applies to the discrete               
              realm of the whole numbers the techniques of analysis, dependent               
              on the notions of continuity and limit, originating in calculus.               
              The idea of using continuous methods to investigate the discrete               
              is two centuries old, but with the work of the modern analytic                 
              number theorists, the field has had a new rebirth.
