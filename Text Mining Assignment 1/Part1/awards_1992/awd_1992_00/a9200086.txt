Abstract    :
              Conservation biology and population biology suffer from an almost              
              complete lack of information on how new populations of rare species            
              become established.  This project will investigate the roles of                
              dispersal and disturbance in the formation of new populations by               
              experimentally introducing seeds of 14 rare plant species into                 
              numerous sites at the Harvard Forest in Petersham, Massachusetts,              
              which appear to be suitable for the species but where the species              
              do not occur.  The sites will be censused in subsequent years to               
              determine if populations of rare species become established on                 
              these sites.  Transplants of seedlings and juveniles, exclosures               
              and other procedures will be used to identify the stages at which              
              population establishment fails in certain species and sites.  The              
              results will be important to restoration biology by developing new             
              methods to establish additional populations of rare species and so             
              prevent their extinction.
