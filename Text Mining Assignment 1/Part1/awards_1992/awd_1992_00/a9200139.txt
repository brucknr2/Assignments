Abstract    :
              The School of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science of                     
              Polytechnic University is continuing its undergraduate research                
              program in the areas of electrophysics and information systems.                
              Students are recruited from a variety of other schools, including              
              primarily undergraduate institutions.  The research environment is             
              enriched by additional undergraduate students funded from other                
              sources.  Each participant has regular meetings with an individual             
              faculty mentor to plan work and review progress throughout the                 
              eleven week program.  Project topics in electrophysics include                 
              microwave-plasma interaction, propagation of microwaves inside                 
              buildings and in urban radio channels, ultra-short pulsed laser,               
              computational electrophysics, and thin film devices.  Information              
              systems include image communication, multivariable feedback                    
              control, wireless information networks, robotics, adaptive                     
              filtering, target recognition in infrared images, and digital                  
              signal processing.  A monetary prize is awarded to the best                    
              project.
