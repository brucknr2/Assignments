Abstract    :
              The Purdue Schools of Chemical, Electrical, and Materials                      
              Engineering, which have been sharing undergraduate courses as well             
              as research on electronic materials and processing for several                 
              years will participate in a REU site in microelectronic materials              
              and processing.  The focus of the REU site is the synthesis,                   
              processing, properties, structure, and performance of                          
              microelectronic materials, and the interrelationships among these              
              aspects.  Specific projects include anisotropic etching of                     
              microelectronic thin films, selective epitaxial growth and three-              
              dimensional integration, processing on patterned substrates of                 
              electronic materials, fundamentals of metal contacts to                        
              semiconductors, and 'a priori' predictions of physical and chemical            
              properties of microelectronic materials as functions of their                  
              synthesis and processing.  The goals of the REU will be to                     
              introduce students to independent research on these materials and              
              device fabrication, to develop and enhance the students' creativity            
              and originality, to develop outstanding candidates for graduate                
              programs, to demonstrate the excitement and rewards from successful            
              research, and to prepare B.S. graduates who will excel in                      
              industrial research and development environments.
