Abstract    :
                     San Diego State University will conduct a university-level              
              research experience focused on modern geophysical exploration.                 
              Known as SAGE (Summer of Applied Geophysical Experience), this                 
              hands-on research will provide an advanced learning experience for             
              undergraduate and graduate students.                                           
                                                                                             
                     Students will participate for 4 weeks in the field segment in           
              the Rio Grande rift near Santa Fe, New Mexico, an area that                    
              provides stimulating tectonic research as well as an opportunity               
              to study occurrences of groundwater and hydrocarbons.  Research                
              uses seismic reflection and refraction, gravity, magnetics,                    
              electrical resistivity, electromagnetics, and magnetotellurics.                
                                                                                             
                     SAGE students will participate in every phase of the field              
              research from the collection and processing of data to its                     
              interpretation, culminating with both an oral and written report.              
              Where the required supervision is available at their home                      
              institutions, students will continue their research on their own               
              campuses.  This research is augmented by a visit to a SAGE faculty             
              member's campus and attendance at a scientific meeting.
