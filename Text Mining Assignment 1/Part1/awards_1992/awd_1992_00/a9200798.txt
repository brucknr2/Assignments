Abstract    :
              Ten undergraduates will be selected to participate in research                 
              projects on the Juneau Icefield, Alaska.  For more than 40 years,              
              research emphasizing geology, glaciology, geophysics, glacio-                  
              meteorology, geobotany, and surveying, has been conducted on this              
              icefield.  With cooperation between the University of Idaho's                  
              Glaciological and Arctic Environmental Sciences Institute and the              
              Foundation for Glacier and Environmental Research, this                        
              research/educational activity aims at a total systems study of                 
              one of North America's largest icefields.   Under supervision of               
              professors of unique experience, drawn from the University of                  
              Idaho and other universities, each undergraduate will select a                 
              research project and be encouraged to exercise as much                         
              independent judgment and initiative as possible in its                         
              development.  Undergraduates selected will be earth science                    
              students who demonstrate scholarly aptitude, motivation, and                   
              research potential.  The staff will be available throughout the                
              season for advice and help, including lectures, seminars and site              
              specific instructions in methodologies to insure and effective                 
              research experience.
