Abstract    :
              Bridges require routine inspection to detect flaws before they                 
              lead to damage and dangerous conditions.  The objective of this                
              project is the application of coherent laser vibration to                      
              detection of flaws by remote inspection.  The method will apply a              
              laser technique to  pinpoint flaws in individual structural                    
              elements of this bridge.  Phase I demonstrated the technique on                
              the total structure and was successful in detecting mechanical                 
              changes in the total system.
