Abstract    :
              The workshop will bring together approximately twenty people from              
              academia and industry.  The goal of the workshop is to identify                
              critical research topics in computer architecture as it relates to             
              high performance computing.  These topics will consitute a set of              
              "grand challenges" for computer architecture research and development.         
              The workshop will be held at Purdue University on December 11 to               
              13, 1991.  A report on the discussions and conclusions will be                 
              published.
