Abstract    :
              This program involves the theoretical and                                      
              experimental fluid-structure analysis of very                                  
              large floating structures (VLFSs). The                                         
              primary objective of the program is to                                         
              improve the understanding of VLFS response                                     
              and the capabilities to predictit.  A major                                    
              aspect of the work involves wave tank model                                    
              testing of six scale model VLFSs.  Data                                        
              obtained from these tests will include not                                     
              only basic motion response, but a detailed                                     
              description of the hydroelastic response.                                      
              The data will be use to validate numerical                                     
              techniques and to identify and evaluate                                        
              phenomena not included in the numerical                                        
              models.  New and existing numerical                                            
              techniques to predict the hydroelastic                                         
              response will be developed and refined, with                                   
              an emphasis placed on methodologies                                            
              appropriate for large scale, flexible,                                         
              floating systems.  The experimental data and                                   
              numerical models will be used to evaluate                                      
              various configurations and to develop general                                  
              guidelines for design.  A VLFS might have                                      
              plan dimensions on the order of 1,000x 3,000                                   
              m, which is a substantial increase in size                                     
              compared to existing floaters.  Because                                        
              comparable field data and experience is                                        
              nonexistent, this research is required for                                     
              the better understanding of the hydroelastic                                   
              response of VLFSs.  It must be carried out                                     
              prior to the design and construction of a                                      
              VLFS.
