Abstract    :
              This REU site is in Environmental Science and Engineering at                   
              Florida International University.  The objective is to stimulate               
              and promote interest, curiosity, creative and critical thinking of             
              undergraduate students in environmental science and engineering                
              during their early years in the undergraduate program.  This work              
              involves students in a comprehensive research program relative to              
              movement and dispersion of oil spills and treatment of contaminated            
              media to minimize potential damage to the environment.
