Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Laboratory research has contributed greatly to our understanding               
              of reproductive physiology and how it is regulated by external                 
              environmental factors such as day length, nutrition, exercise and              
              interactions with conspecifics.  However, in these studies, each               
              variable is considered independently and under controlled                      
              conditions.  This is clearly not the case in the natural habitat               
              where social and ecological factors are intertwined to influence               
              behavior and its physiological underpinnings.  To study physiology             
              under field conditions requires animal capture and blood-drawing               
              which are expensive and risky procedures that are traumatic for                
              both biologists and animals.  To overcome this major obstacle, Dr.             
              Gudermuth will develop and validate the use of fecal steroid                   
              analyses to characterize gonadal function in both domestic and wild            
              canine species.   This non-capture, non-invasive methodology                   
              provides a means to collect and process vital information                      
              concerning the reproductive physiology of animals living in their              
              natural habitat which would not have previously been possible.                 
              Moreover, this assay will have an enormous impact on field                     
              research, wildlife conservation and management, and practical                  
              aspects of veterinary care of dogs.
