Abstract    :
                   The PI is one of the world's leading authorities                          
              on spectral analysis/geometry and commands a reputation for                    
              superb technical expertise. Following on from previous work                    
              on heat equation methods, the PI will continue his work on                     
              the nodal sets of eigenfunctions of the Laplacian on                           
              Riemannian manifolds and particular boundary-value problems                    
              of Dirichlet-Neumann type.
