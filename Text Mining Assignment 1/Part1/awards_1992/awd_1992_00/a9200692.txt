Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is a doctoral dissertation project to study the                      
              discourse and collective action of anti-crime activists in order               
              to understand the social and institutional forces that engender a              
              fear of crime and the circumstances under which fear of crime                  
              gives rise to anti-crime activism.  The principal source of data               
              will be videotapes and transcripts of focus group conversations                
              with members of Boston area "crime watch' groups.                              
                   This study will contribute to ongoing debates about fear of               
              crime, and the politics of crime, and it will clarify the                      
              political effects of fear of crime and anti-crime activism by                  
              identifying the kinds of anti-crime initiatives that are likely                
              to receive broad public support.
