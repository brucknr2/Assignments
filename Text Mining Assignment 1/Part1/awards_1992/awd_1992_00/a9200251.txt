Abstract    :
              This workshop proposal will bring together US and Soviet experts               
              for purposes of comparing population and sociological data on rural            
              northern settlements in the Soviet Northeast and Alaska. These data            
              are essential for understanding northern community viability, and              
              problems such as violence, suicide, life expectancy and health care            
              delivery. The workshop will be the first significant data exchange             
              of Arctic demographic and vital statistics between Russian and                 
              American researchers, and will provide a basis for future joint                
              research within this critical area.
