Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The P.I. will conduct high pressure solidus-to-super solidus                   
              experiments on mantle peridotites in a Patterson-type apparatus in             
              order to quantify the roles of deviatoric stress and finite strain             
              in the formation of anisotropic melt distributions. A second goal              
              will be to determine the conditions at which a transition from                 
              porous flow to localized flow occurs in response to melt fracturing            
              vs, fluid dynamic instabilities. His ultimate objective is to                  
              obtain constraints on the mechanism of melt focussing at mid-                  
              oceanic ridges.
