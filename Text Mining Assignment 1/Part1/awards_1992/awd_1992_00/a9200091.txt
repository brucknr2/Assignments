Abstract    :
                  This project will bring eight students to the Loyola                       
              Campus.  They will be recruited from Loyola and several                        
              minority institutions in the New Orleans area.  The students                   
              will be divided into two groups of four each to work in the                    
              area of different software development methodologies (logic-                   
              oriented and object-oriented)using CASE tools.  The students                   
              will spend six weeks at Loyola in the summer of 1992, and                      
              then continue work, with assistance from faculty at their                      
              home institution, during the school year.
