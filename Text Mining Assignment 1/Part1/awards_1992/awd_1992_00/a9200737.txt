Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry at Western Kentucky University will                
              use this award from the Chemical Research Instrumentation                      
              Program to help acquire a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)                    
              spectrometer.  The areas of chemical research that will be                     
              enhanced by the acquisition include the following:                             
                                                                                             
              1.  Speciation of Sulfur Compounds;                                            
                                                                                             
              2.  Quantification of Drugs in the Presence of Cutting Agents;                 
                                                                                             
              3.  Identification and Quantification of Gases Envolved                        
                  During the Controlled Oxidation of Coals and Combined                      
                  Fuels;                                                                     
                                                                                             
              4.  FT-IR Analysis of Modified Coals and Coal Extracts;                        
                                                                                             
              5.  Relationship Between the Organic Structure of Coal and                     
                  Thermal Maturation.                                                        
                                                                                             
              %%%                                                                            
              Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is a technique                  
              that uses absorption of infrared energy to probe molecular                     
              structure.  When used in conjunction with a modern computer,                   
              FTIR studies on large numbers of samples can be conveniently                   
              carried out and the resulting data readily analyzed.  The use                  
              of FTIR spectroscopy is essential to chemists who are carrying                 
              out research in many important frontier areas.  The instrument                 
              will be used in undergraduate research.
