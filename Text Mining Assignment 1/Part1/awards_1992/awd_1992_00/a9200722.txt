Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Mechanisms of communication between cells constitutes one of the               
              most fundamental processes in all of biology. Intracellular                    
              communication plays an important role in endocrinology, immunology,            
              neurobiology, and control of cell growth and differentiation. This             
              intracellular communication is largely mediated by the presence of             
              specific receptors and signal transduction systems within the cell             
              or the cell surface. This conference  will review the most recent              
              current knowledge about these receptors and signal transduction                
              mechanisms. It will involve individuals from academic settings and             
              industry and from very senior level to indviduals still training.
