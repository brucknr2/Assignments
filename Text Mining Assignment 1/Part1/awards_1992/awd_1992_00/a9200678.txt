Abstract    :
                   The Department of Mathematics at the University of North                  
              Carolina at Charlotte will host the 1992 Spring Topology                       
              Conference from April 2-4, 1992.  The following are scheduled to               
              give one-hour addresses:  W.P. Thurston, S.C. Ferry, D.L.                      
              Sumners, L.G. Oversteegen, J.D. Stasheff, S.E. Newhouse, Jan van               
              Mill, F.X. Connolly, F.A. Raymond, Mike Reed, and Dmitri                       
              Shakmatov.  There will be an additional dozen half-hour talks and              
              numerous fifteen-minute talks.  Attendance in excess of two                    
              hundred is expected.                                                           
                   The series of conferences of which this is the latest member              
              have become important annual events for topologisis,                           
              particularly, but not exclusively (as the above roster                         
              indicates), those in general topology, point-set topology and                  
              continua theory.  The proceedings will be published in Topology                
              Proceedings, a refereed research journal published by Auburn                   
              University.  The external conference advisory committee consists               
              of Morton Brown (University of Michigan), Peter J. Nyikos                      
              (University of South Carolina), Mary Ellen Rudin (University of                
              Wisconsin), and Richard B. Sher (University of North Carolina at               
              Greensboro).                                                                   
                   A novel aspect of this year's conference is the one-day                   
              conference on issues in mathematical education to be held April                
              1, the day immediately before the regular sessions begin.  This                
              will capitalize on William Thurston's presence and his interest                
              in such issues.  Other more usual aspects of the conference                    
              arrangements seem equally well thought out.
