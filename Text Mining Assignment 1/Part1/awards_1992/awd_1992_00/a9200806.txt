Abstract    :
              This project provides for the continued operation and maintenance              
              of an automatic weather station network on the Greenland ice sheet             
              in support of the GISP-2 drilling effort and the associated                    
              atmospheric chemistry research.  Three AWS units are located at the            
              GISP-2, GRIP, and atmospheric camp sites, while four are located               
              100 km to the north, east, south, and west of the drill site.                  
              These are used to determine the regional divergence and vorticity              
              fields.
