Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The recent missions to comets Giacobini Zinner and Halley have                 
              resulted in a deeper understanding of the major physical and                   
              chemical processes involved in the solar wind interaction with a               
              comet.  The wealth of in-situ data necessitates a new level of                 
              theoretical modeling.  Dr. Flammer will study a number of                      
              outstanding issues in cometary physics which emphasize both                    
              macroscopic and microscopic processes.  The research goals are to              
              develop theoretical models to: (1) Study how the cometary pickup               
              ion distribution function modifies the global solar wind flow                  
              characteristics near a comet over a wide range of heliocentric                 
              distances; (2) Study both the macro and micro physics of the                   
              cometary ionopause and inner shock; (3) Study the interaction of               
              the solar wind with a comet at large heliocentric distances; (4)               
              Study the ion chemistry outside the cometary ionopause; and (5)                
              Study the interaction between dust and plasma in the cometary                  
              environment.  Dr. Flammer will use analytic theory, numerical                  
              techniques, and plasma simulation codes.  These investigations will            
              make use of the existing cometary data and provide insight for                 
              future cometary missions.
