Abstract    :
                   An REU Site will be established at the University of                      
              Toledo, Department of Physics and Astronomy for eight out of                   
              twelve total supported undergraduate students.  The students                   
              will be able to collaborate with departmental faculty in the                   
              fields of Astrophysics/Astronomy, Atomic/Molecular/-Optical,                   
              and Condensed Matter Physics.  The NSF-REU program will                        
              enhance the departmental undergraduate research program, which                 
              has been in existence since 1988, by providing full time                       
              summer support for the students, as well as allowing non-Univ.                 
              of Toledo students to participate in the research.
