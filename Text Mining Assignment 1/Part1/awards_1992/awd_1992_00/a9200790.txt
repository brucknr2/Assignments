Abstract    :
              While most optimizing compilers attempt to minimize the execution time         
              or the size of programs, little has been attempted in the area of              
              minimization of the storage needed by programs during execution.  This         
              project contains a framework for reasoning about data size in compiled         
              programs, and the investigator intends to formulate some space-saving          
              optimizations and implement them in Standard ML of New Jersey.
