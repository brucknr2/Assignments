Abstract    :
              Metal-plate connections are widely used in light-frame                         
              residential and commercial wood truss assemblies.  An                          
              investigation in to the static and dynamic behavior of these                   
              connections has become an urgent problem in view of the great                  
              damage to wood structures, mobile homes and prefabricated houses               
              subjected to hurricanes and extreme wind conditions.  This                     
              investigation will determine the limits of design for safe                     
              construction of wood structures.
