Abstract    :
                   Research in theoretical physics will include (1) analyses                 
              of elementary particle and other physical systems using the                    
              "lattice"  approximation, in which the continuum of space is                   
              replaced by a discrete lattice of points, (2) studies of                       
              chaotic behavior, and (3) analyses of physical systems whose                   
              descriptive equations can actually be solved exactly.  The                     
              lattice approach enables one to study situations in which, for                 
              example, the strong nuclear force is important and cannot be                   
              treated as a small perturbation.  Chaotic behavior is                          
              widespread in nature and little understood.  Study of systems                  
              whose equations can be solved exactly give one insight into                    
              physical systems generally.  Thus, all of these studies are                    
              important.
