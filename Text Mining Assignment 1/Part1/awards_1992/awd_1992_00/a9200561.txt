Abstract    :
              This grant is the study of photonic                                            
              waveguide devices and electronic                                               
              quantum-confined devices.  Because they                                        
              are based on the same wave nature, a                                           
              cross pollination effect can be expected by                                    
              linking them together.  The performances                                       
              and limitations of quantum-confined                                            
              devices will be studied.  Computer aided                                       
              design tools for future-generation electronic                                  
              devices will be developed.  New photonic                                       
              devices with applications in optical                                           
              communications systems will also be                                            
              explored.
