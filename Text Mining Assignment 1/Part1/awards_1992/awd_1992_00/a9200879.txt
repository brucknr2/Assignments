Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The principal investigators have developed short and long                 
              baseline tiltmeters through prior funding. Short baseline                      
              instrument performance has been documented in about ten ocean floor            
              deployments at drift rates on the order on one microradian per day             
              and sensitivity of 0.3 microradian. Initial laboratory tests of the            
              long baseline instrument indicate similar sensitivities are reduced            
              drift rates. The development and testing of these instruments will             
              continue. Engineering tasks included the extension of bottom time,             
              analysis of ground coupling and deployment characteristics,                    
              development of short baseline leveling table for including in the              
              long baseline instrument, and fine tuning the instruments in                   
              response to field tests.
