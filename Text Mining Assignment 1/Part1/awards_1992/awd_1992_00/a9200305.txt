Abstract    :
              The general objectives of this study are to develop a convenient,              
              easy to use computer system for calculating molecular phylogenies              
              by evolutionary parsimony, maximum parsimony, and transversion                 
              parsimony and to provide it to the systematics community.  We will             
              provide programs that run on standard IBM personal computers, on               
              IBM clones, and on apple computers, so that systematists can have              
              convenient access to these programs in their offices and                       
              laboratories.  This work is likely to catalyze rapid and innovative            
              advances because it will make available a new algorithm for                    
              reconstructing phylogenetic trees that is theoretically the most               
              robust yet devised.
