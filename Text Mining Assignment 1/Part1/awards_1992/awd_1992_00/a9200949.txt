Abstract    :
                   This research has two over-arching goals:  (1) to determine               
              the geohistorical factors that control the distribution of                     
              Caribbean inshore fishes and (2) to improve the scientific basis               
              for conservation of fishes, particularly in the Caribbean coastal              
              zone.  It arises from the discovery that many Caribbean fishes have            
              distribution s that conform to ancient geotectonic features rather             
              than to current ecological barriers.  Consequently, it is expected             
              that analysis of distribution patterns will be informative about               
              the origin of the Antillean fauna and about processes that were                
              fundamental in the formation of the Caribbean Basin.  The project              
              proposes to survey the poorly known inshore fish faunas of                     
              selected regions in the Caribbean Basin to delimit areas of                    
              endemism of both inshore and freshwater fishes on the Caribbean                
              Tectonic Plate, and to infer general patterns of area relationships            
              based on the interrelationships of the fishes.                                 
                   The sampling program that will address the biogeographic                  
              points above is precisely the same as that needed to develop                   
              management plans for Caribbean fishes.  In order to maximize the               
              project's contribution to conservation of fishes, surveys will be              
              directed at areas where marine biodiversity preserves are under                
              development, but where shorefish biodiversity has not yet been                 
              adequately assessed.  The project will result in taxonomic                     
              references, keys for identification, and analyses of geographic                
              variation that are needed for marine fish management.
