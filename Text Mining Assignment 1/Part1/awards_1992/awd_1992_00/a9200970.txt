Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              This effort will seek a resolution to the controversy on DOM                   
              measurements that have arisen due to the development of a high                 
              temperature combustion method.  Apparent differences may be due to             
              variable blank interferences and varying approaches to correction.             
              It appears that rigorous protocol, not only for sample collection              
              and preparation, but also for standardization and blank correction,            
              could bring disparate DOC values closer together.  It remains to be            
              seen whether the older wet chemical and UV methods really miss much            
              of the "new" DOC.  The HTC methods for DON are obviously less well             
              developed, but there is hope that with attention to monitoring of              
              nitrogen budgets in method development a more complete final                   
              product can be obtained that does give all of the DON.  There is               
              presently no clear indication that conventional methods for DON                
              give values much lower than HTC ones, but there are serious                    
              problems still to be resolved with the HTC methods.  The proposed              
              next step is an effort that will take approximately two years and              
              is based on recommendations arising from a community wide workshop             
              convened to address the issue.
