Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support for a multidisciplinary                         
              effort to develop the digital imaging microscope for the                       
              anlaysis and control of changes in molecular distribution                      
              underlying cell function.  We propose to enhance the spatial                   
              and temporal resolution of fluorescence imaging by                             
              developing new microscope and camera systems for imaging in                    
              the millisecond domain and by developing computational                         
              methods for further extending resolution.   We will develop                    
              methodology for quantitative analysis of  2-D, 3-D and 3-D                     
              time series fluorescence images and for determining error                      
              bounds on estimates of the concentration of a given molecule                   
              in a compartment.  We will provide a powerful capability for                   
              the measurement and analysis of images by integrating tools                    
              for image display and interaction with automated feature                       
              extraction algorithms.  We will develop tools to investigate                   
              the relationship of  two or more molecules with respect to                     
              one another.   We will incrased the algorithm computation                      
              speed to make the digital imaging microscope into a real-                      
              time device that allows interactive or automated control of                    
              experiments.  Finally, we will add to the instrument the                       
              ability to control and modify molecular distribution in                        
              living cells by controlled photolysis of  "caged" compunds.
