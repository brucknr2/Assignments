Abstract    :
                   The mathematics and physics departments at Williams                       
              College are planning to offer a REU program in theoretical                     
              physics:  one on quantum information theory and one on the                     
              structure of quasicrystals.  Six physics majors will                           
              participate in the program.  The project will have a strong                    
              interdisciplinary focus:  each physics student, in addition to                 
              joining one of the physics groups, will also participate in a                  
              group offered by the mathematics department, and mathematics                   
              students will be included in the physics groups.  At least two                 
              of the six physics students will come from other campuses.
