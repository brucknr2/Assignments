Abstract    :
              A research program to investigate the dynamics of hole and electron            
              trapping and detrapping in oxide defects/traps at room temperature and         
              below will be conducted. Trapping behavior will be studied over a range        
              of electric fields and incident light intensities, and the research will       
              attempt to detemine whether charge free regions in gate insulators are         
              defect free or represent coalesced tunneling regions at oxide                  
              thicknesses <6 nm.  The study will also address the distribution and           
              density of defects/traps in insulators which have also been exposed to         
              ionizing radiation levels that might be encountered during device              
              processing.  The research is intended to resolve several outstanding           
              uncertainties in this field, and to provide insight into the physical          
              meaning of neutral defects with cross sections much smaller than an            
              atomic dimension.

              This research addresses basic processes in electronic materials, and is        
              expected to result in a better understanding of these processes, and an        
              improved ability to fabricate semiconductor devices and integrated             
              circuits with higher performance and greater reliability.
