Abstract    :
              This award provides support to the Department of Biological                    
              Sciences at Wellesley College to continue a successful summer                  
              undergraduate research program.  Participants will be selected from            
              junior Biology, Biological Chemistry or Psychobiology majors who               
              have serious purpose and definite interest in independent work,                
              have sufficient course preparation and have shown ability to think             
              imaginatively and independently.  Participants will be selected by             
              the project director and faculty committee after evaluation of                 
              applications forms designed to recruit the best qualified students             
              for particular projects.  The student will participate in all                  
              aspects of the investigation, from pursuing a literature review to             
              carrying out experimental procedures and observations, continuing              
              in analysis of data and determination of conclusions.  The students            
              will formally and informally discuss the work with the advisor, and            
              also will prepare discussions with all fellow participants, both               
              student and faculty, for weekly group seminars.  This will                     
              encourage both experience with oral presentations and exposure to              
              suggestions and criticism of other researchers.  Research reports              
              at the end of the program will involve a written paper, a poster,              
              and colloquia presentations to students and faculty during the next            
              academic year.  Throughout the summer, seminars will be presented              
              by women scientists in research careers in academia, industry and              
              medicine; field trips to biotechnology and chemical companies will             
              be taken.
