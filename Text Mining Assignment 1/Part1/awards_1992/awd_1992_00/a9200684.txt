Abstract    :
                   This grant will allow the Marie Selby Botanical Gardens (MSBG)            
              to transfer its unique collection of 65,000 dried epiphytic plants             
              (plants that grow on other plants) to new, improved facilities                 
              (cabinets and compactor system) in conjunction with a move to a                
              new, climate-controlled building.  The MSBG collection is known                
              nationally and internationally, especially for its collection of               
              orchids and bromeliads, and is well used in education and in                   
              applied and basic research on epiphytes.  The new facilities will              
              also allow growth in MSBG activity for at least the next 10 years.
