Abstract    :
                   Professors Meyerhofer and Eberly will carry out a joint                   
              experimental and theoretical study on the interaction of strong-               
              field laser pulses with atoms and ions.  The experimental work                 
              concentrates on high-field ionization and the nature of higher-                
              order harmonic generation.  The theoretical work will emphasize                
              the interpretation of photon-emission and electron-photon                      
              correlations during strong-field ionization.
