Abstract    :
                   A Research Experiences for Undergraduates site will be                    
              established through this award to support six undergraduate                    
              researchers engaged in mathematical research in the area of                    
              computer algebra.  The focus of the work will be on the                        
              description of surface intersections and the relationship of                   
              Grobner bases to the development of effective algorithms to solve              
              algebraic and geometric problems.  Symbolic computation will play              
              a major role in the advancement of this  research.  The location               
              of the project, the Institute for Computational Sciences and                   
              Informatics is ideally suited for this undertaking.                            
                   Students will be encouraged to report on their findings at                
              regional meetings of the professional societies.
