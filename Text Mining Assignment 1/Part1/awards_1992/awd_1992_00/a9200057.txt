Abstract    :
              The Marquette University Department of Electrical and Computer                 
              Engineering has a REU Site program involving eight students.  The              
              students have a research experience working on one or more research            
              projects which involve the examination/modification/improvement of             
              existing algorithms and the development/implementation of new                  
              algorithms for speech feature extraction in noise, antenna design              
              and scattering analysis, solid state system modeling, power device             
              and system design, and neural network modeling.  The research                  
              experience includes individual instruction in necessary background             
              information, participation in regular seminars of their active                 
              research groups, familiarity with the research literature in their             
              areas, oral communication of their research results in appropriate             
              seminars, and a final written research report.  The goal of the                
              Program is to start the participants on the path to become                     
              independent researchers and to motivate them to pursue graduate                
              studies.
