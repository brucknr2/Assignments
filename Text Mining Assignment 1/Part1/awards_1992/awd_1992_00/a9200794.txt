Abstract    :
                   A formal foundation for real-time computing will be                       
              developed.  Five directions will be pursued in the hope of                     
              increasing the scope of applicability and reducing the cost of                 
              current methodologies for the construction and analysis of                     
              time-critical systems.  Theoretical issues associated with the                 
              analog-clock model will be investigated.  A satisfactory theory                
              of finite-state computation has already been developed for a                   
              digital-clock model; the use of analog clocks would permit                     
              proofs of more precise real-time guarantees and would support                  
              compositional proof methods.  Second, investigations will be                   
              undertaken to reduce the cost of model checking by exploiting                  
              symbolic relationships between time delays.  Success in this                   
              endeavor would allow an important class of program verification                
              techniques be applied to a larger class of problems than is                    
              presently possible.  Further, time-bounded temporal operators                  
              will be used to classify timing constraints and to develop                     
              temporal proof rules for new classes of real-time properties.                  
              Fourth, investigations will commence into the verification of                  
              so-called hybrid systems - systems that contain both discrete                  
              and continuous processes.  Finally, freeze quantification, a                   
              byproduct of the study of real-time logics, will be applied in                 
              time-independent domains.                                                      
                  The ultimate goal of this line of research is to provide                   
              the system designer with a wide range of tools that support the                
              production of computing systems with predictable timing                        
              characteristics.
