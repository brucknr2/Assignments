Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support a survey of low frequency spectral lines               
              from the southern portion of the plane of our Galaxy.  The lines               
              are produced by the recombination of ionized carbon atoms into very            
              high quantum states with principal quantum numbers between 272 and             
              768; the corresponding frequencies of the lines are 325 MHz to 14.5            
              MHz.  The atoms producing these lines are extremely large and                  
              fragile with diameters up to 50 microns.  Such atoms can exist only            
              under the benign conditions found in cool interstellar clouds, and             
              they are extremely sensitive to their environment.  For this reason            
              they are excellent diagnostics of temperature, pressure, and                   
              ionization levels in cool interstellar clouds.  All previous                   
              observations have been made with northern hemisphere telescopes.               
              This survey will cover the southern portion of the galactic plane              
              and the Magellanic Clouds using the Parkes telescope in Australia              
              in order to discover more line emitting regions.
