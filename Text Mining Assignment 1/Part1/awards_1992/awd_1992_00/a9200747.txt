Abstract    :
              Data from the National Science Foundation-sponsored monitoring                 
              sites of ultraviolet and visible radiation in Antarctica and                   
              Barrow, Alaska will be used to determine the relationship between              
              biologically effective ultraviolet radiation, ozone abundance and              
              cloud effects.  Satellite data on ozone abundance and cloud                    
              properties will be used in a radiative transfer model to compute               
              the ultraviolet radiation budget at these sites.  Comparison with              
              the ground-based measurements will be made to determine the                    
              feasiblity of assessing the biospheric ultraviolet radiation                   
              environment in the polar regions from space.  Climatological                   
              estimates of the surface albedo will then be used to assess how                
              the ultraviolet and visible radiation budget varies with season                
              throughout the Antarctic and Arctic regions.  The relative                     
              magnitudes of UVB (280-320 nm), UVA (320-400 nm), and                          
              photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, 400-700 nm) will be                  
              assessed as a function of latitude and season and climatological               
              parameters (turbidity, cloud cover, etc.).  Finally, a coupled                 
              atmosphere/ocean radiation model will be used to estimate the                  
              amount of ultraviolet and visible radiation penetrating to                     
              various levels in the polar ocean as a function of ocean                       
              productivity.
