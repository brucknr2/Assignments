Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A combined modeling and experimental program of research will                  
              be conducted on various topics relevant to near-wall                           
              turbulence. The primary tools are Particle Imaging Velocimetry                 
                                                                                             
              and Direct Numerical Simulation. Topics include high Reynolds                  
              number channel flow, flow over a wavy wall, flow oscillatory                   
              in time, and flow with polymer injection for drag reduction.                   
              Wall shear stress in separating and reversing flows will be                    
              measured with electrochemical methods.                                         
                                                                                             
              Complex turbulent flows are relevant to a very broad range of                  
              industrial processes in Mechanical and Chemical engineering,                   
              and there is still a low degree of reliability in predicting                   
              their characteristics due to the complexity of turbulence.
