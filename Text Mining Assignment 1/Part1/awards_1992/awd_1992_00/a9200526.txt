Abstract    :
              Hayes         This research deals with obtaining a fundamental  understanding of
              how to use hierarchy effectively in testing (as  it is used in design).  The
              three integrated components of the  research are:  1.     how to design and
              control propagation of precomputed test  stimuli to each module of the circuit
              from the circuit inputs and  propagation of responses from the module to the 
              circuit outputs;  2.     development of test-preserving transformations of
              circuits  which allow a circuit design to be changed during synthesis while 
              preserving the fault coverage powers of a known or transformed  test set; and 
              3.     finding methods for designing built-in-self-testing circuits  to provide
              localized input stimuli generation and response  analysis for modules.        
              Theorems and algorithms are being developed.
