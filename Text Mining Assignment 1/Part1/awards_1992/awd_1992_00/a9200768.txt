Abstract    :
                This grant is to provide partial support for a two-day workshop              
              entitled "Frontiers of Broad Band Seismology" jointly sponsored                
              by the University of California at Berkeley and the California                 
              Institute of Technology.  It will be held on January 9-10, 1991,               
              in Berkeley, California.  Recent advances in the technology of                 
              broad-band seismic instrumentation have led to a revolution in                 
              the design and installation of seismic arrays in the western                   
              United States.  Major advances in our knowledge of earthquakes                 
              and the interior of the earth are possible from this new                       
              capability.  The workshop will facilitate data storage and                     
              formatting and ensure access to the massive amounts of                         
              information that will be generated.  It will also provide a broad              
              spectrum of both U.S. and international scientists an opportunity              
              to develop and extend strategies for analysis in future research.              
              This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard                 
              Reduction Program.
