Abstract    :
                   Although prokaryotes are ubiquitous and immensely important               
              biologically, the diversity of marine communities is almost                    
              unknown.  A major obstacle is poor culturability required for                  
              standard identification.  This proposed project will survey                    
              planktonic prokaryotes in several ocean locations, with the                    
              objective of classifying them by means of 16S rRNA gene sequences              
              obtained direct from biomass. This approach has provided an                    
              extremely broad phylogenetic framework of classification, and is               
              the only one that can now be used without culturing the                        
              organisms.  The results are in the form of sequences, interpreted              
              via phylogenetic analysis.  Previously, the Principal                          
              Investigator and others have applied this approach to a few open               
              ocean samples, and major new taxa have already been discovered                 
              (e.g. an archaebacterial group whose nearest known relatives are               
              as evolutionarily distant as animals are from plants).  It is                  
              likely that other novel major taxa, as well as additional members              
              of better-characterized ones, are awaiting discovery.  The                     
              proposed project will extend these studies to deep sea, coastal,               
              polar, and coral reef habitats that have not previously been                   
              examined this way.  The Principal Investigator has already                     
              collected most of the samples, and funds will be used for work-                
              up and analysis.  The results can be used in preliminary tests of              
              hypotheses in ecology, biogeography, and phylogeny, but primarily              
              will serve as a framework for future such studies.
