Abstract    :
              The Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site project                  
              is in the area of Materials Chemistry.  For a three-year period                
              beginning in 1992, ten undergraduate students will spend ten                   
              weeks each summer engaged in research activities, ranging from                 
              synthesis of new materials to characterization of their                        
              physical and chemical properties.  The goal of this program and                
              its unique feature - its concentration on highly-qualified                     
              women - will ultimately introduce into graduate programs women                 
              who have been directly involved in the creative fusion of                      
              Chemistry and Materials Science.
