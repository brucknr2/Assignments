Abstract    :
                   This project involves basic theoretical research on                       
              electrical networks having infinitely many branches.  Presently                
              there are far more unanswered questions than established results               
              in this area.  The theory of transfinite networks - networks                   
              obtained by connecting many infinite networks at their infinite                
              extremities -is in its infancy and requires further development.               
              A method for solving linear infinite grids with n-dimensional                  
              nonuniformities (n . 2) is needed.  There is presently no                      
              efficient way of analyzing infinite nonlinear resistive grids.                 
              The same is true of infinite LRC networks, not to mention                      
              nonlinear ones.                                                                
                   These and other problems, if solved, would contribute to the              
              advancement of our meager knowledge of infinite networks, but                  
              will also have impact in several other fields, such as exterior                
              boundary value problem, discrete harmonic analysis,                            
              classification of Riemann surfaces and operator theory.
