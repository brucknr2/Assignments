Abstract    :
              This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                  
              chemistry and in the subfield of nonlinear spectroscopy.  During               
              the tenure of this three-year continuing grant, Professor Wright               
              and his students will investigate the utility of non-degenerate                
              multi-wave mixing spectroscopies for new mode-selective and                    
              component-selective analyses.  Mode selection is achieved by using             
              multiple lasers to enhance spectroscopic transitions of molecules              
              that are coupled to fixed vibrational resonances.  Spectral line               
              narrowing and component selection results from enhancing                       
              spectroscopic transitions of molecules that are coupled to fixed               
              electronic resonances.  This research extends Professor Wright's               
              previous four-wave mixing investigations into the infrared,                    
              including the fingerprint region, where selective spectral                     
              enhancement of specific conformers will be explored.  The                      
              feasibility of six-wave mixing techniques that have potential for              
              the selective enhancement of specific Raman transitions will also              
              be investigated.

              This research lays the groundwork for the development of new                   
              analytical spectroscopic probes for complex chemical and                       
              biological systems.
