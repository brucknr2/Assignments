Abstract    :
                   Site grant support is requested for a Research Experience for             
              Undergraduates (REU) program.  The program gives undergraduates                
              majoring in physics and closely related disciplines experience in              
              the various geoscience research fields, with an emphasis on high-              
              latitude studies.  Many of the interns are the best students from              
              small liberal arts colleges, and this program is likely their only             
              opportunity for in-depth exposure to geophysics research before                
              they make decisions regarding graduate school.  In this program,               
              interns are assigned to work with individual principal                         
              investigators on assigned projects.  In addition, there is an                  
              organized series of weekly lectures and field trips to expose                  
              interns to other fields beyond the scope of their own project.                 
              Clerical support is also requested to continue a running survey of             
              the impact of previous REU programs on educational and career                  
              choices of former interns, dating back to 1987.
