Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to The Infant Study Center and Visual                
              Research Lab in the Psychology Department at Brooklyn College to               
              continue a successful REU-SITE which offers students a research                
              experience which focuses on many aspects of the visual system.                 
              Together with a colleague from Medgar-Evers College of CUNY,                   
              mentors will constitute a REU-Site aimed at students who might be              
              persuaded by their research experience to continue to the doctorate            
              in Experimental and Developmental Psychology, and related areas in             
              the Neurosciences.  Both institutions have many women and minority             
              students as well as special programs to attract and guide such                 
              students; heavy emphasis will be placed on recruiting among them.              
              The training program includes laboratory seminars, an active role              
              in a specific research "team", and public presentations of results.            
              The research areas are all heavily computerized and instrumented:              
              (i) Development of infants' abilities to focus their eyes on                   
              objects around them (i.e., mechanisms of accommodation and                     
              convergence); methods will include quantitative photorefraction.               
              (ii) Brain mechanisms associated with vision.  Visual evoked                   
              potentials will be recorded to examine the maturation of                       
              physiological systems, especially those involving the lateral                  
              interactions that are so important for object recognition.  (iii)              
              Color vision, particularly the use of scaling techniques to specify            
              color appearance under a variety of viewing conditions, such as                
              changes in retinal position; results will be related to known                  
              variations in anatomy and physiology across the retina.
