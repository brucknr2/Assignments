Abstract    :
                   The Joint Institute of Laboratory Astrophysics (JILA) and                 
              the Department of Physics will conduct a summer program                        
              introducing 12 undergraduates to active, on-going research.                    
              The 19 participating faculty are well-recognized contributors                  
              to the fields of Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics,                        
              Gravitational and Geophysics, Condensed Matter Physics,                        
              Elementary Particle Physics, and Nuclear Physics.  Half the                    
              students will be selected from colleges and universities in                    
              Colorado and the contiguous states; half will come from the                    
              University of Colorado.  Special efforts will be made to                       
              solicit applications from minorities, particularly in                          
              Colorado.  The students will be expected to master at least a                  
              part of a large task.  Once a week all students will gather to                 
              discuss their work informally.  At the end of their 10-week                    
              employment they will give short seminars describing their work                 
              and write a report.  Students from smaller colleges will be                    
              exposed to graduate students here, thus encouraging the                        
              undergraduates to continue their education.
