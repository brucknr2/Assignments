Abstract    :
              The National Nanofabrication Facility (NNF) at Cornell University              
              is an interdisciplinary center, the primary role of which is to                
              provide resources and technical expertise to researchers in                    
              microstructures science, particularly in the areas of advanced                 
              lithographies, nanostructure physics, scanning tunneling microscopy            
              for fabrication and analysis, optoelectronic and electronic                    
              applications, microfabrication applications to biology, and related            
              areas.  The NNF REU site is a program of discrete projects for                 
              undergraduates, conducted over a ten week period under the                     
              supervision of academic mentors at Cornell whose research is                   
              associated with the Facility.  In some cases, NNF facilities are               
              used for only a small, but crucial, part of the fabrication or                 
              experimentation.  In all cases, the attraction of NNF is the                   
              quality and open access to resources, and the ability to accomplish            
              complex or unusual microfabrication in a routine way.  The REU                 
              program takes particular advantage of ongoing NNF educational                  
              activities as well as interaction with other REU programs campus-              
              wide.  Several events are planned to encourage interaction with                
              other REU students on campus, and some NNF participants will work              
              in teams or collaboratively with students in other programs.  All              
              students are required to prepare a brief final report and to                   
              present their results at a concluding Forum of their peers and                 
              mentors.
