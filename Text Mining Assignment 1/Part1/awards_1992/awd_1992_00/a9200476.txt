Abstract    :
              The ability to expand the research opportunities for undergraduate             
              students to participate in some of the advanced research                       
              laboratories in the Bradley Department of Electrical Engineering               
              at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia               
              Tech) is the basis for this REU site.  The summer program is                   
              specifically designed to provide opportunities predominantly to                
              students from historically black colleges and universities, but not            
              exclude students from other institutions.
