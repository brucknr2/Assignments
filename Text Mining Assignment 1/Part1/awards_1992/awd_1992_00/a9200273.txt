Abstract    :
                   A group of symmetries of a space X induces symmetries on                  
              certain algebraic invariants of X (so-called homology                          
              representations).  In this way, transformation group theory (the               
              study of the symmetries of continuous objects, such as spaces) and             
              representation theory (the study of symmetries of discrete or                  
              algebraic objects) become intimately related.  The goal of this                
              project is to investigate systematically the interactions between              
              the geometry of symmetries (such as fixed points) and their                    
              algebraic manifestations.  In particular, the problem of existence             
              of symmetries of Moore spaces with prescribed algebraic                        
              representations (the Steenrod Problem, posed in the early 1960's),             
              algebraic surfaces, and certain 4-dimensional spaces all provide               
              concrete problems to which a general theory should apply.                      
              Techniques from topology, algebraic geometry, and representation               
              theory should interact fruitfully in this endeavor.                            
                   Symmetry plays an absolutely fundamental role in science (in              
              fact, in art and music as well), and we attempt to understand this             
              role through qualitative and certain quantitative measurements and             
              comparisons.  In mathematics, symmetry plays a fundamental role                
              also, and it has many different but related manifestations.  To                
              have a precise and logical understanding of symmetries of a                    
              mathematical structure, such as a space, we need to discover and               
              quantify its so-called invariants and other important features.  A             
              wide variety of sophisticated tools of this trade, chiefly                     
              algebraic ones, have been developed over the years in different                
              research projects, and this investigator is adept at and plans to              
              draw upon a surprising number of them in his current work.
