Abstract    :
              This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project                
              is in the area of chemistry.  Beginning in 1992, eight                         
              undergraduate students will spend ten weeks in the summer                      
              engaged in research under the direction of various members of                  
              the faculty in Chemistry.  This program will allow students to                 
              participate in active research programs applying chemistry to                  
              materials science.  The goal of the proposed program is to seek                
              and attract bright undergraduate students, particularly                        
              minority students. It will actively involve these students in                  
              research programs that will develop and encourage them to                      
              pursue science careers, particularly chemistry, ultimately                     
              leading to a Masters or Ph.D. degree.
