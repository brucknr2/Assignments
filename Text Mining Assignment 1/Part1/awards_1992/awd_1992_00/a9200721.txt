Abstract    :
              This conference on Yeast Chromosome Structure, Replication                     
              and Segregation is being held under the auspices of the Federation             
              of American Societies of Experimental Biology (FASEB) from July                
              5-10, 1992 at Snowmass Colorado.  The meeting will follow the                  
              guidelines established by the first FASEB conference held on this              
              subject August 5-10, 1990. Participation will be limited to 155                
              scientists chosen from applicants on the basis of their expertise              
              and interests as being most likely to create a stimulating and                 
              informative meeting.  There will be nine major scientific sessions.            
              In addition, an afternoon session will be devoted to discussion of             
              the complete DNA sequence analysis of S. cerevisiae chromosome III.            
              Remaining afternoons will be devoted to poster sessions and                    
              informal workshops.                                                            
              %%%                                                                            
              This meeting will fill an important niche for scientists interested            
              in yeast chromosome replication and segregation by allowing                    
              extensive communication between laboratories at an important time              
              in this rapidly developing field.
