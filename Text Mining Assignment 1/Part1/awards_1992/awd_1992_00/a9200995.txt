Abstract    :
                   The principal investigators will continue their study of the              
              homotopy of instanton moduli spaces. They will use the                         
              relationship between instantons and holomorphic bundles to                     
              continue work related to their recent solution of the Atiyah-                  
              Jones conjecture. The principal investigators will also study                  
              families of compact, non-homogeneous Einstein manifolds of                     
              positive scalar curvature.                                                     
                   This award will support research in the general area of                   
              differential geometry and global analysis. Differential geometry               
              is the study of the relationship between the geometry of a space               
              and analytic concepts defined on the space. Global analysis is                 
              the study of the overall geometric and topological properties of               
              a space by piecing together local information. Applications of                 
              these areas of mathematics in other sciences include the                       
              structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas boundaries, and                 
              the large scale structure of the universe.
