Abstract    :
              The award provides partial support to organize and publish the                 
              proceedings of the "Engineering Foundation Conference on                       
              Dispersion and Aggregation:  Fundamentals and Applications"                    
              (March 15-20, 1992 in Florida).  The objective of the                          
              Conference is to bring together researchers, users and                         
              equipment manufactures from different disciplines to shear new                 
              developments in the field.  The basic principles of dispersion                 
              and aggregation are similar in paper and pulp, paints,                         
              minerals and other industries.  Outstanding university                         
              researchers and industry representatives will have the                         
              opportunity to review the state-of-the-art and new technology                  
              in this field.
