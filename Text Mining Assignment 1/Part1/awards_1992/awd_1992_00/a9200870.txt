Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Extensive transport measurements are proposed on oriented, doped               
              films of "YBCO".  A unique and important feature is the measurement            
              of, in addition to other more conventional parameters, the                     
              "electrical Bernoulli coefficient" which identifies the sign of the            
              sc charge carriers.  The goal is to develop a complete picture of              
              electronic transport and thereby enhance their understanding of the            
              phenomenon of oxide superconductivity.
