Abstract    :
              This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface                 
              Chemistry Program, addresses questions of the detailed dynamics                
              of gas-surface interactions.  The objectives of the research                   
              are to develop an understanding of the detailed dynamics of                    
              dissociative chemisorption of simple diatomic molecules, and                   
              the recombination and desorption of adsorbed atoms from well                   
              characterized solid surfaces.  Velocity resolved, polarization                 
              sensitive multi-photon ionization detection of scattered                       
              diatomic molecules and desorbed molecules resulting from atom                  
              recombination will be carried out.  Novel studies of                           
              chemisorption of monoenergetic, aligned reagents will also be                  
              pursued.                                                                       
              %%%                                                                            
              Dissociation of molecules on surfaces, as well as recombination                
              and desorption of molecules from the surface, are the principal                
              elementary processes which underlie a wide range of important                  
              technologies, including catalysis, corrosion, and electronic                   
              device fabrication.  This research project develops and applies                
              state-of-the-art methods to the study of the detailed dynamics                 
              of these elementary processes.  The information gained from                    
              these studies is essential in developing our basic                             
              understanding of these critical technologies.
