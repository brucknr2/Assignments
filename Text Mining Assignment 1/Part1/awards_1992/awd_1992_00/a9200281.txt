Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Although some of the barriers preventing women from entering              
              science and engineering careers have diminished or disappeared                 
              over the last several decades, the number of women scientists and              
              engineers in the United States is still disproportionately small.              
              Results of the Phase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)               
              study establish the technical basis for a new educational tool,                
              an interactive Compact Disc - Read-Only Memory (CD-ROM) program,               
              Outlooks, that has as its purpose the introduction of students to              
              women scientists and scientific careers.  Through audio, photos,               
              illustrations and text, the prototype imparted to students                     
              significant and inspiring information:  They were getting to know              
              top women scientists, to learn about their exciting work on a                  
              personal basis, and to find out what it takes to become a                      
              scientist.  The research objectives of the Phase II research                   
              focus on (1) planning and designing the format, content, and                   
              technical approach of prototype software; (2) producing Phase II               
              prototype packages (the CD-ROM and the teacher's guide); and (3)               
              conducting development, implementation and impact studies.  The                
              work will provide a multimedia CD-ROM program highlighting the                 
              accomplishments of women in science and an audiovisual resource                
              for science and career education in an engaging, interactive                   
              format.
