Abstract    :
              An SGER award will permit testing the feasibility of using                     
              buckminsterfullerene (C60 and C70) ions in ion-assisted deposition             
              of MgF2 antireflection optical coatings at relatively low                      
              temperatures.  It is anticipated that these ions may provide                   
              suitable energy transfer to the optical films to force dense growth            
              - resulting in optimal wear and optical properties - at                        
              temperatures at which plastic optical components are stable.  It               
              is also expected that the buckminsterfullerene ions will leave                 
              minimal chemical residue and mechanical damage in the film.
