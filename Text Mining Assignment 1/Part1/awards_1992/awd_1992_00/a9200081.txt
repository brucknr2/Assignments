Abstract    :
              Much attention has been focused recently on the apparent worldwide             
              decline in amphibian populations.  While the decline of some                   
              species may be attributed to habitat destruction, a perplexing                 
              number of declines have taken place at protected reserves on all               
              major continents. Although the mostly anecdotal evidence for                   
              worldwide declines is compelling, studies providing quantitative               
              data on changes are required in order to understand and mitigate               
              the source or sources of biological trauma responsible for the                 
              declines.                                                                      
                   The present project undertakes such a study for Lower Central             
              America (Panama and Costa Rica), where spectacular declines among              
              amphibian populations were among the first to be recognized.  The              
              study will involve:  resampling previously investigated sites                  
              following the original sampling protocols; establishing a series of            
              attitudinal transects in areas of obvious declines and where                   
              declines are not evident for future repeated sampling; and sampling            
              individual species believed to be particularly sensitive to                    
              environmental deterioration.  Data obtained from the sampling                  
              program will demonstrate the extent of decline, whether the entire             
              amphibian association or only a subset is affected and whether an              
              apparent difference between upland localities (marked decline in               
              many species) and lowland (no clear declines overall) sites is                 
              real.  It is anticipated that the project, the first regional study            
              of amphibian declines utilizing a repeatable, quantitative                     
              approach, will answer fundamental questions as well as serving as              
              a model for similar comparative studies in other geographic                    
              regions.
