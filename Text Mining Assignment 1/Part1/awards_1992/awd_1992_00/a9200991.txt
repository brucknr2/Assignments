Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A numerical simulation technique based on molecular dynamics                   
              is to be applied to a variety of phenomena involving fluid-                    
              solid and fluid-fluid interfaces at very small scale                           
              resolution. Earlier research by the investigators will be                      
              extended and generalized. The study will apply the model to                    
              the dynamic contact line between two immiscible fluids and a                   
              solid boundary, including roughness effects and precursor                      
              films. Coalescence and splashes will be modeled, as will the                   
              matching of calculations on these very small scales and the                    
              remainder of the fluid on a much larger, bulk scale.                           
              Structured molecules will be added to the model to account for                 
              complex rheological effects.                                                   
                                                                                             
              The study will clarify wetting, film rupture, phase separation                 
              and phase change phenomena, all of which are of importance in                  
              a variety of processes in Chemical and Mechanical Engineering.
