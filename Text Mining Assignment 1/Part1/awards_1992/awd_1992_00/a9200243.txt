Abstract    :
                   This effort consists of installing a low.end                              
              McIDASWorkstation in Kuwait City, enabling                                     
              (asynchronous)communications between the workstation in Kuwait                 
              and McIDASmainframe facility in Madison, Wisconsin.  It is                     
              anticipated thatNOAA personnel will dial into the mainframe                    
              facility and downloaddata on demand.  Besides METEOSAT, other                  
              data relevant to thedispersal of the smoke are also available via              
              McIDAS (e.g. NOAA.11 and 12 AVHRR imagery, surface and upper air               
              data from the Gulfstations, NMC forecast products, etc.), which                
              will also beaccessible from Kuwait.  SSEC provided similar                     
              capability inBahrain in support of the University of Washington                
              and NCARaircraft during May and June of this year.                             
                   A McIDAS workstation located in Kuwait would also be a                    
              veryuseful research tool.  It would allow the scientists                       
              locatedthere to investigate the effects of the smoke on the                    
              localweather including: the effects of the smoke on visibility                 
              andtemperatures, the predictability of the smoke based on the                  
              localconditions, the probability of "black rain" in the coming                 
              wintermonths, etc.. The workstation can also provide a means                   
              ofexporting local data such as those gathered on the 15                        
              towersinstrumented by NOAA for use by scientists in the US                     
              through themainframe McIDAS.  Other research opportunities                     
              include theinvestigation of the impact the smoke has on Kuwait's               
              environmentas well as the impact of dust storms on local                       
              activities such asaviation.
