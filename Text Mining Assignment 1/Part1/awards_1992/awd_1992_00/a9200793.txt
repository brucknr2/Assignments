Abstract    :
              This is an Industry-University Collaborative Research project,                 
              between the Ohio State University (P.I. L.-S. Fan) and Amoco                   
              Oil Co. (Dr. D. Arters) in the area of high-pressure high-                     
              temperature three-phase fluidization.  The experiments in                      
              university will be conducted on a small apparatus.  Pilot                      
              scale experiments will be performed at Amoco to examine the                    
              scale effects.  It is proposed to visualize the three-phase                    
              flow microstructure and study the pressure and temperature                     
              effects in Newtonian and non-Newtonian systems, in two- and                    
              three-dimensional fluidized columns.  Bubble dynamics,                         
              including bubble coalescence and breakage, will be an area of                  
              focus.  Particle image velocimetry will be used in a mixture                   
              of fluid and solids with the same refractive index.  The                       
              effect of pressure on the bubble wake, as well as other                        
              microstructural aspects of three-phase flow will be                            
              investigated for the first time.                                               
                                                                                             
              If successful, the proposed research on three-phase                            
              fluidization at high pressure and temperature will extend the                  
              current limits of application of this approach in chemical                     
              synthesis, energy production and biotechnology.
