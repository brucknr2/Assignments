Abstract    :
              The objective of the REU program at the University of California,              
              Irvine, is to provide hands-on experience in active research to ten            
              undergraduate students.  The undergraduate students will conduct               
              research in combustion and propulsion under the guidance of a                  
              supervising faculty member.  A special attribute of the program is             
              the close alliance of the research to 1) practical application, and            
              2) industrial collaboration.  A second special feature of the                  
              program is the fostering of independence in research; the                      
              development of communication skills; the promotion of intuitive and            
              innovative skills; experiences in budgeting, purchasing, and                   
              scheduling; and the development of accepting, adapting to, and                 
              resolving the challenges that arise in the conduct of research.                
              The selection process is geared to promote the involvement of                  
              students of Chicano heritage and females.
