              This workshop on Solar Terrestrial Energy Program's (STEP)                     
              Electrodynamics and Composition of the Mesosphere                              
              coordinated by Drs. Robert Holzman of the University of                        
              Washington-Seattle and A. M. Feigin, Institute of Applied                      
              Physics, Nizhny, Novgorod, Russia will be held at the                          
              Institute in Nizhny in March 1992.                                             
                                                                                             
              The Upper Atmospheric Research Section at the NSF is                           
              committed to cooperation with the international STEP                           
              program and through its support of scientists in related                       
              research activities plays a central intellectual role in                       
              meeting STEP objectives.  In particular the objectives                         
              relating to the composition of the mesosphere and the                          
              electrodynamics of the atmosphere are ones that have                           
              received strong recent emphasis and in which very                              
              significant recent progress has been made.                                     
                                                                                             
              The items to be discussed include preliminary results of                       
              NCL-91 compain; relation between electrodynamics and                           
              chemistry of the D-region; polar mesospheric clouds                            
              (PMSC), relation between NCL and PMSC, mesospheric                             
              electrodynamics and global electricity, and                                    
              electrodynamics and minor constituents.                                        
                                                                                             
              This project fulfills the program objective of advancing                       
              scientific knowledge by enabling leading researchers in                        
              the United States and Russia to combine complementary                          
              efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual                             
              interest and competence in the field of basic scientific                       
              research on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and                            
              mutuality of benefit.
