Abstract    :
              The New York Botanical Garden, with over 5 million plant                       
              specimens, is an essential resource for botanical research in the              
              U.S. and internationally, providing vast service to national and               
              international community of scholars and students.  The garden is               
              strongly committed to its collections and research activities, as              
              indicated by the long range plan to expand into a new wing in                  
              1996 and to begin computerization of the vast holdings.  This                  
              grant will enable the Garden to maintain its enormous                          
              loan/visitor program and to provide expansion capabilities until               
              the new building is completed in 1996.  Also this support will                 
              allow hitherto unstudied and underused parts of the collection--               
              lichens and fungi--to be identified, curated and used in the                   
              botanical research and education.
