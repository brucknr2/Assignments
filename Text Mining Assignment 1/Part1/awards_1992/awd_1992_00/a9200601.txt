Abstract    :
              This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project                
              is in the fields of chemistry and biochemistry.  For a                         
              three-year period beginning in 1992, each of eleven                            
              undergraduate students will do "hands-on" research under the                   
              direction of a faculty member who will be matched with the                     
              student.  Students will be immersed in an intensive 10-week                    
              summer program which has been carefully planned to provide a                   
              positive working environment and to enhance: (1) the students'                 
              interest and fascination in chemistry and biochemistry; (2) the                
              students' technical skills in the laboratory; (3) their ability                
              to design and interpret experiments; and (4) their ability to                  
              communicate verbally and in writing.  The research experiences                 
              will extend beyond the summer and continue throughout the                      
              academic year, with a second full-time laboratory period during                
              the semester intersession.
