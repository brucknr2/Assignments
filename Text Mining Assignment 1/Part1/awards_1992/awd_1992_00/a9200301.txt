Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This two year award will support research in computational                     
              geometry and development of an associated software package in a                
              novel area of three dimensional modelling called alpha-shapes.                 
              It is expected that this qualitatively new kind of volume                      
              visualization software will be useful to many disciplines.  The                
              research component of this grant will be carried out under the                 
              direction of Dr. Herbert Edelsbrunner, who developed the concept               
              of alpha-shapes.  The software development will be coordinated by              
              Ping Fu of the National Center for Supercomputing Applications,                
              an NSF supercomputer center with long and successful experience                
              in workstation software development.
