Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site Award at the            
              University of Pittsburgh.  The funds provide support for eight                 
              undergraduate students selected from candidates from six colleges              
              in the general area of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to allow                      
              participation both in the summer and during the academic year.                 
              Special emphasis is placed upon recruitment from institutions                  
              having all female students, in order to attract more females into              
              careers in research and teaching.  Students from departments of                
              physics, chemistry, and engineering are considered.  Scholastic                
              achievement is the primary requirement for participation in the                
              program.  The research will involve research in the area of                    
              computer simulation and modeling of polymer behavior using Monte               
              Carlo and molecular dynamics techniques.  The professors involved              
              in this program have a strong record of interaction with                       
              undergraduate students in research, and have won honors for joint              
              publications in the past.
