Abstract    :
              Fundamental issues in large-grained parallel/distributed                       
              symbolic mathematical computation shall be explored.  The                      
              overall goal is the effective parallelization of symbolic                      
              algebra in a variety of parallel architectures.  For this, a                   
              version of the Maple system using C/Linda shall be employed as                 
              will a small-grain parallel version of the SAC2 algebra                        
              system.  The final system and library shall be put in                          
              distributable form for researchers interested in parallel                      
              symbolic mathematical computation.
