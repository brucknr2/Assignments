Abstract    :
                   The interactions among quantum field theory, string theory,               
              algebraic geometry, and topology are of great current interest.                
              Among the topics to be encompassed by this project are: (1) two-               
              dimensional gravity and cohomology of moduli spaces, and their                 
              relations with matrix models, topological field theories and                   
              "dessins;" (2) mirror symmetry and its consequences in string                  
              theory and algebraic geometry; (3) two-dimensional string theory               
              and non-compact sigma models; (4) solvable gauge theories and their            
              applications in mathematics; and (5) elliptic cohomology and its               
              generalizations.                                                               
                   This project will support the Conference on Geometry and                  
              Quantum Field Theory to be held from March 26-29, 1992 at Johns                
              Hopkins University.  A pre- and post-conference workshop will also             
              be held.  The conference activity will be held in conjunction with             
              a special year on these topics, hosted by the Japan-U.S. Institute             
              at Johns Hopkins.  The major topics to be covered by the conference            
              include two-dimensional gravity, mirror symmetry, two-dimensional              
              string theory, solvable gauge theories, and elliptic cohomology.
