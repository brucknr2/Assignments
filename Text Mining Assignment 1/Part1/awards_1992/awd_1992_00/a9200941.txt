Abstract    :
                   This grant supports the Quebec-Vermont Number Theory                      
              Seminar.  The participants in this seminar come from both                      
              research institutions and principally undergraduate institutions               
              in both the United States and Canada.  This grant will allow the               
              seminar to continue its tradition of inviting outstanding number               
              theorists to report on the most exciting new results thereby                   
              benefiting the research of the student and faculty participants.               
                  Number theory, the study of the properties of the whole                    
              numbers, is the oldest branch of mathematics.  In modern days,                 
              problems in number theory have furnished the driving force to                  
              creation of new mathematics in the fields of pure algebra,                     
              analysis, and geometry; some of the most recent and most                       
              astonishing applications of number theory have appeared in                     
              theoretical computer science and coding theory.
