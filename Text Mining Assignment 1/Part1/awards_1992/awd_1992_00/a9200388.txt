Abstract    :
                   This Research Experiences for Undergraduates award provides               
              support for an eight student project run jointly by Hope and                   
              Calvin Colleges. Seven faculty at these institutions will                      
              supervise research in diverse areas of mathematics and statistics              
              including analysis, topology, dynamical systems, geometry and                  
              combinatorics.  To provide a common activity, students and                     
              faculty will conduct a seminar on polynomial invariants and links              
              during the term of the first year's program.                                   
                   Examples of individual research projects include the                      
              embedding of finite lattices in the recursively enumerable                     
              degrees, determinantal rings associated with 5x5 and 6x6                       
              symmetric matrices, sums of multiplicative operators on spaces of              
              continuous functions and pseudo-orbit shadowing of dynamical                   
              systems.  Each project lends itself to computational                           
              experimentation and rigorous mathematical analysis.                            
                   During the final weeks of the program, students will present              
              their results.  They will be encouraged to continue their studies              
              during the academic year, develop publishable manuscripts and to               
              seek opportunities to discuss their work at regional mathematics               
              meetings.
