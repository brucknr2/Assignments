Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The dramatic success of the export-oriented industrialization                  
              strategy of the East Asian countries based on inexpensive labor                
              enabled these countries to rapidly attain the status of newly                  
              industrializing countries (NICs).  The assessment of the potential             
              of these countries to move from the semi-periphery to the core of              
              the capitalist world economy depends on assembling empirical                   
              evidence at both the level of within-country and that of across-               
              countries.  With this evidence the nature and extent of                        
              expansionism of core transnational corporations (TNCs) of a given              
              industry can be estimated and utilized to facilitate                           
              disentanglement of the complex patterns of the industrial mobility             
              of NICs in the world economic system.  This doctoral dissertation              
              project will make a cross-country inter-industry comparison by                 
              comparing Korea with Latin American cases over the last three                  
              decades and a within-industry comparison by studying the divergent             
              market strategies toward transnational corporations that the three             
              Korean automobile manufacturers--Hyundai, Daewoo, and Kia--took in             
              order to provide a solid empirical foundation for explicating the              
              global functioning of transnational corporations and the impact                
              that they have had on the Korean automobile industry.  Statistical             
              and historical data from the Korean automobile manufacturers and               
              government agencies with be combined with data from interviews with            
              engineers, economists and managers at the auto companies and with              
              auto experts and economic and social historians in order to                    
              illuminate the developmental process.                                          
                                                                                             
                   This project will contribute to social scientific                         
              understandings of the paradoxical relationship between dependency              
              and development and of the process of industrialization from a                 
              world system perspective.  This project also will provide an                   
              excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar to continue to             
              develop independent research skills.
