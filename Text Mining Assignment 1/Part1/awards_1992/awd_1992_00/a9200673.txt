Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the                       
              Chemistry Division, Gilbert will investigate the spectroscopy                  
              and photochemistry of various nitrogen-containing compounds,                   
              such as energetic halogen amines, aminyl radicals, and                         
              nitrenes.  NX2, NXY, and NX species will be trapped in low                     
              temperature matrices for spectroscopic and photochemical                       
              characterization, while the photochemistry of several NX3 and                  
              NX2Y species will be studied in the gas phase.  Ultraviolet/                   
              visible absorption and laser-induced fluorescence spectra will                 
              be obtained from the matrix-isolated species to characterize                   
              their electronic states as well as to aid in understanding the                 
              photodissociation dynamics of the gas-phase amines and their                   
              intermediates.                                                                 
              %%%                                                                            
              The family of nitrogen-containing compounds known as halogen                   
              amines is interesting because these compounds are notoriously                  
              unstable under standard conditions of temperature and                          
              pressure.  The reasons for this behavior are not understood,                   
              but certain trends are observed, such as increasing                            
              instability in going from compounds containing fluorine to                     
              those containing chlorine, bromine, and finally iodine.  An                    
              understanding of these issues in the halogen amines may aid in                 
              elucidating the chemical nature of other nitrogen-bearing                      
              species.
