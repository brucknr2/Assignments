Abstract    :
                   The University of Nevada, Reno, with its outstanding                      
              interdisciplinary program in the areas of hydrology, hydrogeology              
              and water resources, and with strong affiliation and interaction               
              with the Deseart Research Institute, will conduct this REU program             
              in such a way as to exchange ideas, discuss data, and assist in                
              cross discipline "fertilization".                                              
                                                                                             
                   Students will participate for 10 weeks during the summer.                 
              Each week students will meet in a seminar format.  In addition,                
              during most of the program the students will meet in a semi-                   
              informal "research group" setting to discuss their own research                
              results, interact with the other students and faculty advisors                 
              and/or have laboratory demonstrations of equipment.  Faculty will              
              give overviews of their research programs.  Emphasis will be placed            
              on how student and faculty research fits into the bigger,                      
              interdisciplinary picture of hydrological sciences.                            
                                                                                             
                   During the last week the seminar and research group meeting               
              will be combined so that the REU students synthesize their                     
              information, and practice their communication skills by presenting             
              their results.
