Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              A station to receive, archive and process high resolution images               
              from the NOAA polar-orbiting satellites will be installed on                   
              board the R/V Thompson and operated during the JGOFS cruises.                  
              Images of sea surface temperature will be generated and will be                
              accessible on the ship to support field studies requiring real-                
              time satellite coverage.  After post-cruise quality control, the               
              images will be published on CD-ROMs for distribution to all JGOFS              
              investigators.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              A domain extending from 12.5oS to 12.5oN and 130oW to 145oW will               
              be covered.  Processes that can be observed in this domain                     
              include the upwelling tongue along the equator and the                         
              Intertropical Convergence Zone at 8oN.  The data will be used for              
              statistical studies of the formation, evolution and decay of                   
              surface temperature patterns, as well as for process-oriented                  
              studies for which simultaneous shipboard sampling is available.
