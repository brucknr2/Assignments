Abstract    :
              The Fellow will study trace element and isotopic composition                   
              of mantle xenoliths in order to determine the mechanism for                    
              modification of the mantle by dubduction-derived fluids  and                   
              mantle melts.  Studies will be conducted in island arcs of Japan               
              and the Cascades through examination of whole rocks and minerals               
              for trace elements and radiogenic isotopes.  The Fellow will work              
              at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology during the tenure of              
              his fellowship.
