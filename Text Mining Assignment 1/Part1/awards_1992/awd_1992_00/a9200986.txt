Abstract    :
              An investigation of the effect of bridging groups on the                       
              magnetic properties of high-spin organic molecules will be                     
              conducted. Emphasis will be placed on defining the structural                  
              parameters which are necessary to maximize coupling of multiple                
              spin centers in organic molecules. A program of targeted                       
              synthesis of specifically defined high-spin precursors will be                 
              coupled with measurements of the magnetic properties of the                    
              resultant high-spin molecular species: this will establish the                 
              type of bridging groups which most effectively couple via an                   
              intramolecular process. A highlight of the research will be the                
              development and subsequent evaluation of magneto-optical                       
              switches which are capable of rapid changes in magnetic                        
              properties when exposed to appropriate wavelengths of light.

              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                      
              continuing investigations of Professor D. A. Dougherty at the                  
              California Institute of Technology. These studies will be                      
              focused toward the synthesis and design of organic molecules                   
              which exhibit magnetic properties when exposed to heat or                      
              light. The target molecules, which are effectively known as                    
              organic magnetic switches, will be evaluated for their magnetic                
              properties by utilization of specialized equipment designed to                 
              operate at liquid helium temperatures. Advances in this field                  
              will provide the basic information required to develop organic                 
              magnets with unique optical properties for utilization in                      
              electronics applications.
