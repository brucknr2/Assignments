Abstract    :
              The ten week summer REU program at Clemson University is intended              
              to provide a group of eight outstanding students with an                       
              opportunity to participate in highly individualized bioengineering             
              research activities.  Although the program is geared to                        
              undergraduate engineering students who may consider graduate                   
              training in bioengineering, exceptional students from other                    
              pertinent physical and biological science disciplines will be                  
              encouraged to enroll in the program, as future bioengineers.  The              
              program is designed to provide the students with a step-wise                   
              scenario of a mini-research project.  This will entail:  a) having             
              basic topical instructions pertinent to bioengineering; b) hands-              
              on exercise in literature search and outlining of plans for a                  
              research project; c) exposure to general and specific laboratory               
              techniques used in bioengineering research; d) observing and taking            
              part in the planned research activities, recognizing important                 
              aspects of being a team member among research experimentalists, and            
              making on the spot decisions in the laboratory environment; and e)             
              recording, analyzing, presenting technical data, as well as making             
              technical judgements on results with supported conclusions.                    
              Program attributes and associated impact include encouraging                   
              outstanding engineering and science undergraduate students to                  
              pursue graduate training in bioengineering and preparing                       
              undergraduate students who are to seek the job market with valuable            
              research experience.
