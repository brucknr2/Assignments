Abstract    :
                   The American building industry has undergone dramatic changes             
              during the past decade.  The U.S. building industry is fragmented              
              which has been the barriers to advance the technology development              
              in the building design.  To increase the competitiveness of the                
              building industry, an Industry/University Cooperative Research                 
              Center would provide a mechanism to accelerate the technology                  
              transfer to the commercial practice.  Such an effort will provide              
              a research base to develop the technologies needed for the                     
              innovations to occur in the building industry.  Carnegie Mellon                
              University's Industry/University Research Center for Building                  
              Performance and Diagnostics is addressing these needs.                         
                   The Center program will address components of advanced                    
              communications and office technologies in relation to the building             
              performance (acoustic, visual, thermal, spatial, and air quality)              
              problem.  The initial research agenda of the Center will address;              
              1) international building studies, 2) development of an innovative             
              process for building delivery, and 3) development and                          
              implementation of a state-of-the-art Electronic Material Technology            
              demonstration building.                                                        
                   There are nine company sponsors for the Center committing                 
              approximately $450,000.                                                        
                   The Principle Investigator/Center Director and his colleagues             
              are internationally recognized experts and have the knowledge and              
              facilities to run this center.                                                 
                   This Industry/University Cooperative Research Center is being             
              cost shared and coordinated with Dr. John Scalzi, Program Director,            
              Structures & Building System Programs.                                         
                   The Program Director recommends Carnegie Mellon University be             
              awarded $75,000 for the first year of a five-year continuing award.            
                   Near the end of the first year the Program Director will                  
              review the progress of the Center on  a number of criteria,                    
              including the following: 1) the extent to which the university-                
              industry interaction is developing; 2) the extent to which the                 
              support base is developing; 3) the extent to which a robust                    
              research program is developing.  If the review is satisfactory, the            
              Program Director will recommend support for the next period of this            
              continuing award.
