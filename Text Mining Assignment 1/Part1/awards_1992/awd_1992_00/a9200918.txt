Abstract    :
              This research is concerned with the extending the capabilities of              
              probabilistic networks as the basic mechanism of representing and              
              managing uncertainty in automated reasoning applications.  The                 
              project consists of three parallel investigations: 1. The                      
              formalization of relevance and causation using extensions to the               
              theory of graphoids. 2. The mechanization of qualitative non-                  
              monotonific reasoning based on sound probabilistic semantics.  3.              
              The automatic recovery of causal structures from data.
