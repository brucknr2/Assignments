Abstract    :
                   The Association of Systematic Collections is sponsoring a                 
              workshop on Sharing of Collections-based Data and Database                     
              Ethics.  As data associated with natural history collections are               
              increasingly used for research, conservation, resource                         
              management, and other purposes, there is a compelling need to                  
              explore the opportunities and constraints for data exchange.  The              
              funding of computerization and network projects suggests that                  
              there will be enormous growth of data sharing in the near future.              
              However, current patterns of data sharing, recent problems within              
              natural history collections and elsewhere in the scientific                    
              community, and expressed concerns all indicate that there are                  
              serious unresolved issues that limit willingness of institutions               
              to allow free access to collections data.                                      
                   These issues will be addressed in the format of a workshop                
              preceded by a series of introductory lectures, and followed by                 
              publication of guidelines by ASC.  Participants will come from                 
              the academic and museum communities, the conservation community                
              and other users of collections-based data, database                            
              professionals, commercial interests, and experts in legal and                  
              ethical aspects of data exchange.  The workshop will be held at                
              the AIBS meeting in Honolulu, Hawaii, on August 10-11, 1992.  In               
              addition to invited participants, there will be opportunities for              
              open participation.
