Abstract    :
              This REU site focusses summer research efforts of ten talented                 
              undergraduates on projects relating to synthesis and processing of             
              advanced engineering materials.  The faculty team assimilated for              
              this research spans the Aerospace/Mechanical Engineering and                   
              Manufacturing Engineering departments.  Participants will be                   
              selected primarily from two groups: 1) former participants in a                
              college-funded Freshmen Research Opportunity Program, 2)                       
              undergraduates at schools participating in 3/2 cooperative                     
              agreements.
