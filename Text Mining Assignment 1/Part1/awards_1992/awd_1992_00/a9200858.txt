Abstract    :
                   The purpose is to develop a language and methodology for                  
              specifying the requirements and design of concurrent distributed               
              real-time systems, including the monitored and controlled                      
              physical environment.  A new, complete, and executable notation,               
              called communicating real-time state machines (CRSM), is                       
              proposed as a basis.  They are essentially state machines that                 
              communicate synchronously over one-directional channels; in                    
              addition, CRSM has a novel and small set of facilities for                     
              describing timing properties and for accessing real time.                      
                   The research consists of five related parts.  The first is                
              to define further and implement the basic CRSM model.  Another                 
              is to develop a structuring scheme that permits the composition                
              of machines and their parts into higher level entities.  A third               
              is to design a methodology that combines the state-based CRSM                  
              approach with an object-oriented model.  A fourth part of the                  
              research is to develop formal reasoning methods and tools, for                 
              proving and testing assertions about specifications.  Lastly,                  
              specification experiments will be performed on some substantial                
              applications.
