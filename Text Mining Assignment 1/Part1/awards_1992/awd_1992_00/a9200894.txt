Abstract    :
                   The project outlines plans to complete the inventory of the               
              vascular plants of La Selva Biological Station, one of the                     
              world's finest tropical field stations.  When initiated in 1979,               
              the Station was less than half its current 3800 acres (=1510 ha)               
              of largely lowland tropical rainforest.  It was then estimated                 
              that La Selva would yield a flora of approximately 1800 species                
              of vascular plants and that number is being rapidly approached.                
              Nearly 1700 species are on current checklist and approximately 80              
              additional species are in various stages of study.  Most of these              
              require additional material to complete their identification.                  
              Perhaps a dozen are new species joining the more than 60 already               
              described from La Selva collections.  Although the greatest                    
              effort and time will be expended on description preparation and                
              comparative study, it seems imperative to continue collecting                  
              because 1) the majority of the collecting was made when La Selva               
              had less than half its present area and especially 2) land                     
              acquisition has increased the area not only by 12% but added a                 
              unique and uncollected forested ridge.  A very preliminary survey              
              indicated that these areas bear a number of species otherwise                  
              unknown at La Selva.                                                           
                   Because La Selva is representative of the vast Caribbean                  
              lowland rainforest which is rapidly being converted to pasture,                
              the flora will: 1) have a major impact on understanding Meso-                  
              american floristics, and 2) serve as much-needed tool for the on-              
              site evolutionary and ecological research by the numerous                      
              investigators utilizing the La Selva Biological Station each                   
              year.
