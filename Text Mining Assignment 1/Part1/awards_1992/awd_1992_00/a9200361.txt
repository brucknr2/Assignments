Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to Northern Arizona University to                    
              establish a Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site in the                
              areas of neural and behavioral sciences.  The research internship              
              is complemented by an integrated educational program that provides             
              training in research design statistics, reading complex scientific             
              literature, introduction to advanced technologies in research                  
              design and implementation, seminars in the history and philosophy              
              of science, and an integrated lecture-discussion series that covers            
              the range of research topics in neural and behavioral sciences.                
              Scientists from the Department of Biology and the Department of                
              Psychology will sponsor 12 internships for Native American                     
              undergraduate students.  The Department of Occupational and                    
              Technological Education and the Department of Engineering will                 
              provide training in advanced technologies, including basic computer            
              training and training in the application of computer assisted                  
              design systems for production of research software and                         
              instrumentation.  The Science and Mathematics Learning Center will             
              also provide training in the basics of experimental design,                    
              statistics, reading scientific literature, scientific and technical            
              writing, and collaborative learning.  Scientists from all                      
              participating departments will contribute lecture-discussion series            
              on neural and behavioral research.
