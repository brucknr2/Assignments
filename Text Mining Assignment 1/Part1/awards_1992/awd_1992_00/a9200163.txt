Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to the Department of Biological Sciences             
              at Carnegie Mellon University to continue a successful Research                
              Experiences for Undergraduate SITE.  The Department conducts                   
              research in cell biology, genetics, molecular biology,                         
              developmental biology, biochemistry and biophysics.  Each student              
              will carry out an original research project devised by a faculty               
              mentor who is a leader in his or her area of expertise.  Students              
              will also attend a special seminar series and workshops ranging                
              from honor in science to applying to graduate school, and present              
              the results of their research at a concluding symposium.  Students             
              will be recruited from colleges and universities all over the                  
              United States.  Special efforts will be made to recruit students               
              from liberal arts colleges and the recruitment of a significant                
              number of minority students and women is a major goal.  Selection              
              of students will be based upon academic criteria (SAT or ACT                   
              scores), letters of recommendation, as well as the students' stated            
              interest in research.  For the 1992 summer research program, the               
              CMU administration has pledged $30,000 in supplemental university              
              funds.  These funds will be used to support an increased number of             
              student participants.  The number of participants in 1992 will be              
              approximately 15 to 18.
