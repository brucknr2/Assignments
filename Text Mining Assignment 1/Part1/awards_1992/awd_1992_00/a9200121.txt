Abstract    :
              An experimental  study is proposed to explore the dynamics of                  
              shear thickening and microstructural changes in suspensions of                 
              uniform particle.  The effects on the onset and magnitude of                   
              shear thickening of the continuous phase viscosity, particle                   
              size, particle density and volumn fraction will be explored.                   
              Both repulsive and attractive interaction potentials will be                   
              studied using model suspensions where the pair potential can                   
              be characterized from low volume fraction studies.                             
              Microstructures will be studied with small angle neutron                       
              scattering (SANS) and optical scattering techniques.  Evidence                 
              of shear rate or stress induced structural phase transitions                   
              and the existence of metastable viscosities will be sought.                    
              The kinetics of such transitions and their effects on                          
              rheological behavior will be investigated.                                     
                                                                                             
              The structural changes occurring in suspensions with                           
              increasing shear rate and resulting increases in viscosity                     
              (shear thickening) are important in a wide range of                            
              technologies involving processing of dense suspensions.
