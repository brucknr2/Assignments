Abstract    :
              This proposal provides partial support for the conference on                   
              "Combinatorial Pattern Matching (CPM)", to be held in Tucson, Arizona          
              April 29- May 1, 1992.  Combinatorial Pattern Matching addresses               
              issues of searching and matching of strings and more complicated               
              patterns such as trees, regular expressions, extended expressions,             
              etc.  The goal is to derive nontrivial combinatorial properties for            
              such structures and then to exploit these properties in order to               
              achieve superior performances for the corresponding computational              
              problems.  This area is expected to grow even further due to the               
              increasing demand for speed and efficiency that comes especially from          
              molecular biology and the Genome project, but also from other diverse          
              areas such as information retrieval (e.g., supporting complicated              
              search queries), pattern recognition (e.g., using strings to                   
              represent polygons and string matching to identify them), compilers            
              (e.g., using tree matching), data compression, and program analysis            
              (e.g., program integration efforts).Two quite successful CPM Meetings          
              have been held already.  CPM 90 was held in Paris and CPM 91 in                
              London.
