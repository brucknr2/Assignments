Abstract    :
              This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project                
              is for research activities in all the subfields (organic,                      
              physical, analytical, inorganic, and biochemistry) of                          
              chemistry.  During the summer of 1992, twelve undergraduate                    
              students will spend ten weeks engaged in research under the                    
              supervision of their faculty, graduate student, or postdoctoral                
              fellow advisors.  A unique feature in this REU activity is use                 
              of a graduate student or postdocoral fellow as a "peer" mentor                 
              to help the student get started in the laboratory.
