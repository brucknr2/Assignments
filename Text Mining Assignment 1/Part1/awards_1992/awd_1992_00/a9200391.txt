Abstract    :
              In a cooperative effort between the National Solar Observatory at              
              Sunspot, New Mexico, and the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP),            
              junior and senior electrical and computer engineering students                 
              spend the summers working on design projects at UTEP and at the                
              observatory.  At present, observatory personnel do not have the                
              time or resources to retrofit or redesign existing equipment that,             
              although marginal, functions at an acceptable level.  This opens               
              the door for many student design projects aimed at optimizing                  
              existing equipment.  These projects include the design of a seeing             
              monitor for observing solar phenomena and a CCD camera interface.
