Abstract    :
                    This project involves a group of students working in                     
              peleontology, sedimentary petrology, and geochemistry. The research            
              project on environmental geochemistry is especially topical,                   
              interesting and diverse enough to offer a range of research choices            
              to the students who work with him.  It will deal with the                      
              environmental geochemistry of surface waters of a river in Georgia             
              and Alabama.  Other students may be involved with an additional                
              project examining and interpreting fossils to determine                        
              paleocurrent directions, faunal dispersion, and evolutionary                   
              development.
