Abstract    :
              This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project is             
              in the field of chemistry.  For a three-year period beginning April            
              1992, ten (10) undergraduate students will spend ten (10) weeks                
              engaged in basic research under the direction of the faculty                   
              members in the Chemistry Division.  By design, the scope of the                
              research projects within the chemistry department extend from basic            
              scientific research for theoretical advancement to applied research            
              on system design and technological development.  Most importantly,             
              the research opportunities for the NSF-REU undergraduate                       
              participants will encompass all of the major disciplines of                    
              chemistry; Inorganic, Organic, Physical, Analytical and                        
              Biochemistry.  The range of projects that would be available to                
              participating students include a full range of chemical,                       
              theoretical, biophysical and instrumentation approaches to the                 
              advancement of polymer science.  Our plan is to place great                    
              emphasis on matching the students with mentors who have similar                
              scientific interests.  Several department members are involved in              
              joint research projects with scientific colleagues at Kodak, Xerox,            
              Bausch and Lomb, IBM, Mobil Corp. and Fisons Pharmaceuticals.  The             
              students will have an opportunity to benefit from these                        
              professional collaborations through on-site seminars, plant                    
              visitations and possibly even future research internships.  Our                
              ultimate goal is to motivate all participants in the summer                    
              research program to pursue scientific excellence.
