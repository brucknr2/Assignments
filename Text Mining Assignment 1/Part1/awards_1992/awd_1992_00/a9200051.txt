Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to the Department of Sociology at the                
              State University of New York at Stony Brook to establish a Research            
              Experience for Undergraduates SITE.  The program is designed to                
              immerse a small group (8) of undergraduates in an active research              
              environment spanning the areas of mass communication, gender                   
              studies, behavioral sociology, and the sociology of business.  The             
              goal underlying this initiative is to introduce students to on-                
              going research in some of the most interesting and important areas             
              of sociology.  The program is intended to foster interest in,                  
              appreciation for, and skills in basic scientific research,                     
              especially for students who might not otherwise have an opportunity            
              to participate in this type activity.  Students will engage in a               
              intensive eight-week hands-on research experience wherein they will            
              be afforded the opportunity to learn, the phases of the search                 
              process, data gathering manipulation and analyses, theory testing              
              construction, development of historical topologies of sociological             
              phenomena, and relevant statistical and computer applications.                 
              Recruitment effort will center on small and regional colleges with             
              large enrollments of minorities and women.  Those selected to                  
              participate will reflect the recruiting focus.  Support services,              
              informal and structured experiences are planned to encourage                   
              graduate study and/or research-oriented careers.
