Abstract    :
              This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project                
              is in analytical, inorganic, organic, and physical chemistry.                  
              For three summers beginning in 1992, nine undergraduate                        
              students will spend ten weeks engaged in basic research in                     
              chemistry under the direction of various faculty members from                  
              the chemistry department.  The REU activities include unique                   
              features such as a joint effort with the scientific staff at                   
              Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and a concerted effort to                 
              reach out to minority and Appalachian students.  The REU                       
              program will run in conjunction with existing programs that                    
              bring nearly 100 visiting undergraduate science majors and                     
              faculty to the University of Tennessee at Knoxville (UTK).  The                
              large scope of these programs, the extensive resources of UTK                  
              and ORNL, and the considerable previous experience of UTK in                   
              undergraduate training are essential ingredients for the                       
              success of this program.
