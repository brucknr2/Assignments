Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective of this project is to explore disorder introduced in             
              crystalline and mesophase states of linear macromolecules and small            
              molecule model compounds by conformational, large-amplitude motion.            
              Better understanding of this topic will enable us to better manage             
              such important technological processes as the improvement of                   
              materials performance by annealing, large-scale deformation on                 
              drawing and rolling, and the design of new polymeric materials with            
              specific properties.  The central technique used in this project is            
              the thermal analysis for evaluation of the degree of disorder                  
              (entropy).  A special Advanced THermal Analysis System (ATHAS),                
              developed over the years, permits the establishment of the thermal             
              properties of fully ordered solids as a vibration-only reference               
              state, as well as fully disordered solid (glassy) and liquid                   
              reference states.  The deviations from these references states are             
              interpreted in terms of mobile disorder (mesophases) or rigid                  
              disorder (mesophase glasses or rigid amorphous fraction).  On a                
              microscopic level the disorder and motion are then analyzed in                 
              detail by solid state NMR, X-ray diffraction, neutron scattering,              
              optical and atomic force microscopy.  The experimental results are             
              compared to molecular dynamics simulations carried out on                      
              supercomputers.  Typical materials to be analyzed are:  nylons and             
              proteins, stiff-chain polymers, partially and fully fluorinated                
              short-chain and long-chain molecules, tetraalkylammonium salts, and            
              mesophase polymers.
