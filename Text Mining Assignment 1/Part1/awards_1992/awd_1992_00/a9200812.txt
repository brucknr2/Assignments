Abstract    :
                   The Orchidaceae contains perhaps 1500 species or 18% of the               
              Costa Rican flora.  No single reference exists for determining                 
              the orchids of this floristically complex region of Central                    
              America.  The objectives of this proposal are (1) to continue an               
              intensive collecting program of Costa Rican Orchidaceae, and (2)               
              to prepare the first volume of a comprehensive orchid treatment                
              for Flora Costaricensis (Fieldiana, Botany Series).  The                       
              treatments in this volume will be prepared by John Atwood, of                  
              Florida's Selby Botanical Gardens, Dora Emilia Mora of Lankester               
              Gardens in Costa Rica, and Robert L. Dressler of Selby Gardens.                
              Dr. Carlyle A. Luer will prepare a separate volume on the                      
              Pleurothallidinae, and Ing. Eric Hagsater and G. Salazar will be               
              preparing treatments respectively of Epidendrum and Mormodes,                  
              both to be published at a later time.  The first volume will                   
              treat approximately 74 genera and 320 species with alphabetical                
              arrangement except for the genus Epidendrum and genera of the                  
              subtribes Pleurothallidinae and Spiranthinae.  The first volume                
              under this proposal will consist of about 200 pages with double                
              column format.  This proposal is Phase II of a seven-year project              
              culminating in the completion of the Orchidaceae for Flora                     
              Costaricensis, a work expected to consist of approximately 800                 
              printed pages.
