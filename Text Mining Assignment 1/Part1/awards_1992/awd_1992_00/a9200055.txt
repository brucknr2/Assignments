Abstract    :
              9200055  Ritchie    This is a Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site Award
              at  Arizona State University.  The funds provide support for ten  undergraduate
              students selected from candidates from institutions  in the Southwestern United
              States.  Special emphasis is placed upon  recruitment from under-represented
              groups such as females and  minorities, especially Hispanic students. 
              Scholastic achievement  is the primary requirement for participation in the
              program, and  recommendation by a faculty member is a significant factor.  
              Participation consists of summer sessions at Arizona State  University.  The
              research under supervision of faculty members will  involve topics in the areas
              of synchrotron radiation, electron  holography, thin film growth, scanning
              tunnelling microscopy,  nuclear magnetic resonance, Monte Carlo and molecular
              dynamics  simulations, high resolution image simulations, time-resolved 
              scattering, and low energy pion physics.  ***
