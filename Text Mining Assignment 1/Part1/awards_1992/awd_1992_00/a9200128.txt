Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal outlined a multitargeted approach to quantify and                
              find the mechanisms of the previously observed enhancement of                  
              sintering of alumina and other oxide ceramics in high temperature              
              plasmas through an extensive systematic investigation of sintering,            
              defect structures and diffusion under otherwise identical plasma               
              and non-plasma conditions.  A universal sintering model will be                
              exploited for quantitative comparison of plasma and non-plasma                 
              sintering.  This model will be further developed as a more general             
              tool to ultimately assist in prediction of sintering behavior, in              
              or out of plasmas.                                                             
              %%%%                                                                           
              This proposal expects to use the observed defect structure and                 
              their or evolutions during the sintering process as a means to                 
              trace the sintering mechanisms and their kinectics.  Both the                  
              plasma and non-plasma sintering conditions will be used.  Efforts              
              will be made to make both sets of conditions nearly identical with             
              the presence or absence of plasma as the only variable.  Sintering             
              model will be used to compare with the results.  It will enhance               
              the usefulness of the plasma sintering of ceramics.
