Abstract    :
                   Berry College will conduct an interesting research project,               
              attractive for undergraduate students of biology and geology alike.            
              The field of ichnology (the study of trackways and footprints) has             
              enjoyed a dramatic resurgence.  This research on locomotor patterns            
              blends the study of modern and ancient reptilian quadrupeds in an              
              attempt to improve our understanding of trackmaking processes,                 
              including limb kinematics, vertebrate morphology, and the effects              
              of substrate texture and levels of hydration on footprint form and             
              step cycle.  By establishing an empirical database of living forms,            
              it will give added credence to the examination and interpretations             
              of fossil trackways.
