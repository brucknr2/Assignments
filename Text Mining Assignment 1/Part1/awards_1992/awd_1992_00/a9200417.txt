Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to continue a successful Research                    
              Experiences for Undergraduates program at The Whitney Laboratory,              
              a research institute of the University of Florida, located on the              
              Atlantic Coast.  The program provides research training for                    
              undergraduates in cell and neurobiology using marine animals.  Ten             
              faculty members will train students throughout the year in modern,             
              experimental techniques of anatomy, biochemistry, molecular                    
              biology, pharmacology, toxicology and electrophysiology, for which             
              the facility is exceptionally well equipped.  Students are                     
              recruited nationwide and special efforts are made to attract women             
              and minority students.  The students live on the campus of the                 
              Laboratory, have access to all facilities, and become full partners            
              in the ongoing research efforts of their faculty advisors.  Student            
              independence will be encouraged, and they will receive full credit             
              for their work in publications.  In addition to their practical                
              research training, the students' intellectual growth will be                   
              stimulated through participation in the Laboratory's regular                   
              seminar series, a special student seminar series and research                  
              tutorials and discussions provided by each member of the faculty.
