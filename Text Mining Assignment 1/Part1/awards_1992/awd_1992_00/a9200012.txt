Abstract    :
              Concerns about ethical abuses in televised political advertising               
              have grown substantially as a result of developing video                       
              technology.  This demonstration project is designed to explore                 
              the development of criteria and coding instruments for                         
              determining types of ethical abuses in technology for televised                
              political ads.  A panel of experts in communication ethics will                
              develop criteria for identifying types of abuses.  The criteria                
              will be used to develop a coding instrument to be applied to                   
              political spots and a small pilot project on a small sample of                 
              actual spots will be conducted, to determine the usefulness and                
              workability of the coding instrument.  The demonstration will                  
              also develop a script for an educational videotape which would                 
              discuss the problem of political ethics and technology, providing              
              samples of misleading technological applications and suggesting                
              standards of evaluation.  This project marks the beginning of                  
              scholarly work on a topic of major importance on issues of                     
              technology and democracy; results are likely to advance scholarly              
              and public understanding of the effects of media in political                  
              life.  The investigator and the expert panel are highly                        
              qualified; the research plan is good; the budget is very                       
              reasonable; and the proposal is recommended for support with high              
              priority.
