Abstract    :
                   This project will bring eight undergraduate students to                   
              the University of California, Berkeley for an eight week                       
              period in the summer of 1992.  Recruiting for the program is                   
              to be national in scope.  The participants will work with                      
              faculty and graduate students in the Department of Electrical                  
              Engineering and Computer Science.  The students will be in,                    
              or will have completed their junior year, and will all be                      
              women, or members of an underrepresented ethnic minority.  In                  
              addition to working one on one with a faculty member, each                     
              participant will be assigned to a graduate student of the                      
              same gender and ethnicity.  Faculty involved come from analog                  
              integrated circuit design, optical communications,                             
              computational biology, control theory and applications,                        
              graphical user interfaces and CIM, and the Berkeley Sensor                     
              and Actuator Center.
