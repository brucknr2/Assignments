Abstract    :
              The Mechanical Engineering Department of the University of                     
              Minnesota, Institute of Technology has a program of summer research            
              in mechanical engineering for science and engineering                          
              undergraduates.  Fifteen students will take part in the program.               
              Applicants for the program are asked to submit transcripts, letters            
              of recommendation and an essay.  Participants are selected by a                
              panel of faculty members.  The program starts with an orientation              
              program in which research projects and facilities are described.               
              Participants are asked to select a project on which to work from               
              a group of twenty-nine ongoing research projects in mechanical                 
              engineering.  A faculty supervisor monitors the progress of each               
              student and they are given increasing responsibilities as their                
              skills develop.
