Abstract    :
                   In biomes1 ranging from subarctic taiga forests to tropical               
              savannas and woodlands, selective browsing by mammals can alter                
              the composition and diversity of vegetation and, as a result, the              
              rate of nutrient cycling.  The objective of this project is to                 
              gain an understanding of this process, because it is of critical               
              importance to sound ecosystem management.  The interaction                     
              between browsing mammals (specially elephant), vegetation, and                 
              nutrient cycling in the savanna-woodlands of the Zambezi River                 
              Region of Zimbabwe will be studied.  This system was selected                  
              because 1) it is a classic example of the more general                         
              mammal-vegetation-nutrient cycling problem, 2) the interaction                 
              between the African elephant and its habitat is, in its own                    
              right, of major concern to international conservation, 3) the                  
              Zimbabwe Department of Parks and Wildlife is strongly supporting               
              this project, and 4) The United States Agency for International                
              Development (USAID) has funded the nutrient cycling portion of                 
              this study.  Specifically, patterns of browsing in the                         
              Colophospermum mopane woodlands, one of Africa's major vegetation              
              types and a critical habitat will be studied.  Repetitive                      
              browsing by elephant is the major form of natural disturbance                  
              influencing patch dynamics in mopane scrub and woodland, because               
              elephant repeatedly browse some patches of mopane in preference                
              to others with the results that the vegetation of repetitively                 
              browsed patches is degraded.  This proposal will test 3                        
              alternative explanations of the rebrowsing of mopane by elephant               
              1) sodium enrichment of the soil in the vicinity of preferred                  
              patches, 2) nutrient (e.g. nitrogen) enrichment of the soil, or                
              3) proximity of browsed patches to traditional paths of travel to              
              focal resources such as water or mineral licks.
