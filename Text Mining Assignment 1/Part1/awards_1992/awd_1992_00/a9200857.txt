Abstract    :
                     This is a doctoral dissertation study which will investigate            
              the formation and management of interorganizational project teams              
              in high energy physics.  The shift to team science began in high               
              energy physics after World War II.  In the 1950's and 1960's,                  
              experiments were performed by small single-institution group of                
              physicists.  Today groups of 180-200 scientists at several                     
              institutions are common.  The study will examine, among other                  
              things, how a research team selects goal and membership to                     
              maximize the team performance, and what the role of the team                   
              leaders is in creating the optimum fit between goal, team                      
              membership, and the sponsoring organization.  The study will                   
              utilize interviews with high energy physicists about their                     
              participation in a particular experiment, and data from a  database            
              on all high energy physics experiments conducted from  1974 to the             
              present will be used to estimate variance in team  performance.                
                  This study will contribute to a growing literature on                      
              collaboration and the processes facilitating successful                        
              collaboration between scientists.
