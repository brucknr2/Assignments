Abstract    :
              The project is the second phase in                                             
              the development and testing of an                                              
              instrument based on acoustic wave                                              
              propagation to measure, in real-                                               
              time, the depth of scouring around                                             
              bridge foundations.  The                                                       
              measurements gathered allow the use                                            
              of available data processing                                                   
              technology for signal enhancement                                              
              which permits detection of scouring                                            
              over a broad range of signal-to-                                               
              noise conditions.  These conditions                                            
              include measurement during flood                                               
              stages in a river.  The instrument                                             
              is rugged, computer controlled to                                              
              operate unattended, and programmed                                             
              to analyze the data for the                                                    
              detection of unusual scouring and                                              
              alerting a central office of                                                   
              possible hazardous conditions.  The                                            
              benefits from this work is to                                                  
              acquire the capacity for detecting                                             
              in real-time scouring around bridge                                            
              foundations and prevent accidents                                              
              from bridge collapse; and to                                                   
              provide prior notice of dangerous                                              
              conditions to enable timely                                                    
              repairs.
