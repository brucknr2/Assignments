Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The main goal of this proposal is to understand the controls on the            
              fine-scale magnetic structure of ocean crust formed at slow-                   
              spreading ridges.  A high quality data set consisting of SeaBeam               
              bathymetry, sea surface magnetic and gravity data has been acquired            
              over the Mid-Atlantic Ridge from 24 degrees to 30 degrees 30                   
              minutes north.  The principle investigators will investigate and               
              analyze anaoalies in these data to test the hypothesis that the                
              fine-scale magnetic structure is a direct result of volcanism,                 
              tectonism and  alteration processes that form and modify the ocean             
              crust.
