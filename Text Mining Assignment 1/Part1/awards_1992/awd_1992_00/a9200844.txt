Abstract    :
                   A Research Experiences for Undergraduates site supporting                 
              eight students will be funded by this grant.  The focus of the                 
              research will change over the three-year grant duration, with the              
              first group concentrating on (1) planar domains which grow along               
              the gradient of the Green's function, a phenomenon related to                  
              symmetry breaking in needle crystal growth, (2) on local zeta                  
              functions over p-adic fields where (symbolic) computation of                   
              examples is of primary importance and (3) on the topology of real              
              critical points in which one seeks to analyze critical points of               
              perturbations of polynomials with isolated critical points.                    
                   Students will work as teams on projects which combine                     
              extensive computer experimentation with mainstream mathematics or              
              statistics issues.  In addition to weekly student presentations,               
              exchanges with other REU sites will be scheduled.  There will                  
              also be regular visits made to the NSF Regional Geometry                       
              Institute at Amherst College.  Teams will produce final reports                
              and manuscripts for publication where suitable.  All students                  
              will be encouraged to present the results of their work at                     
              professional meetings or at their home institutions.
