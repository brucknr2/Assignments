Abstract    :
                   This project will bring eight undergraduates from                         
              Georgia Tech, and Clark-Atlanta University to work at Georgia                  
              Tech in the Graphics, Visualization and Usability Center of                    
              the College of Computing.  The project will extend over four,                  
              ten week, quarters in each year of operation.  The                             
              participating students will be divided into two subgroups of                   
              four each to address problems and develop techniques in the                    
              area of the graphical representation and display of complex                    
              data sets.  One of the student groups will work in the image                   
              representation and display area, and the other in the data                     
              representation and visualization area.
