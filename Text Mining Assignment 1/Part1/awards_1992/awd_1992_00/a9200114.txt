Abstract    :
              A REU site for the Chemical Engineering Department of the                      
              University of Pittsburgh is planned with considerable interchange              
              between participants, faculty and graduate students both on a                  
              formal and informal basis.  To provide a driving force for                     
              continued contact between students and faculty each student will               
              submit their work for oral presentation at the following spring                
              chemical engineering regional student paper contest.  The goal of              
              this REU program is to provide information, education, enthusiasm              
              and encouragement to a group of the next generation's leaders in               
              science.
