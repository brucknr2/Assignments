Abstract    :
              The project provides opportunities for mechanical engineering                  
              students to participate in research related to real problems                   
              involved in manufacturing systems, control systems, thermal systems            
              and fluid mechanics.  The research projects assume completion of               
              the junior year in a standard mechanical engineering curriculum and            
              build upon the student's education in one or more of the following             
              courses: dynamics, kinematics, controls, fluid mechanics and heat              
              transfer.  Students selected to participate in the program are                 
              offered the opportunity to visit the campus prior to the start of              
              the summer experience.  During the visit, they meet with the PIs               
              and the research advisors.  Matching of the students and advisors              
              is thus accomplished prior to the start of the research experience.
