Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to the Psychology Department of Clark                
              University to continue an REU Site project designed to build upon              
              and make more effective a formal curriculum known as the Research              
              Apprenticeship Program.  It is hoped that this program can become              
              a model for participatory undergraduate science education.  The                
              training model features apprenticeship, hands-on, elbow teaching,              
              where students learn by actively participating in all phases of a              
              research study--ideally from problem formulation to data collection            
              and analysis to presentation at a professional meeting, manuscript             
              preparation and publication.  Students may work with one of 19                 
              Faculty Associates, whose interests collectively address                       
              biological, psychological, and sociocultural aspects of behavior               
              and represent the full spectrum of university-level scholarship in             
              psychology, from neuroanatomy to literary analysis, from work with             
              animals to studies of people in foreign cultures.  Specific                    
              features of the proposed project include (1) funding summer                    
              research, (2) scheduling University Conferences and Summer Seminars            
              to promote collegial scientific discourse with and among students,             
              (3) funding student paper presentations at professional meetings,              
              and community, particularly to women, blacks, and hispanics.  These            
              features support the principal goal of the REU program, to promote             
              careers in scientific research.
