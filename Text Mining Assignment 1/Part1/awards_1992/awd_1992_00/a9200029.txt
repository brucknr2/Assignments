Abstract    :
                   A summer internship program in physics for undergraduates                 
              in the industrial midwest region will be carried out at                        
              Michigan State University.  This is an area of the country                     
              with many colleges and a large number of physics                               
              undergraduates who do not have many opportunities for summer                   
              employment in technical and scientific areas.  This REU                        
              award is directed toward broad-based recruiting in the                         
              region, and toward providing an environment for the selected                   
              students that will encourage them to pursue research careers in                
              physics.  Each student has his own research supervisor, who is                 
              either a professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy or               
              on the staff of the National Superconducting Cyclotron                         
              Laboratory (NSCL).  The students meet regularly to participate in              
              student and faculty seminar series.  The program includes                      
              organized social activities and tours of research facilities.
