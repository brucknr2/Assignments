Abstract    :
              This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project is             
              in the field of chemistry.  For a one-year period beginning April              
              1992, ten (10) undergraduate students will spend ten (10) weeks                
              engaged in basic research under the direction of the faculty                   
              members in the Chemistry Department.  Chemical kinetics has been               
              chosen as a theme to provide a common thread for communication and             
              discussion among students initially, and a common base of knowledge            
              for future discourse among students and faculty.  We expect student            
              participants to work side by side with their mentors, to meet                  
              weekly as a group, to present final written and oral reports to the            
              Department and to participate at a national undergraduate research             
              conference.
