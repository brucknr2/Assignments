              at Kent State University to support eight Junior-class level                   
              participants in a Research Experiences for Undergraduates program.             
              One of these will be a Kent State student, while the remaining                 
              seven will be selected from nominees provided by specified liberal-            
              arts colleges in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia.  Designated            
              faculty members from the Psychology Departments of collaborating               
              institutions have agreed to serve as project coordinators to assist            
              in the initiation, organization, and follow-up of student research             
              activity associated with program operation.                                    
                                                                                             
              Student selection involves nomination by home faculty and a
