Abstract    :
                   The escalating costs of medical care are having a significant             
              impact on the economy of the United State.  An Industry/University             
              Cooperative Research Center on Health Management could research how            
              effective management would better control and minimize costs.                  
                   A planning meeting will study if industry will support an                 
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center on Health                      
              Management to be headquartered at Arizona State University.  While             
              the initial research interests of industry have been found to be               
              focused on "New Ways of Delivering Patient Care", "Physician -                 
              Organization Integration" and "Implementing New Ways of Managing               
              Quality", the meeting will assess industry interest and determine              
              if the  Center has sufficient support and merit to meet the                    
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers Program criteria.             
                   The Principal Investigator and Director as well as the                    
              proposed consortium of researchers from universities across the                
              United States are recognized as eminent researchers and have the               
              resources for this planning meeting.                                           
                   This project has been coordinated with Dr. Lynn Pollnow in the            
              Division of Social and Economic Science at the National Science                
              Foundation.                                                                    
                   The Program Manager recommends Arizona State University be                
              awarded $9,840 for one year for this planning meeting.
