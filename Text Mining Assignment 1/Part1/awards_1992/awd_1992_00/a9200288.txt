Abstract    :
                   This project will bring ten undergraduate students to                     
              work at the GTE Laboratories for a ten week period in the                      
              summer of 1992.  Recruiting for the program is national in                     
              scope, and will build on the past success of similar projects                  
              at the Laboratories.  Each participant will be assigned to a                   
              member of the GTE Laboratories Technical Staff.  A sequence                    
              of oral and written reports will be included in the                            
              experience.  Projects will be involved from the following                      
              organizations within the Laboratories:  Computer and                           
              Intelligent Systems Laboratory, Service Applications and                       
              Technology Laboratory, Systems Technology Laboratory,                          
              Telecommunications Research Laboratory, and Wireless and                       
              Secure Systems Laboratory.
