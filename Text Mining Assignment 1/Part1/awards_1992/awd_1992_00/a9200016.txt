Abstract    :
                   This grant will support the participation of this young                   
              assistant professor, who will work with another group at the                   
              University of Michigan in studying the physics of the particle                 
              responsible for the weak interaction - the Z0.  The machine                    
              called LEP at CERN in Europe which makes Z0's has been running                 
              now for almost three years, and the group at Michigan was                      
              responsible for building an important component of the                         
              spectrometer called L3 which is used in the detection of the                   
              Z0 decay products.  These decays reveal details of the                         
              theoretical "standard model" for the interactions of nature                    
              (including the weak interaction) with great precision.
