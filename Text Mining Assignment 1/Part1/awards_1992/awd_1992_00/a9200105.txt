Abstract    :
              The objective of this proposal is to further investigate the                   
              theoretical and experimental validity of a newly discovered                    
              phenomenon by which the fluid flowing through a polluted,                      
              unsaturated, fine-grained soil can be controlled by a thermal-                 
              electromagnetic process.  If proven correct, this technique can                
              dramatically improve the cost and time involved in electrokinetic              
              methodologies presently used to decontaminate polluted soils.
