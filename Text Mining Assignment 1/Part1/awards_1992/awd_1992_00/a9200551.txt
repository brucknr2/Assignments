Abstract    :
              This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface                 
              Chemistry Program, will apply helium diffraction and reactive                  
              molecular beam scattering techniques to the study of the defect                
              oxide surface.  This combination of structural and reaction                    
              probes will provide detailed information about the relationship                
              between the nature and structure of defects on oxide surfaces                  
              and their reaction properties.  Initial stages of metallization                
              on these model oxide surfaces will also be probed, providing a                 
              clearer understanding of the growth of metal films on                          
              insulating substrates.  The information provided by this work                  
              will add significantly to our understanding of metal-support                   
              interactions in catalysis and electronic device manufacture,                   
              and to the understanding of the reactivity of these complex                    
              oxide surfaces.

              The structure and reactivity of the surfaces of oxides is a                    
              relatively unexplored area of surface science, with major                      
              implications for the understanding of a variety of surface                     
              mediated processes.  This research project will extend the use                 
              of very surface sensitive atomic and molecular beam scattering                 
              probes to the study of the oxide surface.  The information                     
              gained from this work will help to develop the relationship                    
              between structure and reactivity on these technologically                      
              important surfaces.
