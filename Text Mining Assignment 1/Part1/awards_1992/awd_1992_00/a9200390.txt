Abstract    :
              This award will expose undergraduate students, chosen from several             
              central Florida institutions, to one year of research experience               
              in the development and applications of lasers.  Several                        
              internationally recognized faculty in the Center for Research in               
              Electro-Optics and Lasers (CREOL) will act as research supervisors             
              in this project.  CREOL is a world-leading center of excellence in             
              optics, laser development and laser-related sciences.  The primary             
              emphasis of this effort is to encourage more talented undergraduate            
              students from the central Florida region to pursue graduate studies            
              in the field of optics and lasers.
