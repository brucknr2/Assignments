Abstract    :
                   The goal of this project is to develop new saddlepoint                    
              theory and methods, branching into areas not attacked in any                   
              depth to date.  In particular, attention will be directed toward               
              the use of saddlepoint approximations in the analysis of sample                
              survey data, to saddlepoint expansions for resampling problems,                
              and to saddlepoint expansions for a general quadratic form to be               
              used in constructing confidence regions for nonparametric                      
              function estimation.                                                           
                   For many modern statistical techniques employing                          
              sophisticated and often complicated estimators, there is an                    
              important technical difficulty in assessing the accuracy and                   
              precision of statistical estimators. For example, complex surveys              
              yield data which usually require complicated mathematical forms                
              for estimators of the quantities of interest.  Making a clear                  
              statement about the amount of variability inherent in the                      
              estimation process is hindered by the intractability of the exact              
              distributions of these estimators.  Close approximations may                   
              replace these distributions; this work will utilize saddlepoint                
              theory to develop such satisfactory approximate distributions.
