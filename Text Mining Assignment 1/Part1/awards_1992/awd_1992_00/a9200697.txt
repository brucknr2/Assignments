Abstract    :
                   The main objective of this project is to host a symposium                 
              entitled "Topological Field Theories and Quantum Gravity."                     
              The two-day symposium is to be held at the University of                       
              Cincinnati on April 3 and April 4, 1992.  The focus of the                     
              meeting is on a subject which is at the cutting edge of                        
              current theoretical ideas in Quantum Gravity and interacting                   
              relativistic field theory.
