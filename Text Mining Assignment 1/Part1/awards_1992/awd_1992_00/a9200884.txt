Abstract    :
              The research is in two areas:  general purpose parallel                        
              computing, and models of neural computation.                                   
              The first area will investigate the possibility of finding a                   
              standardizing bridging model for parallel computing, at a                      
              level intermediate between the architecture and language                       
              levels.  Such a standard would insulate the development of                     
              software and hardware and thereby speed the success of the                     
              parallel computing industry.  The bulk-synchronous parallel                    
              (BSP) model will be considered as the prime candidate.  The                    
              second area of research will further develop a discrete model                  
              of neural computation that is both weak enough that its                        
              constituents are plausibly simulated by human cortex, yet                      
              strong enough that some basic tasks of learning and memory can                 
              be implemented on it.
