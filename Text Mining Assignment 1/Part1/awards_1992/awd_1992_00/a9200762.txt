Abstract    :
              The research proposed will investigate some important                          
              thermoelastic effects in the solidification of castings. The                   
              quality of a casting depends critically on the thermal boundary                
              conditions at the interface between the casting and the mold.                  
              These are largely governed by the contact resistance there,                    
              which, in turn, depends on the local contact pressure. This                    
              pressure is affected by the thermal distortion of the partially                
              solidified casting, thereby leading to a coupled thermal and                   
              mechanical problem. Experience shows that this coupling can led                
              to an instability which results in profile errors in a nominally               
              plane cast surface. The wavelength of the instability which is                 
              most favored to grow under such conditions. The of more realistic              
              constitutive laws and of thermal deformations of the mold will be              
              studied. A similar investigation will be carried out for                       
              axisymmetric castings in the form of cylinders and spheres.*** //
