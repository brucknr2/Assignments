Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site Award at the            
              University of Kentucky.  The funds provide support for eight                   
              undergraduate students selected from candidates from nine colleges             
              in Kentucky.  Students participate in weekly seminars to discuss               
              progress in their research, receive information of career                      
              opportunities, be exposed to recent advances in the literature in              
              their fields of research.  Undergraduate students will have the                
              opportunity to attend professional conferences in their respective             
              fields throughout the year, and will be encouraged to participate              
              in the annual Regional Undergraduate Chemistry Research Poster                 
              Competition.  Students participate in graduate research supervised             
              by one of seven participating professors on various topics in the              
              general area of membrane science.   Students are selected for                  
              participation on the basis of grade point average, nomination by               
              their home institution, and an essay on interest in the program and            
              career goals.  Emphasis is placed on recruitment from under-                   
              represented groups, for example, minorities, women, and handicapped            
              persons.
