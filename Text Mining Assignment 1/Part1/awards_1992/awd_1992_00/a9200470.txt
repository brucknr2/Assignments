Abstract    :
              This project, funded in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organo-                
              metallic Chemistry Program, provides for continuation of                       
              studies on bimetallic complexes that are encapsulated in a                     
              macrocyclic ligand such that one metal ion is six coordinate                   
              and serves as an electron reservoir and the other metal ion is                 
              four coordinate and can coordinate dioxygen or an oxo ligand.                  
              The ultimate goal is to find systems that can cause four-                      
              electron reduction of dioxygen and to use products of such                     
              reactions to catalytically oxidize organic substrates.  Initial                
              studies have suggested that five and six membered chelate rings                
              formed by complexation of the macrocyclic ligand donors to the                 
              metal ions lead to high strain and prevent the formation of                    
              complexes with the desired stereochemistry.  In this phase of                  
              the investigation new ligand designs that will result in the                   
              formation of seven membered rings will be tested with the                      
              expectation that steric effects will be reduced and the desired                
              product stereochemistry will be realized.  The proposed ligands                
              will also allow for the incorporation of asymmetry and thus                    
              will allow for possible asymmetric oxygenations.

              Whereas many biological oxidants use molecular oxygen                          
              effectively for oxidation of organic molecules scientists have                 
              been much less successful in performing similar reactions in                   
              the laboratory.  Success in this endeavour could be of                         
              significant industrial consequence as molecular oxygen is a                    
              readily available and inexpensive reagent and biological                       
              oxidations are typically highly selective.  Studies such as                    
              those planned by Professor Bosnich are designed to provide the                 
              fundamental information that will ultimately be required to                    
              develop the necessary technology to use molecular oxygen for                   
              selective oxidations on an industrial scale.
