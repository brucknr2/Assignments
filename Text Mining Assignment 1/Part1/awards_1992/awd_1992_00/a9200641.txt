Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will provide supplementary support                                  
              to enable Dr. Israel Broner of the Colorado                                    
              State University to conduct collaborative                                      
              research with Mr. Hirafiji Masayuki for 12                                     
              months at the National Agriculture Research                                    
              Center in Tsukuba, Japan.  Broner and Masayuki                                 
              will apply Masayuki's knowledge of recurrent                                   
              neural networks (RNN) to Broner's prototype of                                 
              a knowledge based expert system (KBES) to                                      
              develop a decision support system (DSS) for                                    
              agricultural applications.                                                     
                                                                                             
              A DSS for crop production will provide                                         
              management advice in a very portable and easily                                
              accessible medium.  The KBES is the memory                                     
              component of the system which uses knowledge                                   
              derived from human experts and research                                        
              results, but is often incomplete and uncertain.                                
              The RNN component, using its feedback                                          
              connections, will be programmed to call on the                                 
              historical information to predict schedules for                                
              different management operations.  Before any                                   
              RNN predictions can be made, basic research on                                 
              induction and fuzzy logic is needed to resolve                                 
              the conflicts between the KBES and RNN.  The                                   
              neural network computations developed by                                       
              Dr. Masayuki will complement Dr. Broner's                                      
              expertise in KBES and will facilitate the                                      
              development of DSS with a long-term benefit of                                 
              aiding the small scale U.S. farmer.
