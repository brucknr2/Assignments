Abstract    :
              The REU program in the Department of Civil Engineering at the                  
              University of Notre Dame supports 10 undergraduate students.  This             
              experience is designed to provide students with an improved                    
              understanding of research and to encourage them to consider careers            
              in research.  The research activities span the areas of expertise              
              of the faculty in civil engineering and include projects in water              
              resources, bioengineering and pollution control, and structural                
              mechanics.  Components of the program include identification of                
              exceptional students through nationwide recruitment with emphasis              
              on women and minority participation; matching of student research              
              interests with faculty; close interaction of graduate students and             
              faculty with the undergraduates to provide students with a fuller              
              appreciation of graduate study, university research, and careers               
              in academia; an intense two month research experience; mini-                   
              courses, as needed, to facilitate effectiveness in the research                
              projects; and a mini-conference for presentation of results.  The              
              goal of the program is to excite some of the best engineering                  
              students in the nation about the challenges of a career in                     
              research.
