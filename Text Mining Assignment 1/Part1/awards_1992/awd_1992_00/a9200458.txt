Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Microbial populations at deep-sea hydrothermal vents link the                  
              transfer of geothermal energy to the production of organic carbon,             
              known as chemosynthesis.  As the particulate organic food source               
              for the filter-feeding and grazing vents animals, free-living                  
              bacteria function as the chemosynthetic base of the food chain for             
              this part of the vent communities.  During the continuation of the             
              RIDGE Initiative, this project will focus on those bacteria from               
              hydrothermal vents.  Dr. Jannasch will address the question - which            
              chemosynthetic bacteria are quantitatively the most important in               
              terms of productivity at hydrothermal vents?  To answer this                   
              question, newly-developed techniques will be used to assess aerobic            
              and anaerobic chemosynthetic bacteria at a large variety of vent               
              environments.  Rates of growth and chemosynthesis will be measured             
              by a variety of in situ and laboratory experiments.  It's assumed              
              that these natural microbial populations are highly responsive to              
              environmental conditions and, therefore, representative of temporal            
              geophysical-geochemical changes of vent systems.  Work at the Mid-             
              Atlantic Ridge vent sites will deal with new approaches for in situ            
              rate measurements of chemosynthetic activity by microbial                      
              populations covering the polymetal sulfide deposits.  In addition,             
              work is also planned for the Guaymas Basin Beggiatoa mats.  These              
              studies will involve the use of two submersibles, the ALVIN and
