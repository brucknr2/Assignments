Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Superfluid helium-3 has been identified as a p-wave pairing system,            
              possessing an isotropic energy gap reminiscent of a superconductor.            
              The theoretical picture remains clouded, however.  It is proposed              
              to measure the pair-breaking energy, using ultrasound at a                     
              temperature well below the phase transition, and from that obtain              
              a value for the energy gap.  The entire pressure range from                    
              saturation vapor pressure to melting pressure will be investigated.            
                                                                                             
              Other experiments are planned on heavy-fermion systems and one-                
              dimensional Heisenberg antiferromagnets.                                       
                                                                                             
              This research aims to clarify some of the puzzles surrounding the              
              quantum-mechanical properties of bulk matter at temperatures close             
              to absolute zero.
