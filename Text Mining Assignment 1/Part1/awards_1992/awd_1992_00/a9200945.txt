Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Two problems of mid-ocean ridge structure and tectonics have been              
              investigated by the PI: the mechanism of sub-ridge mantle                      
              diapirism, and the controls on normal fault evolution at a ridge.              
              He has shown that depletion-related density variations alone are an            
              unlikely cause of mantle diapirism, but that buoyancy resulting                
              from melting and melt percolation through mantle upwelling below a             
              ridge can lead to diapirism. Further work is proposed to look at               
              the role of melt related viscosity in this prosess. The mantle                 
              conditions needed to explain observations of crustal thickness                 
              variations along the EPR, in contract to those along the MAR, will             
              be considered. The results about the mechanisms of normal faulting             
              will be applied to the problem of ridge tectonics.
