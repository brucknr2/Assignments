Abstract    :
                   Accurate modeling and simulation of manufacturing and other               
              complex systems is often hampered by the amount of detail required             
              for a representative modeling effort and the amount of data that               
              needs to be analyzed in order to understand the results of the                 
              simulation.  This situation is further complicated when the system             
              under study is subject to dynamic behavior.  The purpose of this               
              research is to explore the use of abstraction in simulation                    
              environments and to support their use in ways that may allow a                 
              dynamic change in the level of detail of the model.                            
                   This research awards the development and use of an abstraction            
              mechanism with three layers of functionality as a means of modeling            
              and simulating large, complex systems.  Since current simulation               
              models cannot vary the level at which they are aggregated without              
              a significant amount of reprogramming, this approach will provide              
              an innovative way to make the amount of detail intellectually                  
              manageable.   Ultimately, the researcher plans to achieve this goal            
              by creating abstract objects dynamically that hide the unnecessary             
              details of the original objects.  The feasibility of the approach              
              is to be tested with the development of a prototype system.
