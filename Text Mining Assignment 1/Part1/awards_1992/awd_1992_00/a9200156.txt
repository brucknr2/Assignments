Abstract    :
              This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project                
              is in the field of chemistry.  For three summers beginning in                  
              1992, nine undergraduate students will spend ten weeks engaged                 
              in basic research under the direction of the faculty members in                
              the Chemistry Department.  The Department will fund four                       
              additional students, two earmarked for ethnic minorities and                   
              two for community college students.  The central goal of the                   
              program is to expose students to the full spectrum of the                      
              "scientific enterprise."  Accordingly, the program contains                    
              five major components:  (1) research projects; (2) a science                   
              seminar series; (3) communication; (4) career mentoring; and                   
              (5) weekly meetings of students to discuss their research.                     
              Each of these components is designed to address a particular                   
              aspect of the entire scientific enterprise.
