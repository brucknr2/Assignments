Abstract    :
              This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project is             
              in the field of chemistry.  For a one-year period beginning April              
              1992, ten (10) undergraduate students will spend ten (10) weeks                
              engaged in basic research under the direction of the faculty                   
              members in the Chemistry Department.  The goal is to provide ten               
              talented undergraduate students, four from Tufts and six from other            
              colleges, with the opportunity to participate in chemical research.            
              The Tufts program will focus on those students who have maintained             
              their interest in science through the sophomore year, both declared            
              majors, as well as students who are non-majors or undecided as to              
              their specific area of science concentration.
