Abstract    :
              This Minority Research Award Planning activity is directed                     
              toward the use of enzymes to facilitate organic functional                     
              group transformation under extremely mild conditions often                     
              providing products in high yield.  Enzymes have been shown to                  
              be useful reagents in synthetic organic chemistry.  This                       
              project suggests the utilization of enzymes in the synthesis of                
              macrocyclic lactones, porphyrins, and certain classes of                       
              tropane alkaloids.  A major goal of this planning activity is                  
              to identify those enzymes capable of these transformations and                 
              to devise synthetic methodology involving enzymes in the                       
              preparation of these three classes of compounds.  Preliminary                  
              experiments to strengthen the planned research proposal will be                
              conducted utilizing undergraduate students.

              Enzymes are catalysts for many biochemical reactions.  In the                  
              past decade they have shown great promise as laboratory                        
              reagents in the synthesis of new organic compounds with great                  
              specificity and in high yield.  A research proposal will be                    
              prepared concurrently with the activities planned in this                      
              project.
