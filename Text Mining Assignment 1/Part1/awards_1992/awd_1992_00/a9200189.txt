Abstract    :
              This award provides support to continue a successful REU Site at               
              the Demographic Research Laboratory, Western Washington University.            
              Ten undergraduates, recruited nationwide, will participate in                  
              "Applied Demographic Research on Migratioon" for two months in the             
              Summer, 1992.  These students, supervised by a project team of                 
              professional demographers, will focus their research efforts on the            
              study of migration profiles and analytical models.  A variety of               
              data files, including the 1980 Public Use Microdata Sample and the             
              County to County Migration Flow file, 1990 STF's and the Cumulative            
              General Social Survey will serve as primary data sources for the               
              research experiences for undergraduates.  The project provides                 
              undergraduates the opportunity to become involved in the research              
              process and to expand their research-related competencies through              
              an intensive, two-month research project.
