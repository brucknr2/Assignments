Abstract    :
              This research addresses three important topics dealing with the                
              foundations of knowledge bases: view updates, combining knowledge              
              bases, and inconsistent knowledge bases. Algorithms are developed              
              to provide solutions to several problems in this subject. The view             
              update problem is concerned with the appropriate translation of the            
              user's request to update a particular view into an update of the               
              underlying relations. Algorithms that have previously been                     
              developed for stratified disjunctive databases are refined by using            
              specialized data structures and extended to more general types of              
              knowledge bases. Many different but related knowledge bases have               
              been constructed in recent years. Previous research on combining               
              knowledge bases considered primarily the case of definite deductive            
              databases. Those algorithms are extended to more general types of              
              knowledge bases using the stable and well-founded semantics.                   
              Sometimes a knowledge base may become inconsistent. Several                    
              different semantics have previously been proposed to define the                
              meaning of such knowledge bases in order to localize                           
              inconsistencies. Algorithms are produced to compute answers to                 
              queries under these semantics using theorem-proving techniques. The            
              research will be useful for the development of advanced knowledge              
              based systems; it will also enhance the research environment at
