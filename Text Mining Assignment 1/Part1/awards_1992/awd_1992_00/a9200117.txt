Abstract    :
              Eight undergraduate students from the Rocky Mountain and Southwest             
              Regions of the United States will participate in a ten week,                   
              comprehensive research experience at the University of New Mexico              
              during the summer of 1992.  In accordance with his/her interests,              
              each student will participate as a team member in one of the                   
              following four research groups:  1) design, construct and operate              
              a small-scale permeable barrier for groundwater aquifer                        
              remediation; 2) investigate fracture in rock and concrete using                
              laser interferometry and conduct numerical simulations using an                
              interactive graphical method; 3) construct small scale models of               
              hydraulic structures and test these models in an open channel flow             
              facility; and 4) assist in numerical simulations and experimental              
              observations of granular soil under shear using 2D elliptical                  
              disks.  The students will become familiar with their projects                  
              through early contact with the research faculty.  Each student can             
              expect to learn to work independently over the course of the                   
              summer, will present a final seminar on the research, and will                 
              assist in writing a publication describing the work.
