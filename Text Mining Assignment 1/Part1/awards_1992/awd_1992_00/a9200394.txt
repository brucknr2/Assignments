Abstract    :
                   This Research Experiences for Undergraduates award will                   
              support eight students in a research program focusing on                       
              mathematical problems in graph theory.  The highly visual and                  
              intuitive nature of this subject makes it particularly suitable                
              for students just beginning research careers.  There are many                  
              opportunities for algorithmic thinking, computer experimentation               
              and combinatorial applications.  Several graph theorists as well               
              as other colloquium speakers will visit during the research                    
              period as part of the scheduled activities.                                    
                   Research topics include studies of how graph invariants                   
              determine other invariants in product graphs, T-coloring of                    
              graphs, separation numbers of graphs and determination of the                  
              orders of graph subtrees.                                                      
                   Students are expected to have an oral presentation ready at               
              the end of the project.  They will be encouraged to prepare their              
              results for submission to research journals.  The entire group                 
              will attend the Pi Mu Epsilon summer meeting at Miami University.              
                   In addition to the principal investigator, two other faculty              
              and two graduate assistants will act as advisors.
