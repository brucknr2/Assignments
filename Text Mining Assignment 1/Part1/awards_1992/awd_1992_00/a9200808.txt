Abstract    :
                   This grant provides partial support for the purchase of a                 
              reduced instruction set computer system for use by the designers               
              of a major detector for the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider.  The              
              design group is centered at the State University of New York at                
              Stony Brook.  The computer will be used for event simulations and              
              development of codes for event reconstruction and analysis.
