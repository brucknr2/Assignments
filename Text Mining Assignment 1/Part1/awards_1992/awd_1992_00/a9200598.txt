Abstract    :
              This award is made by the Divisions of Chemistry and Materials                 
              Research under the Materials Synthesis and Processing                          
              Initiative. The research will study the synthesis and                          
              characterization of interfaces of metal oxides or activated                    
              organic surfaces with organometallic-derived overlayers.                       
              Methods will be developed for activation of surfaces of                        
              conductors or insulators by introduction of -OH or -NH groups.                 
              The reaction of metal atoms or organometallic complexes with                   
              these surface groups will be studied and contrasted with                       
              solution analogs. It will be possible to create various types                  
              of mixed overlayers in specific and reproducible ways. These                   
              interfacial layers will covalently bond between components of                  
              the composite. Investigations will be performed in parallel on                 
              bulk oxide or nitrogen analog substrates under ambient and                     
              ultra-high vacuum using single crystal supports. The use of                    
              characterizable single crystal materials will enable an                        
              investigation of the precise nature and extent of covalent                     
              interation between the overlayer and the surface of the support.

              Development of methodology for synthesis of surface-bound                      
              species, and application of surface analytical techniques to                   
              analogous bulk and film supports, will augment our                             
              understanding of materials synthesis and interface structure at                
              the microscopic level. Such information forms a basis for                      
              understanding mesoscopic physical and chemical interfacial                     
              properties of increasing importance as electronics components                  
              become smaller
