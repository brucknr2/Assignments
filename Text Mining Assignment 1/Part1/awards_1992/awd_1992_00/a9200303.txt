Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will conduct research on problems              
              of optimal control, both in continuous and discrete time.                      
              Optimality conditions recently obtained for the control of                     
              differential inclusions will be applied to Bolza problems, and                 
              results are to be derived for Hamilton-Jacobi theory and feedback              
              rules.  In addition, a new theory of generalized second-                       
              derivatives will be applied to sensitivity analysis and                        
              parametric methods of optimization.                                            
                   Optimal control problems are useful as mathematical models                
              in many areas of engineering and operations management.  By                    
              better understanding their structure and properties, the gained                
              insight will lead to improved numerical optimization algorithms.
