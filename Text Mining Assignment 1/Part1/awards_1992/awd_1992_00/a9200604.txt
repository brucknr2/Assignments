Abstract    :
              The C. elegans heterochronic gene lin-4, a key regulator of                    
              temporal patterns of cell division and differentiation in diverse              
              cell types of the worm has been cloned and sequenced in our                    
              laboratory.  Certain features of the lin-4 sequence lead us to                 
              propose a somewhat unusual approach to the initial structural                  
              analysis of the lin-4 gene product.  Experiments are designed to               
              test the hypothesis that lin-4 does not encode a protein, but                  
              rather encodes a small regulatory RNA that controls the level of               
              lin-14 protein during development.  Probes from candidate                      
              transcribed regions will be used in Northern blot, nuclease                    
              protection and PCR experiments to identify an RNA product.  The                
              lin-4 gene will be isolated from diverse nematode species and the              
              nucleotide sequences will be compared.  Essential structural                   
              features of a lin-4 RNA product will be deduced from the conserved             
              DNA sequences.  The C. elegans lin-4 gene will be mutagenized in               
              vitro to create frameshift and base substitution mutations designed            
              to test the hypothesis that lin-4 does not encode a protein, and to            
              test key elements of proposed RNA structures.  DNA transformation              
              will be used to test lin-4 genes from other nematode species for               
              the ability to function in C. elegans.  Regulatory and structural              
              sequences required for function in C. elegans will be mapped by                
              systematically constructing and testing in vivo interspecific                  
              recombinant genes.***//
