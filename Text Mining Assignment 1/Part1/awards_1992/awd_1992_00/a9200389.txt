Abstract    :
              Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering at Boston University             
              is committed to providing the education that engineers will need               
              to understand and contribute to technological change in the twenty-            
              first century.  The mission is the training of the country's future            
              engineering leaders and the expansion of the frontiers of modern               
              technology.  This REU expands beyond the "Freshman Research                    
              Opportunity Program" (FROP).  Special attention will be given to               
              recruiting women and minority applicants.  By capturing the                    
              interest of undergraduates in research at an early stage,  the REU             
              program hopes to deflect them into the PhD bound research track,               
              further enhancing the national pool of PhD level scientists and                
              engineers.
