Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor T. Zaslavsky to             
              work in combinatorics.  He intends to investigate surface                      
              embeddability of graphs, biased graphs, matroids satisfying a                  
              linear reduction law and coloring and chromatic polynomials of                 
              linearly representable matroids.                                               
                   The research is in the general area of combinatorics.                     
              Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how                  
              discrete collections of objects can be organized.  And, so it is               
              extremely important to modern communications, for example the                  
              design of large networks as in telephone systems and the design of             
              algorithms in computer science.
