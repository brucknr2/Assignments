Abstract    :
                   This is a three year grant for the renewal of regional                    
              undergraduate participation in ongoing research programs in the                
              Department of Physics, Florida State University.                               
              Applications for ten Summer Junior Fellowship positions are                    
              solicited from 160 colleges and universities throughout the                    
              southeastern region of the United States.  Applicants'                         
              interests are matched with the research programs and extra                     
              attention is given to applications from women and minorities.                  
              The main focus of the program is to provide research                           
              experience for undergraduate physics majors in the southeast                   
              region, with usually 9 out of 10 fellowships going to students                 
              outside of FSU.  The laboratories include a S-FN Tandem Van de                 
              Graaff, a superconducting LINAC, four smaller accelerators                     
              used for environmental and implantation studies, and a                         
              particle physics detector laboratory as well as active                         
              programs at Brookhaven, Fermilab and CERN, an ultra-high                       
              resolution infrared spectrometer, a helium atom scattering                     
              spectrometer, a liquid crystal laboratory, and a number of low                 
              temperature solid state research facilities.  Approximately 15 to              
              20 faculty members will be directly involved with Summer Junior                
              Fellows.  In addition to joint research activities, all Fellows                
              will attend a seminar designed for the program and                             
              will present papers and talks on their summer research near the                
              end of the appointment.  Each summer two or three of the Fellows               
              will work with the host group (nuclear physics), with the seminar              
              series, short courses in computer programming and machine shop                 
              techniques, and the student talks providing the common links                   
              between the different areas of physics.
