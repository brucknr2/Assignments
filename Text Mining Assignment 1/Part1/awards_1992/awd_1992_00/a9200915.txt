Abstract    :
                   This research will cover two major topics, inference                      
              problems when data are corrupted by errors of measurement and                  
              inequalities for martingale type sequences of random variables.                
              The first topic focusses primarily on instrumental variable                    
              estimation in generalized linear and nonlinear measurement error               
              regression models.  Inference methods to be studied include                    
              maximum likelihood, conditional likelihood and quasilikelihood                 
              estimation based on approximate data models.  The second topic                 
              involves comparison methods for tangent sequences of martingale                
              differences.  Special attention will be given to problems                      
              involving domination of martingales by martingales with                        
              conditionally independent increments.  Specific topics to be                   
              investigated include norm inequalities, exponential inequalities               
              and stability properties for martingale type sequences.                        
                   This research is focussed on two different topics.  The                   
              first area involves problems of inference and data analysis when               
              data are not measured precisely.  The second topic is concerned                
              with comparison methods for sums of random variables.  These                   
              methods provide a better understanding of modern probability                   
              theory.
