Abstract    :
              This research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site project                
              is in the areas of chemistry and biochemistry.  For a                          
              three-year period beginning in 1992, ten undergraduate students                
              will spend ten weeks each summer engaged in fundamental,                       
              "hands-on" research, under the direction of faculty members                    
              from the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry.  The                        
              research projects offer a very broad exposure to chemical                      
              research.  A unique feature of the REU site activity is the                    
              departmental commitment to funding of participants to attend a                 
              regional American Chemical Society meeting, regardless of                      
              whether a paper is to be presented.
