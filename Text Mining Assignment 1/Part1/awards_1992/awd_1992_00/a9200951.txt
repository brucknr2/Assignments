Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this proposal is to continue excavations              
              at an important fossil-bearing site in Kenya.  The site, Maboko                
              Island has yielded some very important fossil primates dated to                
              the Middle Miocene, a time period of great anthropological                     
              importance as it frames the divergence of the Old World monkeys                
              and apes.  There has long been debate as to the conditions that                
              allowed the diversification of the higher primates.  Due to the                
              rich fossiliferous beds at Maboko, the investigator should be                  
              able to clarify not only the diversity of middle Miocene mammals,              
              but also the climatic and environmental conditions in which they               
              existed.
