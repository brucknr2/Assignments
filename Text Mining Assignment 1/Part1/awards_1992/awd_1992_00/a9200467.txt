Abstract    :
                   A block travel grant will provide support for 32 U.S.                     
              scientists to attend the International Congress of Entomology in               
              Beijing in summer of 1992.  It has been difficult for scientists               
              from Asia and particularly China to attend international meetings              
              and this Congress represents important opportunities for                       
              communication and scientific exchange.  The quadrennial schedule               
              of Entomology Congresses means that they are milestone events in               
              summarizing the past and formulating the future course of insect               
              sciences.  The program for the congress consists of symposia,                  
              workshops, contributed papers and other activities in 17 sections              
              representing the entire range of entomology and associate                      
              sciences.  Broad participation by U.S. scientists is desirable;                
              unfortunately, costs of travel and other expenses will be                      
              substantial, if not prohibitive, particularly for students and                 
              junior-level scientists.  Application forms for travel grants                  
              will be widely distributed and all U.S. scientists will be                     
              eligible.  A committee has been formed to review applications and              
              make wards.  Half of the awards will be made to students and                   
              preference will be given to junior scientists.  Applications will              
              be ranked based on proposed contributions to the Congress and the              
              degree to which attendance will further the work of the applicant              
              or others.
