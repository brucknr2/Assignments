Abstract    :
                   Professor Goldfeld will work on several problems connected                
              with automorphic forms.  In particular, he will study special                  
              values of the derivative of L-functions and determine if a                     
              cohomology theory of special values of L-functions can be                      
              developed.                                                                     
                   Automorphic forms arose out of Non-Euclidean geometry                     
              in the middle of the nineteenth century.  Both mathematicians                  
              and physicists have thus long realized that many objects of                    
              fundamental importance are non-Euclidean in their basic nature.                
              This field is principally concerned with questions about the                   
              whole numbers, but in its use of geometry and analysis, it                     
              retains connection to its historical roots and thus to problems                
              in areas as diverse as gauge theory in theoretical physics and                 
              coding theory in information theory.
