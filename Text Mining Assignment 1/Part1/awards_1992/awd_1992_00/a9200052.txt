Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to the Department of Political Science at            
              the State University of New York at Stony Brook to establish a                 
              Research Experience for Undergraduates SITE.  Through this program             
              students will engage in research in one of several areas:                      
              political psychology, political economy, or the study of American              
              institution.  Via an intense eight-week immersion in an active                 
              research environment students will become aware of and excited by              
              the nature of modern political science, in terms of the issues,                
              studies and the theoretical approaches and methodologies used to               
              study them.  Students will be exposed to a broad sampling of the               
              research techniques employed in modern political science.                      
              Specifically, experimental techniques emphasized in the study of               
              political psychology as well as the econometric and statistical                
              skills emphasized by faculty who study political economy and                   
              American institutions will be the primary focus of students' work.             
              Recruitment efforts will center on small and regional colleges                 
              without research programs and colleges with large enrollments of               
              minorities and women.  Those selected to participate will reflect              
              the recruiting focus.  Support services, informal and structured               
              experiences are planned to encourage graduate study and/or                     
              research-oriented careers.
