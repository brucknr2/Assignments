Abstract    :
                   Gross will investigate the natural Dirichlet form operator                
              over loop spaces associated to Brownian bridge measure.  The                   
              particular interest is in proving existence and uniqueness of                  
              ground states of the associated Schroedinger operators over                    
              homotopy classes.  This is a continuation of Gross's recent work               
              on logarithmic Sobolev inequalities on loop groups which has many              
              implications for the representation theory of Lie groups.                      
                   The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian                 
              mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in                  
              twentieth century mathematics.  As the mathematical vehicle for                
              exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system, the                            
              representation theory of Lie groups has had a profound impact                  
              upon mathematics itself and theoretical physics, especially                    
              quantum mechanics and elementary particle physics.
