Abstract    :
              Boston University's Manufacturing Engineering Department is                    
              establishing a REU site to provide support for undergraduates to               
              participate in research in the area of modeling, analysis, and                 
              control of engineering systems.  The program emphasizes flexible               
              manufacturing systems, robotics, and process control.  The plan of             
              operation includes: recruitment, selection process, management,                
              support groups, other resources available, and the expected                    
              research projects.
