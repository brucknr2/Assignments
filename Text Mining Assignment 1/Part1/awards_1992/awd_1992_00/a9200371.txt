Abstract    :
                   This project will bring fourteen students to Utah State                   
              University for eight weeks in the summer of 1992.  Recruiting                  
              will be primarily in Utah, with a focus on minorities and                      
              women, and in particular Native Americans.  The students will                  
              develop tools useful for the research projects through a                       
              series of lectures, and then will work on particular research                  
              projects with Utah State faculty members.  The following                       
              research topics will be emphasized:  parallel algorithms,                      
              debugging tools for a parallel environment, optimization                       
              which combine fine grain parallelism with course parallelism,                  
              and neural networks.
