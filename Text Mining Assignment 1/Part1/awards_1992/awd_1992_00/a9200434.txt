Abstract    :
              The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program in the                     
              Chemistry Division is supporting a research project at Emory                   
              University under the supervision of Professor Joel M. Bowman in                
              which he is doing accurate calculations of the vibrational                     
              energies of unusual molecules, including open-shell complexes                  
              such as NeOH and NeCN, electronically excited complexes, and                   
              heavy-light-heavy reactive systems such as IHI and BrHI.  Both                 
              dynamical and spectroscopic information is being obtained.                     
              %%%                                                                            
              A new approach to understanding the forces which bind molecules                
              and control their flexibility is now available through the                     
              computational evaluation of molecular potential energy surfaces                
              and vibrational force fields.  In this project, Prof. Bowman is                
              applying this technique to study a number of simple molecules                  
              with unusual structural and dynamic characteristics.
