Abstract    :
                   These mathematical investigations concern physical behavior               
              of materials and media which is caused by or related to a                      
              microscopic structure.  The questions to be considered include                 
              problems in which the physics is well described by averaging,                  
              such as estimating the overall elastic and electrical properties               
              of composite materials or describing the asymptotic behavior of                
              aerosols; and problems in which averaging does not enter, such as              
              calculating the optical properties of diffraction gratings.                    
              Interestingly, these problems are not only related by their                    
              small-scale structure but also by the fact that similar methods                
              and ideas can be applied to their study.                                       
                   These questions are of theoretical importance in science,                 
              and vital in some engineering and industrial applications.  The                
              Principal Investigator has recently introduced new methods based               
              on function theory to deal with high-contrast composites and                   
              diffraction gratings, and some mathematical constructions related              
              to a new kind of aerosol which arose recently in the photographic              
              industry.  Many improvements and further applications of these                 
              methods  suggest themselves.  The present goal is to extend and                
              improve these methods so that they can be used in more                         
              complicated design and prediction applications than those                      
              permitted by the techniques currently available.
