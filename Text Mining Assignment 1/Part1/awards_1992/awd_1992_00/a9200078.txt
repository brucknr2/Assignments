Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Sputtered coatings of solid lubricating dichalcogenides such as                
              MoS2 , TaS2, and WS2 have received attention for space/high vacuum             
              lubrication applications. Conventionally sputtered films of these              
              compounds have a short lifetime, particularly for sliding contact              
              applications. However, a significant improvement in the adhesion               
              of these compounds to surfaces can be obtained by the bombardment              
              of these films by heavy, high energy ions. The objective of the                
              proposed research is to study the improvement of adhesion of                   
              these films to substrate such as sapphire, silicon nitride,                    
              zirconium oxide. and Mba tool steel resulting from the                         
              bombardment of these films by ME ion beams.
