Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Identity and ethnicity are real dimensions of the social                  
              world, but their content and construction are often misunderstood.             
              Elucidation of the manifestation, if any, and the basis of an                  
              individual's identity with a group can provide understanding of the            
              process by which one becomes aware of one's ethnicity.  This                   
              doctoral dissertation project will investigate the reality of                  
              Appalachian identity among individuals living in Appalachia and                
              individuals living in the urban Midwest but originating from the               
              Appalachian region by means of in-depth interviews beginning with              
              a purposive sample and shifting to a theoretical sample as                     
              information is accrued.  The study hypothesizes that Appalachian               
              identity is based on an individual's awareness of the particular               
              definitions and devaluation of people from the Central Appalachian             
              region by mainstream American society.  This identity is a response            
              to negative stereotypes and may also be a response to feelings of              
              being discriminated against on the basis of regional origin.                   
                                                                                             
                   This project will contribute to the scientific understanding              
              of social relationships and the link between individual and                    
              society.  It also will provide an excellent opportunity for a                  
              promising young scholar to continue to develop independent research            
              skills.
