Abstract    :
                   This project will bring six undergraduates students to                    
              the Hope College Campus for a ten week period in the summer                    
              of 1992.  In this time, the students will be provided with a                   
              research experience, and given the encouragement to pursue a                   
              career in computer science research.  Half the participants                    
              will be from Hope College, and half from other institutions.                   
              A strong emphasis will be placed on the recruitment of women                   
              and minorities.  Areas for research include parallel                           
              algorithms, neural networks, data communication, concurrent                    
              processing, voice recognition, fractal growth and graphics                     
              algorithms.
