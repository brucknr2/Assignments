Abstract    :
              The Electrical Engineering Department at the University of Maine               
              offers ten undergraduate students a grant of $3,000 each plus an               
              appropriate subsistence allowance to participate in their REU Site.            
              The available research projects include: 1) Microwave Acoustic                 
              Solid State Sensors, 2) Robotics, computer Vision and Neural                   
              Processing, 3) Wideband Signal Processing Components for                       
              Communications Applications, 4) Motion Control, 5) Microprocessor              
              Applications, 6) Environmental Noise Measurements, 7) VLSI Based               
              Neuronal Models, 8) Power Systems Applications.  Students selected             
              for the REU program have a high degree of initiative and                       
              independence of thought in both laboratories and course work.                  
              Student research projects are chosen to match the student's                    
              interest and educational level.  At the program culmination a                  
              written report and an oral seminar are required from the student.
