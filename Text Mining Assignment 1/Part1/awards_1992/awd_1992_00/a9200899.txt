Abstract    :
                   This award supports research in matrix theory.  The                       
              principal investigator will work on matrix completion problems;                
              qualitative matrix theory; and problems in matrix and operator                 
              theory.                                                                        
                   A matrix is a rectangular array with possible entries from a              
              wide variety of rings.  This is a field which originated in the                
              nineteenth century as a part of algebra.  It is currently very                 
              active in view of its many applications and connections with                   
              other parts of mathematics and other scientific and technical                  
              disciplines.
