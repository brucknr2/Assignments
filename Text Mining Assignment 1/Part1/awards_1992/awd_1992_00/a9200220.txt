Abstract    :
              The Research Experience for Undergraduates program at Georgia                  
              Institute of Technology is an eight week summer research program               
              designed to attract qualified minority students into the field of              
              electrical engineering.  Ten students of at least junior level                 
              undergraduate standing will be recruited on a nationwide basis and             
              paired with both a faculty and a graduate student mentor to                    
              undertake research projects in the Georgia Tech School of                      
              Electrical Engineering.  The students are housed on campus, and in             
              addition to lodging and a travel allowance, are provided with a                
              $1500/month stipend.  At the conclusion of the summer, the students            
              are expected to prepare both oral and written summaries of their               
              research projects.
