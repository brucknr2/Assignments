Abstract    :
              The University of Minnesota Department of Chemical Engineering and             
              Materials Science has run a successful and thriving undergraduate              
              research program for more than thirty years, and because of                    
              increasing recognition of the need to encourage African American,              
              American Indian, and Chicano/Latino students to pursue graduate                
              studies, this program will fund ten such students.  These ten                  
              students will be selected both from the U of MN and in a national              
              search developed and implemented by the U of MN Institute of                   
              Technology Minority Affairs Director.  The program affords the                 
              students the opportunity to perform guided research in one of the              
              top research departments.
