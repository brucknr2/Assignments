Abstract    :
              This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project is             
              in the field of chemistry.  For a three-year period beginning April            
              1992, ten (10) undergraduate students will spend ten (10) weeks                
              engaged in basic research under the direction of the faculty                   
              members in the Chemistry Department.  Students will be members of              
              active research groups, and participate in research projects                   
              designed to suit their training.  The program includes social                  
              events, tours, and a weekly seminar series featuring visiting                  
              industrial speakers in addition to faculty from the department.                
              The seminars are aimed at the undergraduate audience, and provide              
              an excellent perspective on research careers and opportunities in              
              both industry and academics.  Student participants will be asked to            
              write a journal style research report and speak about their work at            
              regularly scheduled group meetings.
