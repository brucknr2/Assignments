Abstract    :
              This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project                
              is in the fields of chemistry and biochemistry.  For three                     
              summers beginning in 1992, ten undergraduate students will each                
              spend ten weeks engaged in "hands-on" research under the                       
              direction of one of 19 faculty members who will be matched with                
              a student.  The unique aspect of this program is its focus on                  
              the very high concentration of minority students enrolled in                   
              community colleges in Los Angeles and other large metropolitan                 
              areas.  The objective of the program will be to provide a                      
              comprehensive research experience for these minority community                 
              college students, who have little if any prior exposure to                     
              research.  Preference will be given to those minority students                 
              who have already applied for admission to further study in                     
              4-year colleges and universities.  Each student will select                    
              his/her own research advisor, and the nature and scope of the                  
              research project will be arranged to suit the student's level                  
              and interests through consultation between the advisor and                     
              student.  The students will be able to select from areas of                    
              chemistry including biological catalysis, chemical analysis,                   
              chemical physics, chemical transformations, separations,                       
              ecology, electrochemistry, reaction mechanisms and microbial                   
              conversions.
