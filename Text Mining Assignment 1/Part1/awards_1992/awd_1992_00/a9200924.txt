Abstract    :
                The Belgrade rat has a severe microcytic, hypochromic anemia                 
              inherited as an autosomal recessive trait.  Iron uptake into                   
              Belgrade reticulocytes is only about 20% of normal.  The Belgrade              
              rat carries a mutation in an unidentified protein that is involved             
              in iron uptake through the transferrin cycle.  Preliminary evidence            
              suggests the problem may occur in endosomal acidification, with                
              Belgrade vesicles not acidifying to the same extent as normal.  If             
              this is the case, iron uptake through the transferrin receptor                 
              and/or receptor-ligand systems other than the transferrin-                     
              transferrin receptor system may be affected.  Experiments to                   
              explore this are currently underway.  The results of these                     
              experiments may result in the Belgrade rat becoming an important               
              model system for the study of endocytosis and/or endocytic                     
              acidification.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              The world supply of Belgrade rats, which are difficult to maintain             
              in laboratory colonies, is in jeopardy due to a variety of                     
              circumstances.  This proposal requests funds to maintain the                   
              Belgrade rat colony at the State University of New York at Buffalo.
