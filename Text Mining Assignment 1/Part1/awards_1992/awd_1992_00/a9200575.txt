Abstract    :
                   This grant supports the research of Professor Patrick Morton              
              to work on the Galois theory of fields generated by periodic                   
              points of iterated maps.                                                       
                   This research combines techniques from three of the oldest                
              branches of mathematics: number theory, analysis and algebra and               
              further interconnects these seemingly diverse fields.  The most                
              recent and most astonishing applications of this interplay have                
              appeared in theoretical computer science, coding theory and                    
              robotics.
