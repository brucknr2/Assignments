Abstract    :
              The Department of Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering at Iowa              
              State University has implemented a REU program providing                       
              significant research experiences in agricultural and food                      
              engineering.  The objectives are:  1) promote student growth in                
              competence, confidence, and self-esteem by managing a research                 
              project; 2) enhance student written and oral communication skills              
              through research presentations; 3) interest students in research               
              careers and graduate study by having them join working research                
              groups in agricultural or food engineering.  After selecting a                 
              topic area, each participant will join a research group and be                 
              assisted by faculty in defining a research problem.  The student               
              will define the problem in a proposal, carry out a project, and                
              present results orally and in a written report.  The student will              
              refine the report and enter it in one or more undergraduate student            
              paper competitions.  Suitable papers will be published in refereed             
              journals.
