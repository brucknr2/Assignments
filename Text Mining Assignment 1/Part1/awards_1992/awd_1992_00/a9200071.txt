Abstract    :
                   This award is to support a Research Experience for                        
              Undergraduate Site.  The participants will be students from                    
              the Chicago area and will be participating in research                         
              projects at the Illinois Institute of Technology.                              
                                                                                             
              The research projects cover a spectrum of computer science                     
              activities including software fault detection, program                         
              testability, expert systems, data base research, machine                       
              reasoning, image synthesis, computer aided instruction, and                    
              message driven computing.
