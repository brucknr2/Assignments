Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The thermodynamics and kinetics of metastable alloy formation are              
              investigated in alloys formed by mechanical alloying, ion                      
              irradiation, and vapor deposition.  Enthalpy and free energy                   
              calculations are performed that account for excess specific heat of            
              an undercooled liquid.  Effects of stress and structural relaxation            
              on phase equilibria and reaction kinetics in thin film diffusion               
              couples are studied by X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, and             
              Rutherford backscattering spectrometry.  Electron irradiation of               
              amorphous alloys in metastable equilibrium with terminal solution              
              precipitates is employed to examine diffusion mechanisms in                    
              amorphous alloys and the effects of point defect supersaturation on            
              phase equilibria.

              This research is expected to advance our understanding of both the             
              thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of metastable alloy phase                    
              formation.  These unusual materials can be made in large quantities            
              and have commercial possibilities.
