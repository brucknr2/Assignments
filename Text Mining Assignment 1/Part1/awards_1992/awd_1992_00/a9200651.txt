Abstract    :
              This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project                
              is in the field of chemistry.  Eight undergraduate students                    
              will spend ten weeks during the summer engaged in basic                        
              research under the direction of the faculty members in the                     
              Chemistry Department.  Students will be recruited from                         
              historically Black campuses in Mississippi.  Each of four                      
              faculty mentors will work with two undergraduates, addressing                  
              water quality research from the standpoint of their                            
              specialities (Analytical, Inorganic, Physical, and                             
              Biochemistry).  A seminar will bring all faculty and students                  
              together on a daily basis, building strong student-student and                 
              student-faculty relationships.  Participants will also work                    
              with a wide variety of chemistry instrumentation not otherwise                 
              available to them.  Related research skills for the chemist                    
              will be developed, including software applications, statistics,                
              and on-line bibliographical retrieval.
