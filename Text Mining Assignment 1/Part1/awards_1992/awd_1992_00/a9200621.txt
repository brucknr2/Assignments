Abstract    :
                   Polarized noble gas samples of 3He, 21Ne and 129Xe provide                
              tools for our multifaceted program investigating fundamental                   
              interactions at the atomic, nuclear and nucleon scale.  We                     
              have advanced from the exploratory stage of four years ago,                    
              when large quantities of 3He were first polarized by spin                      
              exchange with laser optically pumped Rb, to the successful                     
              development of high precession NMR frequency spectroscopy and                  
              the realization of polarized 3He targets.  With the techniques                 
              developed, we are able to measure free precession frequencies                  
              with a precision of 10-7 Hz in a one hour measurement interval                 
              and have set new limits on Lorentz Invariance violation due to                 
              Mass Anisotropy with respect to a preferred direction.  A                      
              measurement of the time reversal invariance violating electric                 
              dipole moment (EDM) of Xe129 is underway.  This measurement                    
              should be sensitive to the EDM at a level of 10-27 e-cm.  Our                  
              study of the optical pumping and spin exchange mechanisms,                     
              theory and measurement of depolarization including ionization                  
              by the accelerator beam, the development of diode laser arrays                 
              and exploration of new light sources have made possible the                    
              practical application of polarized 3He as a target for neutron                 
              polarization and accelerator experiments.  We are now in the                   
              process of building an experiment at the MIT Bates LINAC to                    
              measure the electric form factor of the neutron by quasi-                      
              elastic scattering of polarized electrons from polarized 3He.                  
              We will also demonstrate the feasibility of a scaled up target                 
              for a measurement of the neutron's spin dependent structure                    
              function by deep inelastic scattering of polarized electrons                   
              from polarized 3He at SLAC with the intent of undertaking that                 
              measurement as soon as possible.
