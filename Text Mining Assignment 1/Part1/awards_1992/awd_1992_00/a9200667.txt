Abstract    :
                   In conjunction with Dr. Knupp of the University of Alabama,               
              the Principal Investigator will conduct an observational and                   
              numerical modeling study of deep convective storms.  Specific                  
              objectives include:                                                            
                   Investigate the effects of condensate loading/unloading and               
              phase change on updraft/downdraft vertical acceleration.                       
                   Using advanced radar techniques, determine the mix of various             
              hydrometeor species within deep convection.                                    
                   Develop and apply a radar scan simulation model which will be             
              used to evaluate the accuracy of wind and hydrometeor fields                   
              derived from the respective multiple Doppler and multi-parameter               
              radar analyses.                                                                
                   If successful, this research will help clarify the                        
              relationships and interactions between the thermodynamics and                  
              microphysics of deep convective storms.
