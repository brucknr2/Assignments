Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to the Graduate School at Baylor College             
              of Medicine (BCM) to establish a Research Experiences for                      
              Undergraduates SITE.  Ten college undergraduates selected from a               
              nationwide pool of hundreds of applicants will be exposed to a                 
              research atmosphere through their participation in a 10 week summer            
              career development program.  Participants will be selected by a                
              committee composed of faculty from each basic science department.              
              Students will be matched with volunteer faculty mentors and become             
              functioning members of their laboratories.  The unifying focus of              
              the REU Site will be cellular signal transduction.  BCM has an                 
              outstanding reputation in this area of fundamental biological                  
              research involving a number of basic science departments including             
              Biochemistry, Cell Biology, Molecular Physiology and Biophysics,               
              and Neuroscience.  The projects that will be offered will involve              
              subjects and techniques that will be appropriate for students with             
              a diversity of interests, backgrounds, and levels of experience.               
              The faculty of BCM have already gained experience in designing                 
              undergraduate research projects and interacting with college                   
              students through participation in a 3 year pilot program.  The                 
              laboratory oriented aspect of the program will be supplemented by              
              students' participation in research discussions, seminars, career              
              development activities and social/cultural activities sponsored                
              through the SMART Program by the Graduate School.  NSF sponsored               
              participants will have the benefit of interacting with other                   
              undergraduates form throughout the nation who will be supported by             
              other sources and of entering an established career development                
              program that effectively promotes interest in science and prepares             
              undergraduates to enter research oriented careers.
