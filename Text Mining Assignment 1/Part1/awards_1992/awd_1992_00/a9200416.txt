Abstract    :
              Research in Particulate Systems Engineering is crucial to advances             
              in combustion, atmospheric and environmental sciences, nuclear                 
              winter studies, nuclear reactor safety, and materials                          
              manufacturing.  The purpose of this project is to provide research             
              experiences for twelve undergraduate students in this area at the              
              University of Missouri-Columbia.  Each student will undertake a                
              specific research project, and faculty advisors will work with the             
              students to develop his/her research skills.  An essential element             
              of the program is its emphasis on professional development of the              
              students.  The purpose is to infuse bright, undergraduate students             
              with an enthusiasm towards research careers, including graduate                
              level education.
