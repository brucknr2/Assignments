Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site Award at                
              North Carolina State University.  The funds provide support for                
              seventeen undergraduate students selected from candidates from                 
              sixty five potential institutions in the Southeastern United                   
              States.  Participation consists of a summer session at North                   
              Carolina State University.  Special emphasis is placed upon                    
              recruitment from under-represented groups such as females and                  
              minorities.  Scholastic achievement is the primary requirement for             
              participation in the program, and recommendation by a faculty                  
              member is a significant factor.   The research under supervision of            
              faculty members will involve topics in the areas of super-                     
              resolution optical spectroscopy, compound semiconductors, atomic               
              collisions, x-ray absorption spectroscopy, supernova remnants, and             
              condensed matter theory.  The professors involved in this program              
              have a strong record of interaction with undergraduate students in             
              research.  The program has had considerable success in the past                
              four years, for example, more than 24 publications with                        
              undergraduate student co-authors, several regional awards for                  
              student papers, and one winner of the Apker Award by the American              
              Institute of Physics for the outstanding undergraduate research                
              project in the nation, plus an additional Apker finalist in 1991.
