Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project involves the dissertation research of an                          
              anthropology student in a tribal area of Thailand.  The student                
              will examine how local tribal peoples have changed their social                
              organization in response to government activities in the region.               
              He hypothesizes that the recent increase in local-community                    
              social hierarchies is related to access to government programs                 
              which provide access to income.  His method will be to focus on                
              three villages selected to vary along the dimension of local-                  
              state interactions.  Using participant observation and structured              
              interviews, he will study how people think of their relationships              
              with the state institutions they are aware of.  He will conduct                
              weekly economic surveys in these villages as well as a wider                   
              socio-economic survey of an additional 8 villages.                             
                                                                                             
              This research is important because tribal peoples everywhere are               
              in intimate contact with state (and international) programs.                   
              Understanding how one regional case has evolved can help decision              
              makers understand how to influence people in similar areas to                  
              change their behavior to stimulate beneficial economic                         
              development.
