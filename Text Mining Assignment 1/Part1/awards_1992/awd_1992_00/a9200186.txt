Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the                       
              Chemistry Division, Professor Yuan Lee of the University of                    
              California, Berkeley, will chair the XIV International                         
              Symposium on Molecular Beams in Pacific Grove, California in                   
              June, 1992.  This conference will bring together both                          
              established and younger scientists and students from around the                
              world who are working on the forefront of molecular beam                       
              research.  In the conference sessions the contribution of                      
              molecular beams to a broad range of basic and practical                        
              applications will be emphasized, focussing on areas such as                    
              collision dynamics, beam-photon and beam-surface interactions,                 
              atomic and molecular clusters, applications, and molecular beam                
              techniques.  Each of the eight sessions will have four to six                  
              speakers, with the balance of the time being devoted to                        
              contributed oral presentations.  There will be a ninth, poster                 
              session.                                                                       
              %%%                                                                            
              The main purposes of this symposium are to enhance the                         
              contribution of molecular beams to a broad range of                            
              interdisciplinary chemical and physical phenomena as well as                   
              their practical and other applications; to expose a larger                     
              fraction of the North American molecular beams community to the                
              ideas and thinking of the European community; and to expose                    
              young North American scientists and students to the latest                     
              developments in the subject as well as to the world-class                      
              research scientists attending symposium.
