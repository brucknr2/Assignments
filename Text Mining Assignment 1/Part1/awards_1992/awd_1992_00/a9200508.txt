Abstract    :
              The Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department at Syracuse                
              University has served as a REU site for the past three years and               
              will continue this year.  The research stipends will be awarded to             
              motivated and academically superior engineering undergraduates who             
              have completed their junior year studies. The project has both the             
              summer and academic year components.  Seven faculty members in the             
              Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department have expressed                 
              active interest in supervising the research efforts of the                     
              students.  The areas in which these faculty members are currently              
              engaged in research span experimental and computational fluid                  
              mechanics, gasdynamics, aerodynamics, heat transfer, aeroacoustics,            
              noise control and composite materials.  A REU participant may                  
              select a research problem in any one of these research areas of                
              interest to him or her.  Research participant's choice of a                    
              research problem and faculty supervisor's field of specialization              
              will be matched.
