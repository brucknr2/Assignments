Abstract    :
              In this project, supported jointly by the Analytical and                       
              Surface Chemistry Program and the Atmospheric Chemistry                        
              Program, Professor Roberts will study the interaction of small                 
              molecules with well-characterized ice surfaces.  These ice                     
              surfaces will be made by epitaxial growth on platinum single                   
              crystal substrates, and characterized by reflection infrared                   
              and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.  The sticking                            
              probability, adsorbed structure, and surface reactivity of a                   
              number of small molecules relevant to stratospheric ozone                      
              chemistry will be examined.  Molecules such as hydrochloric                    
              acid, hypochlorous acid, and nitric acid will be studied, with                 
              a view toward understanding the effects of ice structure,                      
              adsorption kinetics, and surface reactions on the production of                
              species important in stratospheric ozone depletion.                            
              %%%                                                                            
              Reactions occurring on stratospheric ice particles are thought                 
              to dominate the chemistry which results in the destruction of                  
              ozone in the upper atmosphere.  Very little is known about the                 
              basic chemistry of the ice surface, and the reactions of                       
              relevant small molecules on this surface.  This research                       
              project will address questions of adsorption and reaction of                   
              these small molecules, primarily chlorine source molecules, on                 
              well-characterized ice surfaces.  Basic information of this                    
              type is essential to a complete understanding and eventual                     
              remediation of the depletion of ozone in the upper atmosphere.
