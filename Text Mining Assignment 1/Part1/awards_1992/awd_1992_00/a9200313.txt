Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will study the relationship                    
              between the Laplacian of a compact manifold and the geometry of                
              the manifold. He will attempt to determine the extent to which                 
              the spectrum of the manifold determines the class up to finitely               
              many topological types. The principal investigator will also                   
              study the relationship between spectrum and other geometric                    
              quantities such as diameter and injectivity radius.                            
                   This award will support research in the general area of                   
              differential geometry and global analysis. Differential geometry               
              is the study of the relationship between the geometry of a space               
              and analytic concepts defined on the space. Global analysis is                 
              the study of the overall geometric and topological properties of               
              a space by piecing together local information. Applications of                 
              these areas of mathematics in other sciences include the                       
              structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas boundaries, and                 
              the large scale structure of the universe.
