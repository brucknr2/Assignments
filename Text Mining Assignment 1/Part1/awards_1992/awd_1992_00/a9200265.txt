Abstract    :
                   This project treats time-discrete one- and two-dimensional                
              sequences and arrays with good correlation properties.  Such                   
              sequences find applications in signal processing and as aperture               
              functions for electromagnetic and acoustic imaging.  Applications              
              of two dimensional perfect binary arrays are found in 2-D                      
              synchronization and time-frequency coding.  Higher dimensional                 
              arrays are used in channel coding and in cryptographic coding.                 
              This work has three topics under study: perfect binary arrays,                 
              dot-matrix patterns with certain correlation requirements, and                 
              periodic complementary sequences.  These problems are studied via              
              their respective algebraic formulations viz. difference sets,                  
              relative (divisible) difference sets and difference families.                  
              Various algebraic, number theoretic and geometric ideas have been              
              used recently with some success in constructing these arrays and               
              some generalizations.
