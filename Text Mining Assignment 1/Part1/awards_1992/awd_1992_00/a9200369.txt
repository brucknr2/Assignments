Abstract    :
                   This is a collaborative project of the University of                      
              Central Florida and the University of South Florida.  Ten                      
              undergraduate students will be involved in the program which                   
              will span the calendar year.  The students will select from                    
              several possible projects to provide a more active                             
              involvement in the program.  They will follow a course of                      
              general immersion within the research environment including                    
              regular meetings, and plans for professional presentations.                    
              Examples of the kinds of projects with which the participants                  
              will work, are the following:  segmentation of optical flow                    
              field, modeling human walking for computer vision system,                      
              pose estimation using motion trajectories, function-based                      
              modeling of articulated objects, range image analysis, and                     
              parallel algorithms in computer vision.
