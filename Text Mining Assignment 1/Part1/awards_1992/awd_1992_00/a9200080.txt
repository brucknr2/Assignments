Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will help the Department of Chemistry at the University of                     
              Chicago renovate the beamline X19C at the National Synchrotron                 
              Light Source, which will be used in research investigations in                 
              the following areas of chemistry:  1)  determination of the                    
              structure of surfaces of complex fluids composed of polymers,                  
              lipids, lyotropic and thermotropic liquid crystals, 2)  the                    
              structure of the liquid metal-vapor and liquid metal-liquid                    
              dielectric interfaces, and 3)  the structure of monolayers of                  
              amphiphiles at the liquid-vapor and liquid-liquid interface.                   
                                                                                             
              Surface sensitive x-ray scattering techniques are used to study                
              phenomena occuring at liquid interfaces.  These techniques                     
              require that the x-ray source have high brilliance, i.e.,                      
              typically a synchrotron source must be used.  A high-brillance                 
              source is needed because the number of scattering molecules at                 
              the interface is very small, the intrinsic scattering power of                 
              the organic compound of interest is very low, and the beam size                
              required for grazing incidence Bragg diffraction is very small.                
              The areas of potential technological application of the                        
              techniques which will be enabled by the instrumentation which                  
              will be provided are polymer surfaces and interfaces for                       
              improved lubrication and adhesion, cohesion of composite                       
              materials, synthetic thin films, coatings, and electrodes.
