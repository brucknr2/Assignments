Abstract    :
              Ramachandran         The main thrust of the research is to study the inter- 
              relationship between parallel algorithms and architectures.  The  objective is
              to understand the impediments to the efficient  implementation of parallel
              algorithms on realistic parallel  architectures.  This research involves
              studying the impact of  architectural issues such as latency, network
              contention,  granularity, synchronization, and communication on the 
              performance of parallel algorithms.  The approach to be taken is  to identify
              frequently occurring parallel kernels in large-scale  scientific/engineering
              applications; experiment with these  kernels on target architectures of both
              SIMD and MIMD varieties;  and augment the experimental work with simulation
              studies to  extrapolate the results for future parallel architectures.  The 
              effects of input/output features on the performance of such  parallel kernels
              are also being studied.
