Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is a feasibility investigation as outlined by                     
              the Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) program.                      
              The purpose of the project is to investigate new concepts for                  
              masonry units and systems with consideration given to                          
              structural behavior, field constuctibility, durability,                        
              thermal performance, and all other performance attributes                      
              which contribute to the sufficiency, reliability, and economy                  
              of masonry structures.
