Abstract    :
                   The PI has organized the XXth Informal Conference on                      
              Photochemistry scheduled to be held in Atlanta during the period 26            
              April - 1 May, 1992.  The conference will address the following                
              topics:  atmospheric photochemistry, free radical kinetics, free               
              radical spectroscopy, optical diagnostic techniques, photochemistry            
              on surfaces, photophysics and energy transfer, reaction dynamics,              
              and photodissociation dynamics.   The PI has requested funding from            
              NSF to cover the cost of travel and conference fees for junior                 
              scientists (postdoctoral and graduate students) only.  (The PI will            
              seek funds for travel support for invited speakers and other                   
              attendees from other government agencies.)
