Abstract    :
              The goal of this project in Structural and Geotechnical Engineering            
              at the University of Maine is to encourage more outstanding                    
              undergraduates to pursue research careers.  The key aspects                    
              include:  1) a successful recruitment program; 2) careful matching             
              of student interests with available research projects; 3) an                   
              effective management structure; 4) research assignments the                    
              students can quickly grasp and complete in the time frame; and 5)              
              follow-up procedures designed to maintain student interest in                  
              research.  The four research projects involve finite element                   
              analysis, state-of-the-art soils testing, scale modeling,                      
              structural testing, and soil-structure interaction.  Two students              
              will be involved in each project to allow for student interaction.             
              Interaction will also be fostered by group seminars and meetings.              
              Extended funding for this site allows the school to continue its               
              long standing commitment to undergraduate research.
