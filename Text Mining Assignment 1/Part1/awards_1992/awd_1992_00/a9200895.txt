Abstract    :
                   Caddisflies are one of the dominant, beneficial orders of                 
              insects in most Nearctic stream and lake ecosystems.  They                     
              constitute a major component in the diet of fishes, and are                    
              therefore important to sport and commercial fisheries management.              
              Caddisflies are also important pollution indicator organisms,                  
              because most species are intolerant of adverse water quality.                  
              Insects and other invertebrates account for an estimated 90% of                
              the earth's animal biomass and 95% of all animal species.  They                
              undergird the world's biological systems, and are critical to                  
              maintenance of those systems.                                                  
                   This study will survey and document for the first time the                
              biodiversity of this important group of insects in the Interior                
              Highlands.  This mountainous region is an important                            
              biogeographical link between the Appalachian and Rocky Mountain                
              chains.  The research will provide the first major treatment of                
              caddisfly biodiversity for any major mountain region of North                  
              America, and will correlate caddisfly species with geological,                 
              physiographic, hydrological and vegetational characteristics of                
              the region.  Correlations of species with environmental                        
              parameters will be made, using Geographic Information System                   
              (GIS) computer program.  The study will greatly enhance our                    
              knowledge of caddisflies in the region and allow aquatic                       
              ecologists and fisheries scientists to make predictive inference               
              as to which Trichoptera species can be expected in certain types               
              of aquatic systems.
