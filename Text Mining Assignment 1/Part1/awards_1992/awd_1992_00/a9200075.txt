Abstract    :
              This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project                
              is in the field of chemistry.  Beginning in 1992, twelve                       
              undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer engaged                
              in basic research under the direction of the faculty members in                
              the Chemistry Department.  The focus of the REU project is to                  
              stimulate an increase in the number of students pursuing                       
              research-oriented careers in science, by reaching out to new                   
              populations of students, both outside and inside the                           
              University, to provide the benefits of undergraduate research                  
              experience, to inform students of the potential that chemistry                 
              holds as a career, and to aid in their realization of full                     
              scientific potential.  The program includes ten weeks of                       
              research, academic credit, a seminar series, housing, travel                   
              funds and social activities.  The research projects of the                     
              fourteen participating faculty span a wide range that includes                 
              organic and inorganic synthesis, kinetic and mechanistic                       
              studies, computational chemistry, analytical instrument design,                
              environmental analytical chemistry, crystallization methods,                   
              solid-state chemistry, and electrochemistry.
