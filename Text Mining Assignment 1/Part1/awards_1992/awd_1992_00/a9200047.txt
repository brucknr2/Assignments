Abstract    :
              The purpose of this Research Experience for Undergraduates program             
              at the University of Southern California is to provide research                
              experiences for underrepresented groups within the                             
              interdisciplinary laser and photonics research facility of the                 
              Center for Laser Studies.  This Center has a distinguished record,             
              not only for world-renowned research, but also for nurturing the               
              careers of women and underrepresented ethnic groups.  All the                  
              undergraduates contribute substantially to the research at the                 
              Center for Laser Studies, working on nonlinear optics, fiber optic             
              systems, solid-state lasers, laser processing, and quantum optics.
