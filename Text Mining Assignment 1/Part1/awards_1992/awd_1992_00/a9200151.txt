Abstract    :
              This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project is             
              in the field of chemistry.  For a three-year period beginning April            
              1992, eight (8) undergraduate students will spend ten (10) weeks               
              engaged in basic research.  Each participant will work with an                 
              individual faculty member who has an active research program in an             
              area of interest to the student.  Participants may choose from at              
              least eighteen projects in analytical, biological, inorganic,                  
              organic, and physical chemistry.  Participants will learn by work              
              on their own project, and by observation of other members of their             
              research group, how to attack a research problem from design                   
              through execution and interpretation of experiments.  Projects are             
              designed to give the undergraduate scholar maximum flexibility in              
              their experimental approach and will allow an individual to work as            
              independently as he/she is capable of.  Regular research                       
              conferences and oral presentations (two during the ten weeks) will             
              serve to acquaint every participant with the nature of all of the              
              other projects and provide a basis for individual discussions                  
              throughout the summer.
