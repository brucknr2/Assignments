Abstract    :
              Materials growth and fabrication                                               
              techniques now allow, for example,                                             
              the introduction of barriers, wells                                            
              dopants and strain in a controlled                                             
              fashion and allow the growth of all-                                           
              binary ordered materials (as an                                                
              alternative to ternary alloys).                                                
              Moreover, ultrafast laser techniques                                           
              have been developed that now allow                                             
              the measurement of charge transport                                            
              over micron and nanometer dimensions                                           
              with picosecond and femtosecond                                                
              temporal resolution.  The objective                                            
              of this proposal, simply stated, is                                            
              to take advantage of these advances                                            
              in materials growth and in ultrafast                                           
              laser spectroscopy to study,                                                   
              measure, optimize and control charge                                           
              transport and space-charge field                                               
              formation in semiconductor                                                     
              structures over nanometer spatial                                              
              dimensions. The intent is not only                                             
              to improve the transport, but                                                  
              simultaneously to enhance the                                                  
              magnitudes and speeds of the optical                                           
              nonlinearities that result from such                                           
              transport.                                                                     
              Future advances in the development                                             
              of photonic and electronic systems,                                            
              and interconnects between the two,                                             
              may well rely on, and be limited by,                                           
              the ability to measure and control                                             
              charge formation, screening and                                                
              changes in optical properties that                                             
              accompany such transport. Carrier                                              
              transport over these dimensions will                                           
              occur on sub-picosecond time scales                                            
              and may even be ballistic. Moreover,                                           
              even modest voltages applied across                                            
              such small dimensions will produce                                             
              huge fields and may result in hot                                              
              carriers.  While much is known about                                           
              the relaxation of nonequilibrium                                               
              carriers in energy within the bands,                                           
              little is known about transport                                                
              under these conditions of the

              nonlinear optical response.                                                    
              Since the idea is to engineer the                                              
              structure to improve the transport                                             
              and to enhance the optical

              transport, these studies will
