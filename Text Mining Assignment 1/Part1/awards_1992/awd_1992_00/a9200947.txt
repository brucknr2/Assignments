Abstract    :
                   Key experiments are proposed for the advancement of quantum               
              dynamics, the study of time evolution in systems described by                  
              quantum rather than classical mechanics.  Both few and many body               
              systems will be examined in real time.  These include microwave                
              driven highly excited hydrogen atoms, a search for a quantum                   
              breaktime in the evolution of a microwave driven ensemble of                   
              strontium atoms and an investigation into the gas-plasma phase                 
              transition in an overdense gas of Rydberg calcium atoms.  These                
              experiments will enhance our understanding of the relationship                 
              between the quantum theory of small systems and the nonlinear                  
              dynamics of classically macroscopic systems.
