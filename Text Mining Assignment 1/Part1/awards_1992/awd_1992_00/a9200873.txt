Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will conduct research in three                 
              related areas of dynamical systems. The first area concerns the                
              minimal interval exchange with two or more discontinuities and                 
              asks whether it is prime. The second area of research involves                 
              the Teichmuller geodesic flow and the third area concerns the                  
              moduli space of flat Riemannian surfaces with fixed cone                       
              singularities.                                                                 
                   This award will support research in the general area of                   
              dynamical systems. A process which is very simple and easy to                  
              understand locally can become extremely complicated, nonlinear,                
              and difficult to analyze globally. Dynamical systems is the study              
              of this local to global relationship. Many physical systems can                
              best be modeled using this area of mathematics including fluid                 
              flow and turbulence, complex biological systems, mechanical                    
              systems, and chemical reactions.
