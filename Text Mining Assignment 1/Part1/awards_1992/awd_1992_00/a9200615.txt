Abstract    :
                   This Research Experiences for Undergraduates site award will              
              support eight undergraduate researchers working under the                      
              supervision of the site director and two faculty associates, one               
              from Spelman College.  Students will be engaged in mathematical                
              research focusing on questions regarding the solution of linear                
              algebraic equations and linear programming type optimization                   
              problems.  Students will examine various iterative schemes for                 
              solving matrix systems with real, symmetric positive definite                  
              matrices.  A primary target in the research is the estimation of               
              extreme eigenvalues of real symmetric matrices.  Computer                      
              experiments will be run to assist in the formulation and testing               
              of hypotheses.  Students will be encouraged to continue their                  
              projects during the academic year.                                             
                   This project continues a similar one funded during the past               
              year.
