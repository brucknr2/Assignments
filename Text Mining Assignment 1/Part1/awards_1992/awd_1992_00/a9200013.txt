Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will help the Department of Chemistry at the University of                     
              California at Los Angeles acquire a 360 MHz NMR spectrometer                   
              which will be used in research investigations in the following                 
              areas of chemistry:  1) Synthesis of Bioactive Natural                         
              Products, 2) Structural Recognition in the Complexation of                     
              Organic Compounds, 3) Exploratory Studies in Supramolecular                    
              Chemistry, 4) Unstable Reactive Intermediates from Singlet                     
              Oxygen, 5) Study of the Synthesis and Reactivity of Novel                      
              Boranes, Carboranes, and Metallacarboranes, and 6) Synthetic                   
              Organic Chemistry.                                                             
                                                                                             
              Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectrometry is the most                      
              powerful tool available to the chemist for the elucidation of                  
              the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown                    
              substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within                 
              molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between                   
              molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR                         
              spectroscopy is essential to chemists who are carrying out                     
              frontier research.  The results from these NMR studies are                     
              useful in areas such as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.
