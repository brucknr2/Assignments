Abstract    :
              In Phase I both total optical isolation and efficient                          
              guide to guide coupling were accomplished for the                              
              first time in silicon.  Based upon these                                       
              achievements, parallel arrays of electronically                                
              phase-modulated waveguide structures will be                                   
              fabricated in Phase II, configured to spatially                                
              dissect an incident coherent planar waveform, and                              
              used to rotate the output light-beam through                                   
              constructive interference effects in the far field.  A                         
              two dimensional array of phase-control channels                                
              would allow scanning the beam over the entire                                  
              image plane.  Initial efforts will be focused on                               
              fabrication and testing of a one dimensional,                                  
              horizontal array of rigid waveguides placed over a                             
              single buried SiO2 layer; this device has potential as                         
              an Optical Spectrum Analyzer for de-multiplexing                               
              sets of nominally 1.3 um laser signals running                                 
              simultaneously in a single fiber communication                                 
              system.  Later, a double buried SIMOX structure                                
              with two silicon cores will be constructed to                                  
              demonstrate the highly novel concept of vertical                               
              beam steering.  Integration of the two sets of guides                          
              into a two dimensional structure will allow rapid                              
              agile steering in both directions.
