Abstract    :
              This three year REU Site at Northwestern University on                         
              Infrastructure Innovation is designed to attract native born or                
              permanent residence students to research careers in this area                  
              within Civil Engineering and to nudge participants toward                      
              independent research.  Student interaction is maintained by twice              
              a week orientation meetings which address research skills common               
              to all work, as well as informal chats with the REU professors to              
              convey the excitement of a research career.  Research results are              
              presented both orally and in a report of sufficient quality for                
              publication to ensure training in technical communication.  As an              
              important addition, a new initiative will be undertaken to develop             
              a program for local industry to employ REU fellows for four                    
              additional weeks in research/development positions.  Post REU                  
              completion industrial placement will be increased each year with               
              a goal of 100% placement during the third year.
