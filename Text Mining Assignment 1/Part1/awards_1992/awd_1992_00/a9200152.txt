Abstract    :
                   This project will bring twelve undergraduate students to                  
              work at the Cornell Theory Center for a ten week period in                     
              the summer of 1992.  Recruiting will be national in scope,                     
              and there will be special efforts to bring in women,                           
              minorities, and students from institutions without rich                        
              computing resources.  Participants will work under the joint                   
              guidance of a faculty member from Cornell University, and a                    
              member of the scientific and technical staff of the Theory                     
              Center.  Problems in the area of computational science                         
              research will be investigated.
