Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a renewal proposal with a two-pronged approach.  The first             
              approach involves the development of new methodologies for the                 
              synthesis of metastable oxides.  The proposed methodologies involve            
              the chemical modification of materials at low temperatures.  The               
              oxides to be synthesized are the hexagonal form of MoO3 and its                
              modified oxides.  The second approach involves the development of              
              new phases, and the intended oxides are the oxides related to                  
              a-PbO2.  The objective of this proposal is to develop an                       
              understanding of the critical chemical factors affecting the                   
              synthesis of certain types of oxides.                                          
              %%%%                                                                           
              This proposal outlined a very good quality basic solid state                   
              chemistry research program dealing with specific types of oxides.              
              It aims to provide information about the critical factors which                
              affect the synthesis of the oxides chemically.
