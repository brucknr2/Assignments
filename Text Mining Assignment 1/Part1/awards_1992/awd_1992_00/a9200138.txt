Abstract    :
              The goal of this effort is to generate scientific knowledge and to             
              apply this knowledge to sensor development.  The REU Site is part              
              of the Summer Undergraduate Fellowship in Sensor Technologies                  
              (SUNFEST) program of the University of Pennsylvania's Center for               
              Sensor Technologies.  The Center provides the infrastructure for               
              faculty and students to collaborate, exchange ideas, co-supervise              
              students, and share resources.  Students are selected by a faculty             
              committee based on their academic potential, interest in pursuing              
              a research career, attitude towards graduate studies, advisors'                
              recommendations, membership in underrepresented groups, and                    
              research opportunities in the home institution.  Special emphasis              
              is placed on the broader interaction and communication of these                
              SUNFEST fellows with the graduate students and faculty members                 
              associated with the Center.  The projects suggested to the students            
              are chosen for their educational value, scientific merit, and the              
              prospects for continued involvement after the summer.
