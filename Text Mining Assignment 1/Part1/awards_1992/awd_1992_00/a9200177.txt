Abstract    :
                   This award provides support for two undergraduate                         
              researchers working under the supervision of the principal                     
              investigator on problems arising from number theory.  It is                    
              concerned with the roots of L-functions of number fields and of                
              algebraic curves.  The Riemann zeta function is the most famous                
              example of such an L-function.  Knowledge of the precise location              
              of the roots would have far reaching implications.  For example,               
              information on the  roots of the zeta function relates to the                  
              distribution of prime numbers, while the roots of the L-function               
              of a curve are related to the number of points on the curve.  The              
              students will study certain concrete cases - orthogonal                        
              polynomials which arise as Mellin transforms.  They have a                     
              particularly simple form, and the background needed to analyze                 
              these functions is not extension.  Symbolic computation using                  
              software such as Maple will play an important role in this work.
