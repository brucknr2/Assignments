Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor P. Terwilliger              
              to work in combinatorics.  He intends to investigate subconstituent            
              algebras for commutative association schemes.  In particular, he               
              intends to work on the classification of thin P- and Q-polynomial              
              schemes.  He also intends to study possible connections between                
              subconstituent algebras and quantum Lie algebras.                              
                   The research is in the general area of combinatorics.                     
              Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how                  
              discrete collections of objects can be organized.  And, so it is               
              extremely important to modern communications, for example the                  
              design of large networks as in telephone systems and the design of             
              algorithms in computer science.
