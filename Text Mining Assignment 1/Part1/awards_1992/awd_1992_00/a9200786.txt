Abstract    :
                   Work supported by this award will be done by two                          
              undergraduate researchers under the supervision of the principal               
              investigator.  They will be engaged in research on problems of                 
              mathematical statistics and related computing techniques.                      
              Students will learn to use statistical tools in descriptive                    
              statistics and inferential statistics as well as multidimensional              
              scaling techniques.  Projects will be selected from the study of               
              speech and communication disorders, monitoring growing waters for              
              mulluscan shellfish, health care programs for sickle cell disease              
              and hyteresis in macroeconomic theory.                                         
                   Students will be encouraged to prepare written reports of                 
              their investigations and to present them at appropriate                        
              professional meetings.
