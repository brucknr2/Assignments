Abstract    :
                   A Research Experiences for Undergraduates site involving six              
              students will be supported by this award.  Their work will focus               
              on carefully selected problems in applied probability.  Students               
              will be expected to combine collaborative and individual efforts               
              in their research.  At the end of the summer, the group will                   
              travel to a professional meeting such as the Institute for                     
              Mathematical Statistics/American Statistical Association joint                 
              meetings.  Students are expected to prepare written reports                    
              summarizing their work, many of which should lead to publishable               
              papers.  They will be encouraged to present their findings either              
              at meetings or at their home institutions.                                     
                   The theme of the research is that of discrete probability                 
              structures such as occurrence patterns and runs, competition                   
              models or occupancy problems.  Principal focus will be on the                  
              application of the Stein-Chen method of Poisson approximation,                 
              but students will also consider Gaussian limits and other non-                 
              Poisson approximations.
