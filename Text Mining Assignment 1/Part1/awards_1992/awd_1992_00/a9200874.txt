Abstract    :
                   This project involves the stability analysis of two                       
              problems: one in collisionless stellar dynamics and the other in               
              incompressible fluid flows.  In the former case, the energy-                   
              Casimir method will be used to examine the stability properties                
              of non-spherical galactic models.  In the latter case, ideas form              
              Hamiltonian systems and symmetries will be used to examine the                 
              nonlinear stability of Kida's periodic elliptic vortices in a                  
              planar straining flows, with applications to a study of three-                 
              dimensional vortex structures in the oceans.
