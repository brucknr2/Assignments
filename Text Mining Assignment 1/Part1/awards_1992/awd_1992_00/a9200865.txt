Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is a doctoral dissertation project to study women's                  
              responses to the child birth experience and to the medical                     
              treatment during childbirth.  In-depth interviews will be                      
              conducted with women before and after the birth of their child.                
              The study will contribute to the understanding of the social                   
              psychological processes which accompany childbirth and possibly                
              to the development of policies that would improve women's child                
              birth experience.
