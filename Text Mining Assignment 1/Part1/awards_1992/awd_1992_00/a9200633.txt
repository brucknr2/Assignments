Abstract    :
              This award supports Professors Juan Carlos Campuzano of                        
              the University of Illinois at Chicago and Arun Bansil                          
              of Northeastern University, to collaborate in materials                        
              research with Professors M. Lindroos and M. Pessa of                           
              the Physics Department of Tampere University of                                
              Technology, Finland.  They will carry out a joint                              
              theoretical and experimental program to investigate the                        
              electronic structure of the high-Tc superconductors via                        
              angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy.  Their                              
              research builds on the basis of highly productive past                         
              collaboration that has demonstrated the synergistic                            
              effect of their complementary theoretical and                                  
              experimental expertise.                                                        
                                                                                             
              With the increasing interest in angle-resolved                                 
              photoemission studies of superconducting compounds,                            
              there is a need to obtain corresponding theoretical                            
              intensities.  The proposed research will compare                               
              experimental spectra to first-principles predictions of                        
              the photoemission intensities in order to obtain                               
              significant new information and further understanding                          
              of the electronic structure of the new superconductors.                        
              Results should also help to establish the extent to                            
              which the conventional band theory picture can be used                         
              to describe the normal state electronic structure of                           
              the new materials.
