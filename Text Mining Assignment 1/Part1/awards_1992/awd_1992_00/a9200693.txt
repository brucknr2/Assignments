Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9200693  William E. Stewart     The development of a numerical
              model and the optimization of the independent parameters for analyzing ice
              crystal growth in falling film flow is proposed.  The model will be used to
              maximize the crystal growth rate in the falling film.  The heat transfer and
              ice crystal growth simulation results will be compared to some previous
              experimental results.  The numerical model will incorporate the interaction
              between the falling film fluid and the ice crystals by means of enhanced,
              effective thermal conductivities and reduced, effective viscosities.  The
              proposed research will establish a numerical model that can be used to optimize
              the parameters that govern ice crystal growth to maximize crystal growth rate.
