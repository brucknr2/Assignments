Abstract    :
                   This award in mathematical physics supports the continued                 
              development of the renormalization groups as a rigorous                        
              mathematical tool for the study of quantum field theory                        
              models.  In this way one can study the basic properties of                     
              theories which describe the elementary constituents of matter.                 
              It is also a tool for studying critical phenomena in                           
              statistical mechanical systems.
