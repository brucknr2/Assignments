Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to the Department of Biology at Princeton            
              University to continue a successful Research Experiences for                   
              Undergraduates SITE.  Advertising for the program will begin with              
              the mailing of information packets to over 200 institutions                    
              nationwide.  Special efforts will be made to recruit students from             
              underrepresented groups, including 1) mailing packets to the                   
              Directors of the MARC program as well as to institutions with                  
              substantial populations of minority students, 2) attending annual              
              meetings of minority students in the MARC Program and those from               
              institutions in California, 3) establishing sister relationships               
              with two minority colleges (Spelman and Lincoln Colleges) to                   
              facilitate participation of their students in the Princeton REU                
              program, and 4) visiting several other schools whose students are              
              predominantly from underrepresented groups.  The REU program at                
              Princeton is modeled after the undergraduate curriculum in                     
              molecular biology, which has a strong research component.  A                   
              faculty committee will select the participants, who will confer                
              extensively with the faculty advisor of their choosing to formulate            
              a detailed research plan.  From mid-June to mid-August students                
              will conduct original research with close guidance and supervision             
              from their faculty advisor and will have many opportunities for                
              scientific discussions.  The program will culminate in a poster                
              session, at which all participants will present their research                 
              results to the entire Department.
