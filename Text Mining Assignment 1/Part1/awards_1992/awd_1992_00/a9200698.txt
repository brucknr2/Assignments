Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The objective of this research is the physics of                          
              electrification of thunderstorms, including the lightning                      
              discharge, using a numerical cloud model.  The formulation of                  
              riming charge transfer will be guided by recent laboratory results             
              showing the significance of both temperature and liquid water                  
              content.  Also, the significance of ice splintering in producing               
              lower positive charge centers will also be investigated.                       
                                                                                             
                   Improvements in the lightning parameterization scheme will                
              include a randomization of the propagation path based on the                   
              presence of random free electrons in the vicinity of the discharge             
              tip, the inclusion of the tip electric field in the path                       
              calculation, and a simulation of the cloud-to-ground discharge.                
              These improvements and those mentioned above will be incorporated              
              in the three-dimensional model.  We will include a calculation of              
              the Maxwell current into our analysis software to test the                     
              inference of Krider and Musser (1982) concerning the role of                   
              inductive and noninductive processes in driving the Maxwell                    
              current.  Modeling studies of several new cases will be undertaken             
              with both 2D and 3D models to examine electrification processes in             
              various storms.
