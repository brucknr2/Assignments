Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will allow the PIs to continue the development of                   
              Thorium-230 profiling in marine sediments as a paleoceanographic               
              tool. Th-230 flux to seafloor has been shown to be largely                     
              independent of particulate flux, but closely related to the rate of            
              production in the water column. This property can be exploited to              
              independently calculate sediment flux to the seafloor. Sediment                
              trap work accomplished so far supports this model for modern                   
              sediment flux and in the next phase the work will be carried back              
              to isotopic stage 5/6 in Southern Ocean.
