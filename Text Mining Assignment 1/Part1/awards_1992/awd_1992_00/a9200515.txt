Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal examines the fatigue process in metal single crystals            
              using transmission electron microscopy to observe dislocation                  
              dynamics.  The investigator plans in-situ reverse deformation                  
              experiments in a high voltage transmission electron microscope                 
              (HVEM).  A unique loading instrument has been devised to avoid                 
              buckling of the specimens under stress reversal, a problem normally            
              encountered with this type of test.  The fatigue process and                   
              associated dislocations are imaged during strain reversals in                  
              relatively thick foils to provide insights into the fundamental                
              nature of fatigue and related Bauschinger effects.

              This research offers new capabilities for observing the fatigue                
              process in metal alloys.  The technique should allow observation of            
              the motion of dislocations over a significant range and should                 
              provide new insights to the fatigue process.
