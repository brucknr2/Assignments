Abstract    :
                   The project is to address the area of human-computer                      
              interaction.  The program will involve bringing ten students                   
              (five men and five women) to the university for a ten week                     
              period, with follow up in the academic year.  The students                     
              will be from Nebraska and immediately surrounding areas, with                  
              the majority from institutions other than the host.  Included                  
              in the program will be a seminar, the actual research                          
              project, and discussion of opportunities for graduate study.
