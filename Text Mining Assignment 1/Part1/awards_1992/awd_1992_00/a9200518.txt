Abstract    :
              The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program in the                     
              Chemistry Division is supporting research by Prof. Donald Kouri                
              at the University of Houston on a new approach to quantum                      
              dynamics calculations.  This is a collaborative project with                   
              Prof. David Hoffman of Iowa State University whose effort is                   
              also being supported by the Division.  The Feynman path                        
              integral method is used to replace the customary calculation of                
              matrix products, eigenvalues, and inverses which scale very                    
              rapidly with system size.  Gaussian importance sampling is used                
              to produce a manageable variance in the Monte Carlo integral.                  
              The goal is to make possible fully quantum mechanical treatment                
              of scattering systems of a larger size than previously possible.

              Numerically exact quantum mechanical methods of analyzing                      
              chemical reactions have in the past been limited to systems                    
              containing no more than three atoms, at least one of which must                
              be hydrogen.  This project is testing a new computational                      
              technique which offers promise of permitting such calculations                 
              on larger systems and, more generally, can be used in studying                 
              other quantum mechanical collisional processes.
