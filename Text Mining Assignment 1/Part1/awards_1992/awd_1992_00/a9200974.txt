Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This grant provides support for students to attend the 7th World               
              Conference on Titanium to be held in San Diego in June 1992.                   
              This is a large conference, 800 - 1000 people anticipated, with                
              approximately 350 technical papers.  Eighteen plenary papers and               
              critical reviews are planned, which cover refining, processing,                
              alloy theory and design, advanced alloys, mechanical properties,               
              nanostructures, applications, and nondestructive testing.  The NSF             
              funds are to be used for supporting student registration fees, a               
              "Best Student Paper" competition, and student poster sessions.                 
              %%%                                                                            
              Titanium alloys are widely used in structures and the chemical                 
              industry.  This conference examines recent advances in refining,               
              processing, and advanced alloys, which should expand the                       
              applications of this important class of alloys.
