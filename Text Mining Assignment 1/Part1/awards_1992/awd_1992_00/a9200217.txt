Abstract    :
                   Portland State University of the Oregon State System of Higher            
              Education, is ideally suited to conduct a field and laboratory                 
              project in the Lake Owyhee volcanics in eastern Oregon.  Students              
              will conduct geologic mapping and topic-specific research on                   
              volcanic, volcaniclastic, clastic, and hydrothermally altered                  
              rocks.  The studies will focus on relations among volcanism,                   
              sedimentation in fault-controlled basins, and hydrothermal activity            
              in a Miocene continental rift environment.                                     
                                                                                             
                   Students will participate for 10 weeks during the summer.  The            
              first six and one-half weeks will be spent on the field portion,               
              the next two on laboratory studies, and the final weeks will be                
              spent in writing and revising reports already partially prepared               
              in the field.  The reports will summarize the research topic, field            
              data, and will discuss the findings in light of available                      
              literature.                                                                    
                                                                                             
                   Follow up activities will focus on revision of the student                
              reports in preparation for presentation of the findings in a                   
              seminar in the student's home department and as a paper/poster at              
              a scientific meeting.  Students with particularly interesting                  
              findings will be encouraged to prepare jointly authored papers for             
              publication.
