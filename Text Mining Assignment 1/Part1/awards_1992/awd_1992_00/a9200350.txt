Abstract    :
              The Cornell University REU program in the Department of                        
              Agricultural and Biological Engineering is focussed on porous media            
              flow and biokinetic processes.  Both topics are of great interest              
              to agricultural and biological engineering students.  Activities               
              in composting organic materials and flow paths and associated                  
              biodegradation in field soils are planned.  The program is divided             
              into a summer and academic year program.  An environment where                 
              learning and sharing of experiences is encouraged is provided.  The            
              learning will occur during formal seminars and informal meetings               
              between fellows, professors and their research group.  During the              
              summer program, fellows will be housed together and dinners are                
              shared with various members of the research team.
