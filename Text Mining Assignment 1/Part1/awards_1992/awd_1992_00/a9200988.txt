Abstract    :
              This  program involves the design and synthesis of mixed ionic                 
              and electronic conducting membranes that promote decomposition                 
              of nitrogen oxides in automobile exhaust.  The strategy                        
              depends on a perovskite catalyst to decompose the nitrogen                     
              oxide and an oxide-ion "pump" to remove oxygen from the active                 
              site.  The conducting membrane and catalytic membrane may be                   
              the same or different materials.  Research objectives include                  
              optimization of the catalysts in solid-state electrolytic                      
              cells and optimization of the components of the mixed                          
              conducting membranes.  The research clarifies the mechanism of                 
              decomposition of nitrogen oxides at catalytic sites and the                    
              conditions required to maintain long-term activity.                            
              Characteristics of the solid-state membrane necessary for                      
              achieving rapid oxide-ion mediation away from the reaction                     
              site are identified; these are optimized for operation at                      
              representative automobile exhaust temperatures.                                
                                                                                             
              This is an SBIR Phase II effort.  It leads to a long-life,                     
              low-cost, membrane converter for removing nitrogen oxides from                 
              automobile exhausts.  This technology is especially applicable                 
              to lean-burn engines, which are expected to become dominant in                 
              the future because of their high fuel efficiency.//
