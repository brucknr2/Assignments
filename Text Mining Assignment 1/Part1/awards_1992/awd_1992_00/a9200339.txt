Abstract    :
              This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project                
              is in the field of chemistry.  For a three-year period                         
              beginning in 1992, eight undergraduate students will spend ten                 
              weeks each summer engaged in basic research in analytical,                     
              inorganic, organic, physical, and biochemistry under the                       
              direction of the faculty members in the Chemistry Department.                  
              A unique feature of this REU program is that only women and                    
              minorities will be recruited.
