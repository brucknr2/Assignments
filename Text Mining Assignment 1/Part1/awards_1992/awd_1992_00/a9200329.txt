Abstract    :
                   This award supports two undergraduate researchers working                 
              under the supervision of the principal investigator on problems                
              in two areas of mathematics.  In the first, number theory, the                 
              students will consider convergents of continued fractions reduced              
              by an integer, with special attention paid to cases involving                  
              very small periods.  Work will also be done in graph theory.                   
              Here the research will focus on polynomial invariants:                         
              distinguishing graphs by Tutte polynomials and unimodality of                  
              Whitney numbers.  If the schedule permits, studies of network                  
              reliability will also be conducted.
