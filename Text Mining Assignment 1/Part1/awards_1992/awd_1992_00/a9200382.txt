Abstract    :
              The Iowa State REU gives students research experience by                       
              participating in projects in microelectronics and photonics.  These            
              students work along side students supported by the Department of               
              Education Undergraduate Research Opportunities for Minorities as               
              well as the NSF Minority Scholars Program, and the NASA supported              
              Iowa Space Grants Program.  Specifically, these students work on               
              continuing and new projects in a) advanced silicon processing for              
              devices and integrated circuits, b) high power and high frequency              
              bipolar transistors and other microwave devices, c) III-V compound             
              quantum nanostructures, d) non-crystalline silicon structures for              
              energy conversion, and e) basic semiconductor material studies.                
              A microelectronics fabrication course is offered each summer of the            
              program.
