Abstract    :
              The Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project                 
              is in the field of chemistry.  For three summers beginning in                  
              1992, eight undergraduate students will spend ten weeks engaged                
              in basic research under the direction of the faculty members in                
              the Chemistry Department.  A major goal of this proposal is to                 
              provide hands-on experience in ongoing scientific research and                 
              to encourage students to continue their chemical education in                  
              graduate school.
