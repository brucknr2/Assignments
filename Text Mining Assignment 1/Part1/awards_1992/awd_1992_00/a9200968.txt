Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to determine leachate                        
              dispersion rates through soils using fiber optics. Various                     
              fiber optic chemical sensors will be embedded into                             
              saturated sand samples which are placed into a modified                        
              laboratory permeameter to determine if fiber optics sensors                    
              can be used to measure the dispersion rate of a saltwater                      
              leachate. If test proves successful it will be a quick and                     
              relatively inexpensive procedure available for measuring                       
              dispersion rates in soils. The dispersion rate is used in                      
              many transit time prediction models to determine the time                      
              for leachate to permeate through clay liners and to                            
              estimate the thickness of a clay liner in applications such                    
              as solid waste landfills.
