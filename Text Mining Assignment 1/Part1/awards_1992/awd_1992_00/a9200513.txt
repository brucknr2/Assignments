Abstract    :
                   This project will bring ten undergraduates to work in                     
              the Computer Science Department at the University of                           
              Missouri, Rolla in the summer of 1992.  Recruiting will be                     
              primarily from the midwest, and will be directed at students                   
              who have limited or no opportunities for research projects.                    
              The students will be introduced to the job of a researcher,                    
              and to basic research techniques.  Students will be involved                   
              in the design, analysis, and implementation of parallel                        
              combinatorial optimization algorithms, to include parallel                     
              composite graph coloring algorithms.
