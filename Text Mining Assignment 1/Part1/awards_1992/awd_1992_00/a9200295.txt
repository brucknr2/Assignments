Abstract    :
              Multivalent impurity centers in silver chloride and silver bromide             
              play an important role in photographic processes.  This project                
              uses perturbed angular correlation measurements of indium-111,                 
              which is introduced as a probe nucleus in the silver halides.  The             
              research addresses the structure of the indium-vacancy complex,                
              electron and hole trapping at the defect complexes, stability of               
              the complexes, the dynamics of vancancy motion around the                      
              complexes, and the metastability of the configurations following               
              nuclear decay to cadmium -111.  The primary objective of the                   
              research is to improve the understanding of defect properties in               
              halides, and to relate the results to the role that these or                   
              similar defects play in the photographic process.  The research                
              involves a university-industry collaboration between the University            
              of North Carolina and Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, New York.
