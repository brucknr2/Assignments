Abstract    :
              This project builds on an established state-of-the-art in                      
              electromagnetic geotomography used for imaging buried geo-                     
              structures in mining, exploration, geotechnology, security, and                
              environmental waste management applications. The study focuses on              
                                                                                             
              specific multidimensional signal-processing issues in the                      
              reconstruction of images from through-rock electromagnetic                     
              transmission measurements, and covers image fidelity                           
              quantification, tomography algorithms for combined attenuation-                
              phase-frequency measurement data, and space sampling strategies                
              in                                                                             
              site surveying and in image construction.
