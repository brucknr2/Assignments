Abstract    :
                   Eight undergraduates will be supported by this Research                   
              Experiences for Undergraduates renewal award.  It is an activity               
              which articulates closely with the institution's own                           
              project-based undergraduate research program.  The three faculty               
              advisors are well-versed in the philosophy of undergraduate                    
              research participation.  Excellent results achieved during the                 
              past four REU sites amply demonstrate their capabilities.                      
                   Students will work in teams in one or more problem areas.                 
              Typical of these include studies of highly irregular graphs, edge              
              domination numbers of graphs, Hamming distances, pseudo-Boolean                
              functions and excess problems related to birigid graphs.  Much of              
              the research involves a degree of computer experimentation which               
              will be integrated into the early stages of the program.                       
                   All students will be required to communicate their completed              
              work as well as work in progress both orally and in writing.                   
              Finally, they will be encouraged to present their results at an                
              appropriate academic meeting and to revise their reports for                   
              journal submission where significant progress has been made.
