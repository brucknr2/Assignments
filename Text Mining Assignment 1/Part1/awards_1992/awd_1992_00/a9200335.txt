Abstract    :
              This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project                
              is in the field of chemistry.  For a three-year period                         
              beginning April 1992, eight (8) undergraduate students will                    
              spend ten (10) weeks engaged in basic research under the                       
              direction of the faculty members in the Chemistry Department.                  
              A focal point of the proposed projects is the study of                         
              synthesis, structure, and dynamics at the interface between                    
              inorganic, organic, and bio-organic chemistry.  A special                      
              seminar program will be included in which the students will be                 
              exposed to special topics in modern chemical research and to                   
              careers in science.  This seminar program, together with                       
              participation in regular research group meeting, will also give                
              the students experience in reporting on their own research                     
              progress and in acquiring a greater ability to communicate                     
              scientific information.  The underlying aim of the overall                     
              program is to give students strong incentives for pursuing                     
              careers in the science field.
