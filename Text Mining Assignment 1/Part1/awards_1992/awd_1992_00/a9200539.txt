Abstract    :
                   In degree theory, one tries to determine whether natural                  
              classes of oracles with differing information content have                     
              different algebraic properties.  Thus questions about decidability             
              of fragments of elementary theories of degree structures are                   
              pursued, in order to determine which degrees are definable, and how            
              complicated the definitions must be.  Rigidity questions, or                   
              questions about automorphisms of the structures are pursued, with              
              the aim that if a structure is rigid, then sets with different                 
              information content do, in fact, look different algebraically.                 
              Such questions are within the scope of this project.  The major                
              tool of proof in recursion theory is the priority argument.  A                 
              general framework for priority arguments at all levels is being                
              sought, in the hope that a better understanding of priority                    
              arguments will assist in finding applications of this powerful                 
              combinatorial technique to real world problems.                                
                   Computing, as it is practiced today, is of an interactive                 
              nature.  Rather than the model of twenty years ago, where the                  
              computer was presented with a program and ran until it obtained an             
              answer, the programs of today pause frequently and ask for input               
              before continuing.  Thus the true model of computing, as it is                 
              practiced, is the Turing machine with an oracle.
