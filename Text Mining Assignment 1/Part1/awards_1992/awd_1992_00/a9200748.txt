Abstract    :
              Zemanian         This research is on three dimensional modeling methods for 
              predicting performance and characteristics of VLSI-ULSI circuits  and devices. 
              The research topics are:  1.     three dimensional corner corrections for
              capacitance  calculations;  2.     inductance computations and transmission
              line parameters;  and  3.     dominant paths in interconnect networks including
              path  ranking.         These computations are needed for assessment of delay
              times  in off-chip interconnection lines and for modeling pulse  propagation
              through MOSFET circuits.  The approach is to use  infinite electrical network
              theory to simplify the computation of  coupling between interconnection lines
              and adjacent devices.   This theory leads to efficient numerical methods,
              including  domain contraction techniques, which yield more powerful 
              computation algorithms.
