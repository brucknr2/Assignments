Abstract    :
              In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organo-                     
              metallic Chemistry Program, Dr. Hillhouse will continue his                    
              studies on the organometallic chemistry of nitrous oxide.                      
              Specific objectives of the study include the development of new                
              preparative methods for the synthesis of oxometal complexes,                   
              development of selective methods for oxidation of organic                      
              molecules, and exploration of the binding of nitrous oxide by                  
              metal complexes.  Both early and late transition metal systems                 
              will be studied.                                                               
              %%%                                                                            
              Nitrous oxide has a well deserved reputation as an unreactive                  
              gas; however, thermodynamically it is a very potent oxidant and                
              when used as an oxidizing reagent would give dinitrogen as an                  
              environmentally benign reduction product.  In spite of its                     
              usual low reactivity nitrous oxide is a threat to the                          
              environment.  Therefore fundamental studies of its reactivity                  
              have the potential for development of an oxidant with no                       
              harmful by-products and to provide for new ways to deal with an                
              environmental threat.
