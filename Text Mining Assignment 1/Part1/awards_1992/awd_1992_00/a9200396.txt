Abstract    :
              The School of Civil Engineering and Environmental Science at the               
              University of Oklahoma is establishing a REU site with a special               
              focus on the development of enhanced materials and structural                  
              components used for small-scale modeling.  Three laboratory                    
              projects have been identified for the program:  the design of                  
              improved micro-concrete mixtures, bond strength of deformed small-             
              scale reinforcing bars in micro-concrete, and small scale modeling             
              of base isolation systems.  All three projects improve the                     
              capabilities of small-scale models used to investigate the seismic             
              performance of new or existing structural systems.  Students will              
              be divided into three equal size groups.  Each group will work on              
              one project for two months.  This REU site will provide a "total"              
              experience to the participants:  learning, research, report                    
              writing, and presentation.
