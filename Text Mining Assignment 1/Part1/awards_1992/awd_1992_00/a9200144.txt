Abstract    :
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work                 
              of Professor Silas C. Blackstock at Vanderbilt University.                     
              Electron transfer mediated fragmentations and rearrangements                   
              will be examined.  In particular, fragmentations of                            
              nitrogen-containing substrates such as diazenes, nitroso                       
              compounds, and azooxides, and rearrangements of                                
              methylenecyclopropane and allyl vinyl ether will be examined                   
              under oxidative conditions.  Short lived radical ion                           
              intermediates will be spectroscopically characterized by low                   
              temperature solid state and solution ESR methods.  The                         
              structures of the radical ion intermediates will be engineered                 
              to enhance their lifetimes in order to allow their direct                      
              observations.  Reaction rate measurements to determine electron                
              transfer mediated rate accelerations and product analysis to                   
              evaluate mechanistic hypotheses will also be conducted.                        
              %%%                                                                            
              The removal of an electron from an organic molecule frequently                 
              results in cleavage of the molecule or rearrangement of the                    
              connectivity of its atoms.  In this project a variety of carbon                
              and nitrogen containing substrates will be used to examine                     
              these reactions.  These processes are energetically  costly or                 
              nonexistant in the neutral precursors.  This work  will study                  
              the electron deficient intermediates directly in order to                      
              understand how electron transfer accelerates these reactions.                  
              Knowledge gained from this study will facilitate informed                      
              development of new electron transfer applications in organic                   
              chemistry.
