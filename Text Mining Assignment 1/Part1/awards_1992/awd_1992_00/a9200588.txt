Abstract    :
              This project, sponsored jointly by the Chemistry Division                      
              (Experimental Physical Chemistry) and the Division of Molecular                
              and Cellular Biosciences (Biochemistry and Molecular Structure                 
              and Function), is devoted to understanding primary photochemical               
              processes in photosynthesis. Professors Fleming and Mets (Univ.                
              of Chicago) will perform genetic modification of purple                        
              bacteria and of higher plants, obtaining modified reaction                     
              centers which are suitable for ultrafast (femtosecond) laser                   
              spectroscopic studies. The electronic and vibrational dephasing                
              times obtained from these measurements will be used with                       
              appropriate theory to build up a complete molecular description                
              of the photosynthetic unit.

              Understanding the chemical mechanisms by which plants convert                  
              sunlight into energy (photosynthesis) is a problem of                          
              outstanding technological importance as well as fundamental                    
              scientific interest. The very early steps in this process, in                  
              which light first strikes the plant and is somehow trapped,                    
              occur so fast that light itself has time to travel less than                   
              0.00001 feet before the trapping event is over. Professors                     
              Fleming and Mets (University of Chicago) will genetically                      
              engineer plants with special pigments suitable for performing                  
              ultrafast spectroscopic measurements of the primary chemical                   
              reactions. This will permit a complete molecular description of                
              the photosynthetic unit.
