Abstract    :
                   Strike-slip faults commonly occur in oblique convergence                  
              settings resulting in significant margin-parallel translation.  The            
              western coast of South America is an example where both sinistral              
              dextral strike-slip faulting of Jurassic to the recent is expected.            
              However, existing paleomagnetic data indicates local rotations of              
              blocks but little translation along the large orogen-parallel                  
              Atacama Fault.  This project will investigate layered volcanic                 
              rocks ranging in age from Jurassic to mid-Tertiary to detect and               
              interpret rotations and translations along poorly known portion of             
              the fault.  Results are expected to document the role of tectonic              
              translations in this active orogen and to shed light on the curious            
              preliminary result of rotations but little translations along this             
              major orogen-parallel fault.
