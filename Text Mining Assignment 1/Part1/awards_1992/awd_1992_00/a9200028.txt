Abstract    :
              This investigation will focus on two aspects of the regulation of              
              genes for bioluminescence (lux) of Vibrio harveyi:  (1) The control            
              of expression of lux genes by cell density and other environmental             
              signals and (2) the mechanism which generates diversity of                     
              spontaneous variants with different intensities of luminescene.                
              The genetic circuitry controlling expression of luminescence                   
              appears to be complex and to consist of interconnected pathways of             
              signal transduction which modulate transcription of operon                     
              (luxC,D,A,B,E) encoding the luminescence enzymes.  At least seven              
              loci controlling expression of luminescence (luxJ,K,L,M,N,O,R) have            
              now been identified by a variety of methods in this laboratory.                
              These loci are not linked to the operon encoding the luminescence              
              enzymes and have been cloned for further analysis.  Density-                   
              dependent regulation is known to involve a pherome-like substance              
              called autoinducer, and studies are planned to identify those genes            
              responsible for synthesis and response to this signal molecule as              
              well as those genes required for the responses to other signals                
              such as iron availability.  Specific experiments include:  (1)                 
              transposon mutagenesis of cloned fragments to localize the lux                 
              regulatory genes; (2) gene replacement mutagenesis in the native               
              organism to obtain mutants for characterization of the function of             
              the regulatory genes; (3) subcloning of lux regulatory genes to                
              reassemble control function in recombinant E.coli; (4) construction            
              of indicator gene fusions and mRNA measurements to define                      
              regulatory interactions and hierarchical control relationships; (5)            
              DNA sequencing to analyze the structure of the regulatory proteins             
              and the cis-acting control regions; and (6) genome structure                   
              probing with cloned lux genes to detect and characterize DNA                   
              rearrangements thought to cause variation in luminescence                      
              phenotypes.  Genetic analysis of luminescence regulation should                
              yield insight into mechanisms bacteria use to perceive and react to            
              their environment, and analysis of variation should reveal                     
              mechanisms for creating the genetic diversity needed for adaption              
              to varied and changing circumstances.
