Abstract    :
                   This proposal will bring twelve undergraduate students                    
              for a ten week session at Syracuse University in the summer                    
              of 1992.  At least seven will be from locations external to                    
              Syracuse University.  The program will combine the resources                   
              of the Syracuse Center for Computational Sciences, the                         
              Northeast Parallel Architecture Center, the Department of                      
              Physics, and the School of Computer and Information Science.                   
              A particular effort will be made to attract women,                             
              minorities, and persons with disabilities.  The areas from                     
              which the projects will be selected include the following:                     
              parallel computing software and algorithms, pattern                            
              recognition and computer vision, neural networks,                              
              optimization problems, virtual reality, computational                          
              condensed matter physics, statistical mechanics, nonlinear                     
              dynamics, and use of computers in education.
