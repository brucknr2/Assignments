Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                   This is a doctoral dissertation project to study interfirm               
              networks among U.S. and Italian apparel firms.  The purpose of the             
              study is to examine how the network structure itself and the nature            
              of the ties between firms affect organizational growth and decline.            
              The study will use union data on transactions between firms                    
              combined with data on company borrowing, creditors, and employment.            
              The statistical analysis of these data will be augmented by                    
              ethnographic field research consisting of interviews with                      
              representatives of firms in New York and Italy.
