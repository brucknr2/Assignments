Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to the Department of Psychobiology at the            
              University of California, Irvine to continue to sponsor a                      
              successful undergraduate research experience in Neural Plasticity              
              and Brain Function.  The program originated with a one-week                    
              undergraduate Summer Institute that was expanded with NSF funding.             
              The eight-week summer program begins with a one-week                           
              lecture/seminar series designed to introduce the students to the               
              field and to the research of the various faculty.  This is followed            
              by an active research experience in faculty laboratories on a                  
              defined project tailored to the goals of the student and their                 
              advisors.  Throughout this period, students continue to interact               
              with faculty in both formal and informal meetings.  At the end of              
              the program, students present their findings to other students in              
              the Department and to the faculty.
