Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award is for the purchase of computer equipment to enhance the            
              existing UNIDATA program within the School of Earth and Atmospheric            
              Sciences at Georgia Institute of Technology.  Specifically existing            
              workstations will be upgraded and the a PC for classroom                       
              presentation will be acquired.  This upgrade will provide UNIDATA              
              capabilities to faculty and students throughout the university                 
              through the campus LAN.  The UNIDATA system will be used for                   
              research and teaching in about equal proportions.  Examples of                 
              research studies that will use the UNIDATA software are: the                   
              generation and propagation of tropospheric gravity waves and                   
              Atmospheric Boundary Layer Experiment Ozone and Trace-Gas Field                
              Program.  Also, this equipment award will better enable the PIs to             
              educate graduate students in the meteorological sciences and                   
              attract and retain undergraduates to a career in the sciences.
