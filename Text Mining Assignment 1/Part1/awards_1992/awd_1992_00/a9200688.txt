Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research is concerned with the investigation of a new class of            
              oxygen ion conductors having intrinsic  oxygen ion vacancies. The              
              materials consist of structures based on the Aurivillius phases                
              that have their perovskitic region substituted with brownmillerite-            
              like structures containing intrinsic oxygen vacancies.  The                    
              materials will be characterized by complex impedance spectroscopy,             
              x-ray diffraction, and differential thermal analysis.  The proposed            
              work will bead to the preparation of a new class of oxygen ion                 
              conductors, and will result in a better understanding of factors               
              affecting the activation energy and the magnitude of the oxygen ion            
              conductivity.  These materials can become components of fuel cells             
              or be utilized in air separation technologies.
