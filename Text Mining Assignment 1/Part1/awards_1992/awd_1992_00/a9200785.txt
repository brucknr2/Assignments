Abstract    :
              The detailed understanding of the deposition and transfer of                   
              energy in the upper atmosphere requires a detailed understanding               
              of the basic interactions between the various ions, atoms, and                 
              molecules in the atmosphere.  Laboratory measurement of these                  
              properties is complicated because of the many states involved.                 
              This award provides  continuing support for laboratory                         
              measurements aimed at determining important cross sections for                 
              interactions between selected states involving the aeronomically               
              important ion O+ and the N2 molecule.  Similar reactions of                    
              generally lesser importance involving other atmosphere species                 
              can also be studies.  Especially important is the prospect of                  
              obtaining results at the low electron energies of most importance              
              for aeronomy of the earth's atmosphere.  The PI has made                       
              important progress in developing specialized equipment for this                
              research, and it is expected that the results of this work will                
              be important for many fundamental problems in the understanding                
              of the atmospheres of the terrestrial planets.
