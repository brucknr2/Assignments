Abstract    :
              This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project                
              is in the area of chemistry.  For three summers beginning April                
              1992, twelve undergraduate students will spend ten weeks                       
              engaged in research in the chemical sciences.  The focus of                    
              some of the research projects are programs at the academic/                    
              industrial interface.  Some students will be guided in their                   
              work by mentors permanently employed in industry.  Others will                 
              be given the opportunity to meet industrial scientists in their                
              research setting, to discuss careers in chemistry with them,                   
              and to learn about the role chemical research plays in                         
              industrial development.
