Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to the Department of Biology at the                  
              University of New Mexico, Albuquerque to continue a successful                 
              Research Experiences for Undergraduates program in association with            
              the Sevilleta LTER SITE.  Ten undergraduate students per year will             
              participate in ecological research projects in central New Mexico.             
              As part of the NSF Long-Term Ecological Research Network, the                  
              Sevilleta LTER site provides REU students with a unique opportunity            
              to examine ecological processes at the boundaries of several major             
              southwestern biomes (Chihuahuan Desert, Great Plains Grassland,                
              Great Basin Shrub-Steppe, Interior Chaparral, Pinyon-Juniper                   
              Woodland, Montane Coniferous Forest, and Sub-Alpine Forest/Meadow).            
              The program will capitalize on the diversity of the 21 Sevilleta               
              LTER faculty, who collaborate on a wide array of scientific studies            
              in meteorology, botany, zoology, paleoecology, watershed dynamics,             
              nutrient cycling, and landscape ecology.  The REU Program includes:            
              1) weekly orientation and progress meetings, 2) field and                      
              laboratory training in research concepts and techniques, 3)                    
              independent student research projects, 4) seminar series and                   
              university classwork, 5) group field trips, 6) pre- and post-                  
              project oral presentations, and 7) project manuscript preparation              
              and submission to journals.  These activities will integrate all               
              theoretical and technical aspects of the LTER and promote an                   
              holistic approach to large-scale, ecological studies.
