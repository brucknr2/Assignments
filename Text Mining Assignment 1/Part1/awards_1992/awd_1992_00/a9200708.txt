Abstract    :
              This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project                
              is in the field of chemistry.  For a three-year period                         
              beginning in 1992, eight undergraduate students will spend ten                 
              weeks each summer engaged in basic research under the direction                
              of the faculty members in the Chemistry Department.  A                         
              comprehensive program of academic research and social                          
              experiences has been planned.  The participants will work                      
              closely with a specific faculty mentor and research group in a                 
              chemical subdiscipline of their choice.  They will participate                 
              in a seminar series given by academic and industrial speakers                  
              and designed specifically for them.  They will present their                   
              results in informal group and divisional meetings, and in a                    
              Program-ending Departmental Poster Session.
