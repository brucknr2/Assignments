Abstract    :
              Aerogels of litania and zirconia are prepared and evaluated as                 
              supports for sulfate-ion superacids.  The aerogels are                         
              synthesized using a sol-gel process in conjunction with                        
              supercritical laying.  The stability and crystallization                       
              behavior of these materials in response to heat treatments,                    
              both with and without the addition of sulfate ions, are                        
              studied by nitrogen adsorption, X-ray diffraction,  and                        
              differential thermal analysis.  Acid properties of sulfate-                    
              promoted aerogels are characterized with Hammett indicators,                   
              thermogravimeteric and infrared measurements of adsorbed                       
              pyridine, and the reaction of isobutane.                                       
                                                                                             
              Superacids (acids stronger than what can be obtained in water)                 
              are essential to many operations in several industries.  A                     
              number of liquid and gaseous superacids are available, but                     
              they invariably present serious occupational or environmental                  
              hazards.  Solid superacids are much easier to control and                      
              contain and their development is a major objectives in the                     
              striving for a safer industrial environment. //
