Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a multi-university project to establish a                              
              coordinated research program on the effective design and use                   
              of computers in physics instruction.  The project has three                    
              major components: (1) Extension and refinement of an                           
              instructional theory grounded in the view that the                             
              development of validated mathematical models for physical                      
              phenomena is the main activity of physics.  (2) Application                    
              of the theory to the design of a versatile Modeling                            
              Workstation for computer-based instruction.  (3) Development                   
              of techniques for using computers to enhance instruction in                    
              large classes and integrate this with laboratory                               
              instruction.  The workstation will be equally applicable to                    
              classroom and laboratory instruction as well as to                             
              independent use by individual students.
