Abstract    :
                   The 1992 Symposium on the Interface of Computing Science and              
              Statistics will be held March 18-21, 1992 in College Station,                  
              Texas.  The Symposium is organized around the theme of "Graphics               
              and Visualization."  It is sponsored by the Interface Foundation               
              of North America and hosted by the Statistics Department of Texas              
              A&M University.  Professors James Blinn and Edward Tufte will                  
              give the keynote address and plenary session, respectively.                    
              These sessions should lead to discussion of how the new graphics               
              tools can be used in the study of data and statistical methods.                
              Sessions are being organized in the areas of Geographic                        
              Information Systems and Climate Research so that experts in these              
              areas can interact with computer scientists and statisticians.                 
              There will also be sessions in a number of statistical                         
              methodology areas as well as in very recent developments in                    
              numerical methods, including the Gibbs sampler and wavelets.                   
                   The 1992 Symposium on the Interface of Computing Science and              
              Statistics will be held March 18-21, 1992 in College Station,                  
              Texas.  The Symposium is organized around the theme of "Graphics               
              and Visualization."
