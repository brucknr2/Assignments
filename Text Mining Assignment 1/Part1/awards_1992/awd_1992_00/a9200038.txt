Abstract    :
              This award provides fund to continue a successful REU SITE at the              
              Department of Pharmacology, University of South Alabama.                       
              The focus of the undergraduate research program is cellular                    
              signaling, e.g., how hormones, calcium, cyclic nucleotides, protein            
              phosphorylation, and induction of specific intracellular proteins              
              may influence cell function.  Participating faculty have extramural            
              research support and ongoing, active research programs.                        
              Compensation and access to student facilities (e.g. library and                
              athletic facilities, housing and meal services) will be available              
              for all program participants.  Students will be provided a research            
              experience in a laboratory selected by them on the basis of summary            
              descriptions and discussion with the investigators.  In addition,              
              students will receive a formal review of the general area of                   
              cellular signalling via an organized weekly course.  At the end of             
              the summer, students will present their findings on Student                    
              Research Day.  Students will be recruited from regional                        
              undergraduate institutions that do not themselves provide formal               
              research experiences for undergraduates.  Recruiting will be                   
              accomplished through science counselors, mail brochures and campus             
              visits.  This particular match of student and research experience              
              will encourage talented students with little knowledge of the                  
              opportunities available in science to apply to Ph.D. programs and              
              embark on careers in science and technology.
