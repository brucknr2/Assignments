Abstract    :
              A REU Site will be established in the School of Chemical                       
              Engineering of Purdue University.  The goal of this site is to                 
              expose students (who would not otherwise receive such exposure) to             
              the opportunities provided by research careers and advanced degree             
              work.  The goal will be met by expanding the academic undergraduate            
              research program to provide a summer research opportunity for 12               
              students.  During their summer at Purdue the students will work on             
              original research projects in the chemical engineering sciences.               
              Special effort will be expended to attract women and members of                
              historically underrepresented groups to the program.
