Abstract    :
                   This project will bring eight undergraduates to the                       
              National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the                  
              University of Illinois for a one semester experience during                    
              the school year.  Recruiting will be national in scope.  The                   
              selected students will be matched with an NCSA research                        
              project in accordance with their interests and background.                     
              The disciplinary focus will be in the computational sciences,                  
              with particular emphasis in the application of                                 
              parallelization and visualization concepts and techniques.
