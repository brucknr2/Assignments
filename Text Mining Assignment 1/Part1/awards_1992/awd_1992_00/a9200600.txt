Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This award supports a multidisciplinary study of three lakes              
              in eastern interior Alaska to investigate how lake-levels,                     
              vegetation, and sedimentary processes are related to climate                   
              change.  The study will focus on the late Wisconsin and early                  
              Holocene (c.a. 14,000 to 6000 years B.P.), a period of marked and              
              relatively rapid climatic change.  The lakes are expected to be                
              sensitive to climatic fluctuations and have sedimentation rates                
              rapid enough to record high-frequency events.  This work has three             
              components:  1. assessment of the detail with which a lake-level               
              record can be constructed; 2. comparison of high resolution records            
              of vegetation change from fossil pollen with the lake-level record             
              to examine how lakes and vegetation differ in their response to                
              climate change; 3. the construction of basic hydrologic budgets for            
              each lake and their use to estimate past values of important                   
              parameters of the hydrologic system, in particular precipitation.              
              This project represents an element of the PALE project                         
              (Paleoclimates of Arctic Lakes and Estuaries).
