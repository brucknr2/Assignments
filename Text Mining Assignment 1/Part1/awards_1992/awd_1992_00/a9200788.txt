Abstract    :
              Probabilistic methods in Computer Science range from design of                 
              algorithms to analysis of typical behavior of algorithms to                    
              proving lower bounds in complexity theory.  This research will                 
              concentrate on a number of specific problems where application                 
              of the probabilistic method seems promising.  The questions                    
              include graph algorithms (finding approximation algorithms for                 
              the coloring problem and the independent set size problem),                    
              parallel sorting (in the so-called PRAM model), as well as                     
              algebraic questions (diameter of Cayley graphs), problems in                   
              circuit complexity (non-linear lower bounds), and complexity                   
              of on-line algorithms.  Based on past experience, the                          
              asymptotic combinatorial tools are expected to be applicable                   
              more broadly, beyond the problems stated.
