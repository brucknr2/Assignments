Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to the Department of Environmental                   
              Sciences at the University of Virginia to establish a research                 
              program for undergraduates where basic principles of ecology will              
              be taught, and the methods by which scientists increase our                    
              understanding of the natural will be detailed.  Two major                      
              objectives will be to:  1) teach students that science is a process            
              of acquiring evidence and making inference, and not a collection of            
              immutable facts; and 2) increase the ecological and environmental              
              literacy of scientists, professionals, and policy makers.  The                 
              program will include a diversity of students in terms of their                 
              interests, backgrounds, and career goals--participants will be                 
              recruited from the hundreds of colleges/universities in the mid-               
              Atlantic area.  The focus of the program is on testing hypotheses              
              related to plant-animal interactions, a topic of considerable basic            
              and applied interest, and one that has considerable heuristic                  
              value.  Students will conduct research in a field-station setting              
              at the Blandy Experimental Farm, a biological field station of the             
              University of Virginia, and will be immersed in a community of 15              
              to 20 graduate/post-doctoral researchers.  Field trips will focus              
              on issues related to conservation; a weekly seminar series at the              
              Farm will also add to the research experience.  Faculty wages, and             
              fees for laboratory space and dorm rooms will be contributed as                
              cost share items.
