Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              At the present time there are two programs within the National                 
              Science Foundation (NSF) specifically dedicated to enabling                    
              students at undergraduate institutions to participate in research              
              activities.  They are the Research Experience for Undergraduates               
              (REU) Program and the Research Experience for Undergraduate Site               
              Programs.  The REU Supplement Program allows current holders of NSF            
              grants or cooperative agreements to submit requests to provide                 
              support for an undergraduate student, while the Sites Program is               
              usually run at fairly large facilities where the infrastructure is             
              large enough to absorb the number of students and staff-time is                
              available to co-ordinate the program.                                          
                                                                                             
              This award will provide a mechanism of access to research funds to             
              undergraduates not currently reached by these existing programs.               
              The American Astronomical Society (AAS) will administer a program              
              of REU supplements to be made available to faculty who currently               
              do not hold grants from the NSF but who wish to involve                        
              undergraduates in their research activities.  Applications will be             
              made directly to the AAS for support of such students.  The AAS                
              will review the applications and select a group of twelve faculty              
              who will, subject to the approval of the NSF, receive funds from               
              this grant to enable an undergraduate at their institution to                  
              participate in the research activities of the faculty member.
