Abstract    :
              The purpose of this study is to 1) provide a large scale                       
              organizational test of an extended version of the Davis, et al                 
              Techonology Acceptance Model (TAM) (Davis, F., Bagozzi, Warshow,P.,            
              "User Accepatace of Computer Technology:  A Comparison of Two                  
              Theoretical Models.: Management Science, vol. 35,no.9(Aug. 1989,               
              pp.982-1003) and 2) to determine the extent to which the deployment            
              and use of personal computer workstations leads to improved                    
              individual and organizational productivity. The research involves              
              a study of the antecedents use of a stock broker's woukstation                 
              system and the subsequent impacts on individual and branch office              
              porductivity as related to the workstation's use or non-use.  The              
              research model is drawn and extended from a model porposed by                  
              Davis, et al (1989).  The research design includes a longitudinal              
              study with groups of offices implementing the new system compared              
              against control groups with the system.  The controlled research               
              design helps to determine the impact of the new technology on                  
              individual and group productivity using economic outcome variables.
