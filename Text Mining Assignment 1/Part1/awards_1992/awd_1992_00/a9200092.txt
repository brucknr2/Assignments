Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports the activities of a Research Experiences for               
              Undergraduates (REU) site hosted by the Department of Astronomy and            
              Astrophysics at Pennsylvania State University.  This award enables             
              approximately six to eight undergraduate students to perform                   
              astronomical research with professional scientists at Penn State               
              during the summer months.  Under the direction of Drs. Lawrence W.             
              Ramsey and Margaret M. Chester, students will do research on a                 
              variety of topics in astronomy, and will have access to telescope              
              facilities, image processing laboratories, and optical and space               
              instrument laboratories.  Supplementing their research, students               
              will attend a weekly seminar series in which faculty will discuss              
              introductory astronomy material and students will be able to                   
              present the results of their own work later in the summer.                     
                                                                                             
              REU sites such as the one planned at Pennsylvania State University             
              are important in increasing the technical and scientific skills of             
              the Nation's most talented and motivated undergraduates, and in                
              enabling those students to experience state-of-the-art scientific              
              research before they make their final career decisions.
