Abstract    :
              This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project                
              is in the area of chemistry.  During the summer of 1992, twelve                
              undergraduate students will spend ten weeks engaged in research                
              in the chemical sciences, under the direction of various                       
              members of the faculty in chemistry.  The students will                        
              participate with Baylor students and students from several                     
              foreign exchanges in cross-cultural experiences in addition to                 
              weekly seminars, an end of summer undergraduate research                       
              symposium, especially designed classes in modern                               
              instrumentation, and glassblowing.  Trips to nearby industries                 
              and research institutions will be organized.
