Abstract    :
              This program addresses the need to ensure the adequate supply of               
              scientists and engineers by exposing undergraduate minority                    
              students to research in the critical phase of his/her educational              
              career.  The students will be trained in the area of                           
              microelectronics.  The undergraduates will be exposed to a variety             
              of disciplines, including material science, mechanics, thermal                 
              science and electrical and electronic engineering.
