Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will use viscosity solution                    
              techniques to analyse evolutionary phase transitions, singular                 
              stochastic controls, and boundary control problems.  The work on               
              mean curvature flows will lead to a better understanding of the                
              relation between differential geometry and the mathematical                    
              theory of fluids.                                                              
                   Motion by mean curvature is one example of evolution of                   
              surfaces determined by their shape.  Evolutionary interface                    
              problems describe phase transition boundaries and the motion in                
              physical materials.
