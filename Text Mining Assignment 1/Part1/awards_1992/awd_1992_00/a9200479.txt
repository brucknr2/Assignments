Abstract    :
                   The scientific staff of the University of Missouri                        
              Research Reactor (MURR) will conduct an NSF REU Program using                  
              facilities at the University's 10 megawatt research reactor.                   
              Scientists trained in physics, chemistry and biochemistry will                 
              supervise students working on projects in such fields as                       
              neutron optics, neutron diffraction, inelastic neutron                         
              scattering, analysis of stress in materials, macro-molecular                   
              structure, radiation defects, nuclear archaeology, geology,                    
              analytic epidemiology, nutrition and radiopharmaceutical                       
              chemistry.  The central focus of the proposed program is the                   
              use of neutrons to interrogate or alter specimens.  The MURR                   
              is an active and exciting research center for hosing these                     
              activities.  It is the highest powered university research                     
              reactor in the U.S. and operates 24 hours/day for 6-1/2 days                   
              each week.  In addition to the resident reactor staff and                      
              faculty from MU, the MURR hosts a steady stream of visitors,                   
              collaborators and students.  Neutron irradiation facilities                    
              include pneumatic tube, in-pool and flux-trap positions.  In                   
              addition there are six radial beam lines and a thermal-column                  
              facility.  The project areas previously mentioned will be                      
              studied by a variety of nuclear techniques including: neutron                  
              interferometry, single crystal and powder neutron diffraction,                 
              triple-axis neutron spectrometry, small angle neutron                          
              scattering, deep level transient spectroscopy, conventional                    
              and prompt neutron activation analysis, radionuclidic assay                    
              and radioisotope production.
