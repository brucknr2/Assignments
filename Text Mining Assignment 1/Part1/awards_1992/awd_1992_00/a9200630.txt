Abstract    :
              Funds are requested for partial support of the fourth Conference on            
              Folic Acid, Vitamin B12 and One Carbon Metabolism, to be held under            
              the auspices of the Federation of American Societies for                       
              Experimental Biology from August 2-7, 1992 at Vermont Academy,                 
              Saxton's River, Vermont.  This conference offers a unique                      
              opportunity for scientists from a broad group of disciplines, who              
              share an interest in folate, B12 and one carbon metabolism, to                 
              interact both formally and informally.  Sessions have been                     
              scheduled on the biosynthesis of folic acid and cobalamin, on the              
              mechanisms of folate- and cobalamin-dependent enzymes, on the                  
              structures of these enzymes, on transport and compartmentation of              
              folates, antifolates and cobalamin derivatives, and on clinical                
              evaluation of antifolates now in various phases of clinical trail.             
              A second major focus will be on the role of folate and                         
              B12-dependent enzymes in metabolism.  Sessions are planned on the              
              evaluation ofthe nutritional of both normal and diseased humans,               
              and the effects on metabolism of drugs that intervene in folate and            
              cobalamin-dependent reactions.                                                 
              %%%                                                                            
              This conference will bring together researchers and students who               
              are exploring the basic biochemistry and health/disease aspects of             
              folic acid, vitamin B12 and one carbon metabolism.  There will be              
              formal presentations of advances in these fields and informal                  
              discussions.
