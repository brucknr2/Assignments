Abstract    :
              Algorithms for solving problems in optimization, enumeration,                  
              reliability design, statistical mechanics and electronics will                 
              be studied on classes of planar and near-planar graphs.  The                   
              three main tools used to solve these problems are (1) the                      
              delta-wye reduction (DWR) algorithm -- which reduces a planar                  
              graph to a single edge by means of six elementary local                        
              tranformations, (2) the Erickson-Monma-Veinott (EMV) algorithm                 
              -- a dynamic programming algorithm that builds plane solution                  
              subgraphs up by patching together smaller subgraphs, and (3)                   
              the shortest enclosing walk (SEW) algorithm -- which encloses                  
              specified regions of the plane by a minimum length walk.  The                  
              main concentration will be in the following area:  reliability                 
              and associated enumeration problems, approximations schemes                    
              will be developed using the DWR algorithm to compute various                   
              measures of connectivity, Steiner trees and related network                    
              design problem, Ising models in statistical physics, and                       
              extensions and generalizations.
