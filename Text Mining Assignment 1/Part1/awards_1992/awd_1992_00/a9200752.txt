Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Funds are provided for partial support of the travel of about 20               
              U.S. participants in the 14th Congress of the International                    
              Primatological Society (IPS), to be held in Strasbourg, France,                
              on August 16-21, 1992.  The IPS is an international,                           
              interdisciplinary society of scientists who study nonhuman                     
              primates.  The aims of the IPS are to encourage all areas of                   
              primate research, to facilitate cooperation among workers of all               
              nationalities who are engaged in such research, and to promote                 
              the conservation and judicious scientific use of nonhuman                      
              primates throughout the world.  The IPS has approximately 1,000                
              active members in North and South America, Europe, Asia, and                   
              Africa.  The scheduled scientific program of the 14th Congress                 
              includes plenary lectures, symposia, paper sessions, workshops,                
              and exhibits.  In addition, there are a business meeting of the                
              general membership, meetings of the Executive Committee, and                   
              numerous opportunities for informal exchange among the                         
              membership.
