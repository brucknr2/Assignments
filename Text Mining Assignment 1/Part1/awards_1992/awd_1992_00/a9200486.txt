Abstract    :
              This is a unique conference which brings together academic and                 
              industrial researchers working in VLSI, architecture, CAD tools and            
              theory.  It provides a forum for interaction between people from               
              different backgrounds, with different priorities and different                 
              perspectives.  Parallel sessions have been avoided to allow better             
              sharing of information about different research topics in VLSI.                
              The conference is designed to contribute to a better understanding             
              of the Nation's scientific and engineering research base.
