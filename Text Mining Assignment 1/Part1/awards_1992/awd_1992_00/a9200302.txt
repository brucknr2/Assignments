Abstract    :
                   As an extension of the Complex Systems Summer Schools                     
              program at Santa Fe, a Winter School on Scaling and Self-                      
              Similarity will be held January 12-24, 1992 at the University                  
              of Arizona.  This grant contributes to the support of                          
              participants at the School.  The topics covered in lectures,                   
              seminars and computer workshops addressed to graduate students                 
              and post doctoral scientists include turbulence, percolation,                  
              critical phenomena, 1/f noise, fractals, scaling structures.
