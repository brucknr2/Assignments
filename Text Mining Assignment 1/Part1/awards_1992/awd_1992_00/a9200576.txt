Abstract    :
                   The principal investigators will study geometric scale-                   
              invariant elliptic partial differential equations. Such                        
              equations arise naturally in many fields of mathematics including              
              topology, geometry , and mathematical physics. The three specific              
              areas of research supported by this award are Dirac type                       
              operators, Yang- Mills equations, and curvature functionals.                   
                   This award will support research in the general area of                   
              differential geometry and global analysis. Differential geometry               
              is the study of the relationship between the geometry of a space               
              and analytic concepts defined on the space. Global analysis is                 
              the study of the overall geometric and topological properties of               
              a space by piecing together local information. Applications of                 
              these areas of mathematics in other sciences include the                       
              structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas boundaries, and                 
              the large scale structure of the universe.
