Abstract    :
              The Center for Energy Studies and the Department of Mechanical                 
              Engineering at University of Texas-Austin will involve                         
              approximately 36 undergraduates over a three year period in energy             
              research (12 per summer). Schools from which these students will               
              be recruited will have a high predominance of under-represented                
              groups enrolled, such as Prairie View A&M, Pan American, Texas                 
              Southern, Texas A&I, University of Texas at San Antonio, University            
              of Texas-El Paso. The goal is to have at least 75% of the                      
              participants chosen from the aforementioned schools in the female,             
              minority, or disabled categories.  The balance of the research                 
              opportunities will be awarded to qualified minority/female students            
              from the University of Texas-Austin campus.
