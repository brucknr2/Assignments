Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Oceanographic Instrumentation Program Supports requests to                 
              acquire instrumentation for the collection, processing and analysis            
              of Oceanographic data. This proposal from University of Southern               
              California (USC) requests funding for equipment that will be used              
              to support NSF-funded research cruises aboard the R/V VICKERS, a               
              220 foot vessel that is owned and operated by Univertiy.
