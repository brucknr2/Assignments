Abstract    :
                   An undergraduate research participation project will be                   
              held in the UNLV Physics Department during the summer of 1992,                 
              with follow-up activities during the 1992-93 academic year.                    
              The research efforts are in the areas of atomic, molecular and                 
              optical physics, astronomy, and condensed matter physics.                      
              Students will have the opportunity to obtain hands-on                          
              laboratory experience using lasers, to analyze astronomical                    
              data on a workstation using image analysis software, and                       
              perform numerical computation and simulation using the UNLV                    
              Cray supercomputer.  This program builds upon the successful                   
              experience of the past four years, in which undergraduates                     
              have worked in research laboratories in the department.                        
              Students will be recruited from UNLV undergraduates and from                   
              selected schools in the Los Angeles area.
