Abstract    :
              The FAMU/FSU College of Engineering is providing mechanical                    
              engineering juniors with training in the conduct of research and               
              participation in active faculty research projects.  The major                  
              objective is to increase student motivation to pursue and succeed              
              in the mechanical engineering profession.  Research experiences are            
              used 1) to demonstrate the relevance and professional applications             
              of basic and advanced course work, 2) to provide experiences in the            
              challenges and rewards of research and, thus, encouragement to                 
              pursue graduate degrees; and 3) to build mentoring bonds between               
              faculty and undergraduates which encourage retention and graduation            
              of members of underrepresented groups.
