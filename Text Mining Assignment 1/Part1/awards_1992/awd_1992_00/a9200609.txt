Abstract    :
                   Fialkow will continue his study of several problems                       
              concerning systems of bounded linear operators on Hilbert space.               
              These problems concern the following topics: joint hyponormality               
              and related problems in the theory of moments; spectral theory of              
              elementary operators; and majorization, factorization and                      
              invertible factor theorems in C*-algebras.  One part of the                    
              research will concern structural models for subnormal, k-                      
              hyponormal, and weakly k-hyponormal operators, with an emphasis                
              on unilateral weighted shifts; this study will also concern                    
              multidimensional power moment problems.                                        
                   Operator theory is that part of mathematics that studies the              
              infinite dimensional generalizations of matrices.  In particular,              
              when restricted to finite dimensional subspaces, an operator has               
              the usual linear properties, and thus can be represented by a                  
              matrix.  The central problem in operator theory is to classify                 
              operators satisfying additional conditions given in terms of                   
              associated operators (e.g. the adjoint) or in terms of the                     
              underlying space.  Operator theory underlies much of mathematics,              
              and many of the applications of mathematics to other sciences.
