Abstract    :
              The PI proposes to involve a number of undergraduate students in               
              a summer internship program.  The fields of study are all thrust               
              areas within the Department of Physics at UAH, and include space               
              plasma physics, optics, and materials sceince.  The related                    
              topics are presented under the unified theme of "Space Physics                 
              and Instrumentation"; students will be involved in the study of                
              materials used in the construction of, and optical                             
              characteristics of, space instrumentation, as well as in the                   
              scientific return from such astronomical instruments.  The                     
              students, and their advising faculty, will meet regularly as a                 
              group to discuss progress.  The proposed topics constitute                     
              genuine research endeavors, yet can realistically be completed in              
              one summer.                                                                    
              Recruitment is primarily targeted at students outside the local                
              area, but within the Southeast region.  The students will have                 
              many opportunities to interact with scientists and facilities                  
              both in local industry and at the nearby NASA Marshall Space                   
              Flight Center.
