Abstract    :
                   Research in hadronic and electromagnetic nuclear physics                  
              will be carried out.  Most of the near term experimental                       
              effort will be directed towards LAMPF, Bates, and NIKHEF.                      
              Longer term CEBAF projects are under development.                              
              Polarization and other related techniques will be used to                      
              explore the quark substructure and fundamental form factors of                 
              the nucleon.  Experiments will be sensitive to the strange                     
              quark content of the nucleon through pion nucleon phase-                       
              shifts, to the electric form factor of the neutron, and to the                 
              flavor-singlet proton charge form factor.  Similar studies for                 
              neutrons will be carried out using few nucleon targets.  The                   
              nuclear structure of few-body and selected complex nuclei will                 
              be carried out, the latter with oriented, polarized targets.
