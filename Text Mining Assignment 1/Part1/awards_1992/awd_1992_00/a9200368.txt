Abstract    :
              This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project is             
              in the areas of chemistry and chemical engineering.  For a three-              
              year period beginning April 1992 eight (8) undergraduate students              
              will spend ten (10) weeks engaged in research in the chemical                  
              sciences, under the direction of various members of the faculty in             
              both the Chemistry and Chemical Engineering Departments.                       
                                                                                             
              The summer research experience will be in projects drawn from                  
              material science and in biotechnology.  Seminars, tours, and the               
              projects will allow the chemistry and chemical engineering students            
              to see how the two disciplines strongly overlap, and how they are              
              synergistic.
