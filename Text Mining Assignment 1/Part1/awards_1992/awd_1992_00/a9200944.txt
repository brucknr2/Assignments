Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Scientific findings are treated as more certain and less                  
              controversial as they migrate downstream, that is, as they are                 
              interpreted and applied by actors increasingly removed from the                
              author's specialty area.  Downstream actors can include the press              
              or the courts, who can present or apply originally tentative                   
              findings as though they were engraved in stone.  This process,                 
              however, can be retraced.  Broadly concerned with toxic health                 
              risks and more specifically focusing on two case studies--the                  
              controversies linking spermicides and birth defects and aspirin                
              and Reye's Syndrome--this doctoral dissertation project, will                  
              move "upstream," reconstructing authors' publication decisions.                
              Open-ended interviews with both case-study (7-10 principals for                
              each case) and main sample subjects (a snowball sample of 40                   
              epidemiologists who have published studies linking environmental               
              exposures with toxicity in humans) will elicit information about               
              the actors' non-cognitive interests (that is, the social,                      
              economic, and political stakes in the outcomes), considerations,               
              and contingencies that attend the decision to launch a new truth               
              claim through publication.  In addition, a multi-tiered discourse              
              and content analysis will explore responses of the courts, the                 
              press, and the scientific community in the two case studies.                   
                                                                                             
                   This project will contribute to the advancement of                        
              sociological knowledge about the social construction of                        
              scientific facts, external influences on adherence to the "norms               
              of science," and the responsibilities of scientists for others'                
              use of their work.  This project also will provide an excellent                
              opportunity for a promising young scholar to continue to develop               
              independent research skills.
