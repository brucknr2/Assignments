Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to the Northeast Missouri State                      
              University (NMSU) Science Division to establish an NSF-REU program.            
              During the summer of 1992 eight undergraduate students will be                 
              given financial support to allow them to participate in an                     
              intensive, full-time research experience.   As demonstration of its            
              strong commitment to undergraduate research, NMSU will provide a               
              number of commitments, including:  clerical support, free on-campus            
              room and board and a waiver of tuition and fees for 3 college                  
              credits to student participants.                                               
                                                                                             
              Students, 4 from NMSU and 4 from off-campus, and faculty mentors               
              will form a research team, focusing on the study of a single                   
              system:  grass/fungi endosymbioses.  Students will be selected                 
              based on their research potential and capability, their                        
              independence and motivation, and their professional goals.                     
              Discussions between student and mentor will form the basis for                 
              matching students to specific research areas.  Students will work              
              in research areas that range widely from chemical analysis of                  
              fungal alkaloids, to ecological implications for grasses of                    
              harboring a fungus, to effects of fungal alkaloids on insect and               
              mammalian consumers of the fungus.  The central focus will                     
              integrate study at different levels of biological organization and             
              will help foster unity and community among group members.  The                 
              program includes several opportunities for students to communicate             
              about their work, including a required oral presentation of their              
              findings, and is aimed to develop project ownership by the student.
