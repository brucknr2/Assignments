Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to the Department of Biology at Wake                 
              Forest University to establish a Research Experiences for                      
              Undergraduates SITE.  The program will be a 10 week research                   
              experience in which the interests of the students will be matched              
              with those of appropriate faculty advisers in the Department.  In              
              conjunction with the research program, the students will be exposed            
              to a wide range of research expertise through weekly seminars and              
              two, overnight field trips.  Additional time will be spent in                  
              learning elementary statistics, experimental design, slide                     
              preparation, etc.  During the last two weeks of the research                   
              period, the students will be joined by their Mentors from the home             
              institution.  In this way, the students can share their research               
              experiences with faculty with who they will spend the majority of              
              their remaining academic career.  These faculty members will be                
              able to gain first-hand knowledge of the student's research and,               
              hopefully, sustain the research momentum during the following                  
              academic year(s).  The summer's research activities will culminate             
              in an all day colloquium at which time the students will formally              
              present the results of their work.  In order to encourage and                  
              facilitate maximum student-student interaction, they will be                   
              quartered in one of the University's residential houses throughout             
              the summer.
