Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to the Worcester Foundation for                      
              Experimental Biology to continue a successful Research Experiences             
              for Undergraduates Site.  The program consists of an intensive                 
              "hands-on" laboratory research experience individualized for each              
              student and performed under the guidance of working scientists                 
              expert in many of the traditional and modern areas of biological               
              sciences.  The program is designed to provide students with their              
              first exposure to the actual practice of scientific research in the            
              hopes that the excitement, challenge and creativity of the                     
              enterprise will convince them to consider basic research in the                
              sciences as a viable career choice.  In the spring, each student is            
              matched with a basic research project initially proposed by a                  
              preceptor with an active research program in the students stated               
              area of interest.  Upon acceptance, each student is provided with              
              a reading list of current publications in the selected area to                 
              provide the background required for the proposed summer research               
              project.  During the program students are   1) acquainted with                 
              current issues in biological research; 2) provided with the                    
              opportunity to learn and practice valuable scientific techniques               
              and skills, many of which can be utilized in future endeavors; 3)              
              guided in shaping the specific research questions to be asked in               
              each project; 4) required to work independently toward these                   
              research goals; 5) encouraged in cross disciplinary approaches to              
              their projects by providing opportunities for interaction with                 
              other students and the whole of the research staff at the                      
              Foundation; and 6) provided an educational setting which is                    
              maximally challenging and thus, fosters exploration of future                  
              career choices in science.  In addition to the required written                
              report detailing the progress made in their individual research                
              projects, each student presents a short oral report to the faculty             
              and public summarizing of the results of their efforts at a closing
