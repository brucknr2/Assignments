Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project involves a cultural anthropologist from the                       
              University of Michigan-Dearborn in the compilation of a data base              
              of Native American knowledge of plants as food.  The list will                 
              probably include in excess of 20,000 uses of at least 2000                     
              different species of plants, and will be of substantial value in               
              itself.  The data base will be analyzed in terms of its                        
              relationship to the entire flora of North America (some 20,00                  
              species) and to the medicinal flora of the continent About 2100                
              species) to see what these different floras share and how they                 
              differ.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              This project is significant because it will make readily                       
              available the collected wisdom of generations of Native American               
              people to both specialists and citizens.  Second, it will                      
              contribute to our understanding of how human beings construct                  
              their knowledge of the world, and by comparison with the                       
              medicinal flora, how people distinguish plants that heals and                  
              nourish us from those that can harm us.
