Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a Phase II project under the Small Business Innovation                 
              Research Program.  It addresses an understanding of the                        
              factors controlling the morphology, capacitance, and                           
              resistance of ionomer-coated, carbon-supported, highly                         
              dispersed particles of ruthenium oxide.  In Phase I, the use                   
              of this system for high-capacitance electrical storage systems                 
              was demonstrated.  The present effort aims to increase the                     
              energy density by controlling the dispersions and ionomer                      
              coating of the particulates.  The goal is a capacitance of 3                   
              farads per square centimeter.                                                  
                                                                                             
              High-energy density electrochemical capacitors are attractive                  
              for many applications including backup power for electronic                    
              memories (they are smaller and have longer lifetimes than                      
              rechargeable batteries.), electric vehicles (in conjunction                    
              with batteries; batteries do better at delivering constant                     
              power, but capacitors are much better at delivering bursts of                  
              high power on demand, such as for starting.),                                  
              electromechanical actuators (for robotic and space systems),                   
              and other high power short-pulse situations including laser                    
              weapons.
