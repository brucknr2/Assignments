Abstract    :
                   Support for three undergraduate researchers will be provided              
              by this award.  The students will work with the principal                      
              investigator on selected questions in applied mathematics taken                
              from problems arising in industrial settings.  Typical of these                
              questions are studies of light loss in space telescope metering,               
              modeling clocks in space and analyzing relativistic effects of                 
              light paths.  Some of the work will involve numerical                          
              approximations.                                                                
                   Visits to industrial research facilities are also planned.
