Abstract    :
                   This research is concerned with monoids of Lie type.  The                 
              principal investigator will study the relation between the                     
              coefficients of the unity of Solomon's Hecke algebra and the                   
              Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials; universal monoids of various types;               
              and finite-regular monoids associated with complex                             
              representations of groups of Lie type.                                         
                   The algebra M of nxn matrices over a field is of fundamental              
              importance in many branches of science.  As an algebra, M is                   
              indecomposable.  However, as a multiplicative monoid, M                        
              decomposes into n-1 local semigroups.  Putting together these and              
              similar local semigroups yields a monoid of Lie type which can be              
              thought of as deformations of M.  This research will use these                 
              monoids of Lie type to examine M.
