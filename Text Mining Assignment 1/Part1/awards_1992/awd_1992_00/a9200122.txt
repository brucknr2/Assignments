Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The project is directed at the properties of weak-coupling effects             
              in superconductors, with emphasis on two-dimensional (2D)                      
              superconductivity, vortex pinning and dynamics, and chaos.  Two                
              categories of experiments are planned: a) measurement of the                   
              dynamical properties of superconducting arrays of Josephson and                
              proximity-effect junctions;  b) measurement of vortex and flux-                
              pinning effects in 2D granular indium/indium oxide super-                      
              conductors.
