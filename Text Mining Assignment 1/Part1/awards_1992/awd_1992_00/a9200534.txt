Abstract    :
                   The overall goal of the research is to use observationally-               
              based data to better understand and predict hydrological and                   
              dynamical processes over the western Pacific Ocean and their                   
              interactions with adjacent areas.  The main objective will be to               
              prepare an atlas containing monthly means of several kinematic,                
              thermodynamic, and hydrological variables over the tropical Indian             
              and Pacific Oceans with an emphasis on the TOGA-COARE region.  The             
              atlas will use ECMWF analyses from the WCRP/TOGA archive II data               
              set for 1985-1990, and should be completed shortly after the end of            
              the intense observing period (IOP) of TOGA COARE.  In subsequent               
              years, a second atlas will be completed to include TOGA-COARE                  
              results for comparison.  Other specific objectives are:  to                    
              diagnose the horizontal and vertical structure of the intraseasonal            
              oscillation as it traverses the Large-Scale Array (LSA) of TOGA-               
              COARE; to investigate the relationship between enhanced tropical               
              heating in the LSA and subtropical wind maxima over the western                
              Pacific; and to examine a new method for improving estimates of                
              heat and moisture transfer coefficients with the intent of                     
              improving estimates of sensible heat exchange and evaporation over             
              tropical oceans.                                                               
                   The research is important because it is one of the TOGA COARE             
              studies to investigate the principal processes responsible for the             
              coupling of the ocean and the atmosphere in an especially climate              
              sensitive region of the world, the western Pacific Ocean, the field            
              site of TOGA COARE.
