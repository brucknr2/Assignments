Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to the Department of Biological Sciences             
              at the University of Wisconsin, Parkside to continue a successful              
              Research Experiences for Undergraduate SITE in southeast Wisconsin.            
              Eight highly qualified undergraduates will be recruited to conduct             
              research, at the Biomedical Research Institute laboratories on the             
              campus of the University of Wisconsin-Parkside in Kenosha.  Based              
              upon extensive experiences with undergraduate research together                
              with active research programs, faculty representing the focus of               
              Molecular and Regulatory Biology will serve as potential project               
              supervisors.  This program is deigned to develop each participant's            
              intellectual confidence, technical competence and research                     
              independence via:  1) guidance and daily nurturing by active                   
              researchers in the areas of Molecular and Regulatory Biology, 2) a             
              program of specific goals for each student's research progress via             
              a meeting and seminar schedule plus instruction in literature                  
              search and seminar presentation techniques complementary to each               
              project, 3) leveraging of the NSF effort through a commitment to               
              support additional students each summer and/or to carry over                   
              meritorious students for a second summer of research using internal            
              funding, 4) Aggressive regional and in some cases national                     
              recruitment of superior candidates with special efforts to attract             
              underrepresented groups plus housing arrangements proximate to the             
              UW-P laboratories, and 5) immediate and long-term evaluation of the            
              NSF-REU experience.
