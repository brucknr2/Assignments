Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The demographic and social relevance of young adult                       
              contraceptive use and fertility in developing countries is clear,              
              yet most research attention in this area has been focused on                   
              advanced-industrial societies.  This doctoral dissertation project             
              will investigate sexual and reproductive transitions among 15-24               
              year-old women in 21 African and Latin American countries for which            
              Demographic and Health Survey data are currently available.  The               
              patterns of sexual activity, contraceptive use, and fertility will             
              be documented, and analyses of their determinants will be performed            
              an an individual micro-level and at a cross-national, multilevel,              
              which will test hypotheses regarding how the micro-level effects               
              are attenuated, magnified, or reversed depending on nation-state               
              and ethnic group contexts.                                                     
                                                                                             
                   This project will contribute to our understanding of intra-               
              national as well as of cross-national differences in sexual and                
              reproductive transitions.  It also will provide an excellent                   
              opportunity for a promising young scholar to continue to develop               
              independent research skills.
