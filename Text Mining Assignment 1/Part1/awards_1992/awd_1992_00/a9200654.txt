Abstract    :
                   This project is to bring ten students, in each of two                     
              successive summers, to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln                      
              campus to work in digital image processing and computer                        
              vision.  Projects that will be part of the program include                     
              the following; image restoration and automatic target                          
              recognition, image restoration and infrared imaging system                     
              design, adaptive image restoration of satellite data, digital                  
              archive of the Mari Sandoz collection, image analysis of                       
              irrigation systems, human face recognition, and                                
              classification based on physical features.  The program                        
              involves instruction, research, and enrichment activities.
