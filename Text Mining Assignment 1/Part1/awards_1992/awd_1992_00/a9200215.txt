Abstract    :
              This REU Site is established at the Fluid Dynamics Research Center             
              (FDRC) of the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) in Chicago.               
              The program is directed at qualified undergraduate students                    
              enrolled at IIT  as well as at other universities and colleges in              
              the State of Illinois.  It is designed to provide the students with            
              hands-on experience in fluid mechanics research in an environment              
              where they will be exposed to new and exciting research problems.              
              A REU participant is a member of a research team, interacting with             
              the faculty as well as with other students.  He/she will be given              
              specific assignments tailored to obtain the right mix of knowledge,            
              the acquisition of new skills, and a sense of accomplishment and               
              belonging.
