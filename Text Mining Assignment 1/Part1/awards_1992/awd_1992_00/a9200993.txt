Abstract    :
              The purpose of this research is to study the temperature field                 
              around a rapidly propagating crack tip in metals.  Because of the              
              high rate effects occurring in rapidly propagating cracks, the                 
              classical Fourier heat conduction formulation is replaced by the               
              so-called thermal wave theory, in which there is a finite                      
              propagation speed for heat conduction.  The heat generation rate               
              in the local area surrounding the moving crack tip is modelled by              
              the rate of dynamic plastic work, using several different                      
              constitutive relations for the metal, each of which takes into                 
              account rate-sensitivity.  Predictions based on this theory will               
              be compared to available experimental results in order to establish            
              whether it is important to utilize thermal wave theory to                      
              accurately predict crack propagation phenomena in metals, and to               
              determine the appropriateness of the different constitutive                    
              relations employed in this study.
