Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site Award at the            
              University of Southern Mississippi.  The funds provide support for             
              ten undergraduate students selected from candidates who have                   
              completed three years from colleges in the Southeastern United                 
              States as well as Indiana, Illinois, Texas, Washington, and                    
              Wisconsin.  Participation includes a summer session and the                    
              following academic year.  Special emphasis is placed upon                      
              recruitment from under-represented groups such as females and                  
              minorities.  Students having three years in the physical sciences              
              are considered.  Scholastic achievement is the primary requirement             
              for participation in the program, with consideration given for                 
              prior research experience, and recommendation by a faculty member.             
              Scholastic courses on polymer science and laboratory safety are                
              required during a ten week summer session.  The research under                 
              supervision of faculty members will involve topics in the areas of             
              ionomer coatings and composite membranes, crystallization kinetics             
              of semicrystalline ionomers, nylon copolymers, graft polymers, and             
              polyelectrolyte/surfactant coacervates, and bioabsorable composite             
              materials.  The professors involved in this program have a strong              
              record of interaction with undergraduate students in research.
