Abstract    :
              The deterioration of the nation's water distribution systems is                
              of vital concern to all communities.  This project will develop a              
              model to assist decision-makers in their efforts to determine                  
              repair, retrofit or replacement activities.  The model will                    
              include the effects of pressure at various points and the effect               
              of valves and pumps in the total system.
