Abstract    :
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work                 
              of Professor Harry M. Walborsky at Florida State University.                   
              The chiroptical properties of acyclic 1,3-dienes will be                       
              studied.  A general method for the preparation of chiral                       
              atropisomers of acyclic 1,3-dienes will be devised which                       
              utilizes as a key step a cyclopropyl carbinyl rearrangement.                   
              The relative and absolute configurations of the chiral                         
              1,3-dienes as well as their chiral precursors will be                          
              determined and correlations with various sector rules will be                  
              attempted.  The rates and activation energies for the thermal                  
              racemizations of the dienes will also be established.                          
              %%%                                                                            
              Compounds which exist as nonsuperimposable mirror images by                    
              virtue of hindered rotation about a single bond between two                    
              carbon atoms will be examined.  A new method for constructing                  
              these molecules will be developed.  The three dimensional                      
              arrangement of the atoms will be determined and the rate at                    
              which the two mirror images interconvert will be determined.
