Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports the activities of a Research Experiences for               
              Undergraduates (REU) site in Flagstaff, Arizona, which will enable             
              eight to ten undergraduate students selected in a national                     
              competition to do astronomical research under the mentorship of                
              professional scientists.  The research activities will take place              
              in Flagstaff during the summer months.  Under the direction of Dr.             
              Kathleen DeGioia Eastwood, the principal investigator, several                 
              organizations will be involved in this REU site:  Northern Arizona             
              University (NAU), the Lowell Observatory, the astrogeology branch              
              of the U.S. Geological Survey, and the Flagstaff station of the                
              U.S. Naval Observatory.  Flagstaff is particularly well-suited as              
              an REU site since it is also the home of the National Undergraduate            
              Research Observatory (NURO), a nation-wide consortium of                       
              undergraduate schools dedicated to undergraduate research.                     
              Supplementing their research, students will also attend two lecture            
              series related to the science and techniques of astronomy, for                 
              which they will receive university credit.                                     
                                                                                             
              REU sites such as the one planned in Flagstaff are important in                
              increasing the technical and scientific skills of the Nation's most            
              talented and motivated undergraduates, and in enabling those                   
              students to experience state-of-the-art scientific research before             
              they make their final career decisions.
