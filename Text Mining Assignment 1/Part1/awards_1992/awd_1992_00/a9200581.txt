Abstract    :
              Adams         Recent research has revealed that the minimax and least-  squares
              optimality criteria are inappropriate for many digital  signal processing
              applications.  Minimax and least-squares  optimization problems are subsets of
              a more general (and much  more important) class of problems which are referred
              to as peak-  constrained least-squares (PCLS) optimization problems.  PCLS 
              solutions are needed for many digital signal processing  applications, but PCLS
              research is still in its infancy.         The objective of this research is to
              develop new concepts in  digital signal processing that are based on PCLS
              optimization.   Techniques from the theory of mathematical programming are
              being  used as the basis for this research.  Three categories of design 
              algorithms are being developed:  1.     new multiple exchange algorithms;  2.  
                extensions of conventional quadratic programming algorithms;  and  3.    
              extensions of Lawson's algorithm.
