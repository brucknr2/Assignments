Abstract    :
                   The Leguminosae (legume or bean family) is the third largest              
              family of flowering plants, and includes many species of economic              
              and scientific importance (beans, pea, soybean, etc).  Study of                
              the systematics, ecology, and other aspects of biology in this                 
              family has been enhanced and facilitated by the existence of an                
              international group of multidisciplinary workers, who have shared              
              their diverse interests and expertise in a series of                           
              international conferences.  The Third International Legume                     
              Conference (LC-3), "Evolution of the Leguminosae", is to be held               
              at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, England, from July 12-17,                   
              1992.  This project requests funding to assist speakers, poster                
              presenters, and other participants in ILC-3 from the United                    
              States to attend the Conference.  Priority in funding is to be                 
              given to younger researchers who might otherwise be unable to                  
              attend this valuable meeting.
