Abstract    :
                   This project will bring ten students to the San Diego                     
              Supercomputer Center (SDSC) for a ten week period in the                       
              summer of 1992.  Students, from all areas of science and                       
              engineering that rely on computing, will be teamed with                        
              faculty advisors from their home institutions, and one or                      
              more of the SDSC staff advisors.  Students will work on a                      
              well defined research project in computational science for                     
              the period.  Included in the experience will be report                         
              seminars, a final mini-conference, and the preparation of a                    
              summary paper for the experience.
