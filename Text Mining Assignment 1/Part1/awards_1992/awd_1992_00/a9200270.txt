Abstract    :
              This project will investigate the design of efficient dynamic data             
              structures for geometric problems.  Three classes of problems will be          
              considered:  point location in a dynamic planar subdivision, dynamic           
              intersection searching for a generalized class of intersection                 
              problems, and maintenance of functions defined on dynamic sets of              
              geometric objects.  These problems arise in diverse applications such          
              as, for instance, facilities location, VLSI, and clustering.  Both             
              theoretical issues (i.e., design of asymptotically-efficient schemes)          
              and practical issues (i.e., design, implementation, and evaluation of          
              simple schemes) will be addressed.  The methods to be employed                 
              include a combination of advanced data structuring techniques,                 
              geometric properties, and approximation.  It is anticipated that this          
              research will yield improved dynamic solutions for a variety of point          
              location problems as well as efficient dynamic solutions for the other         
              two classes of problems which have for the most part eluded efficient          
              dynamization.
