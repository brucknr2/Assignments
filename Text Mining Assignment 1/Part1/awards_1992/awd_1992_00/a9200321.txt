Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to the Division of Medical Sciences at               
              Harvard University to establish a Research Experiences for                     
              undergraduates SITE.  The Division supervises Ph.D. training                   
              programs of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences for students              
              engaged in biological research in laboratories on the Medical                  
              School campus.  This program is for a 10 week summer research                  
              experience for 9 undergraduate students who would work in the field            
              of microbial biochemistry and genetic regulation.  A research-                 
              related course, a student-faculty research seminar series, and a               
              career development discussion series will accompany the laboratory             
              research.  Students, who will be recruited from a nation-wide pool             
              with a particular emphasis on recruiting qualified minority                    
              students and women, will have the opportunity to carry out projects            
              in the laboratories of any of 13 Division faculty who are                      
              participating in this program.  The undergraduate will also be                 
              provided with opportunities to meet other majority and minority                
              research faculty and graduate students.
