Abstract    :
                   This award supports research in geometric group theory.                   
              The central theme is to consider a finitely generated group as                 
              a geometric object through its Cayley graph.  The principal                    
              investigator will study (bi)-automatic groups and (bi)-combable                
              groups; isodiametric and isoperimetric inequalities; and free                  
              group automorphisms.                                                           
                   A group is an algebraic object having a multiplication                    
              defined on it.   Groups can have an infinite number of elements                
              or a finite number of elements.  In the case of infinite groups,               
              they are often studied by associating with them finite objects of              
              some type.  In the case of this award, the central theme has been              
              to consider a finitely generated group as a geometric object                   
              through its Cayley graph.  This work has connections to several                
              areas of mathematics, as well as computer science.
