Abstract    :
              This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project is             
              in the field of chemistry.  For a one-year period beginning in                 
              April 1992, eight (8) undergraduates students will spend ten (10)              
              weeks engaged in research, under the direction of seven (7) members            
              of the chemistry faculty.  At least six of the 8 REU Program                   
              participants will be chosen from a pool of applicants who attend               
              institutions other than Trinity University, and every attempt will             
              be made to bring four students from underrepresented minorities                
              into this program each year.  The research programs in which these             
              students will be engaged are designed to offer them operational                
              knowledge of modern chemical instrumentation, opportunities for                
              contributions to publishable research, and experiences in effective            
              communication of their results.  As a result of their experiences,             
              REU student participants will understand in greater depth the                  
              wealth of choices available to them in the chemical profession, and            
              they will have an increased orientation toward further education in            
              the chemical sciences.
