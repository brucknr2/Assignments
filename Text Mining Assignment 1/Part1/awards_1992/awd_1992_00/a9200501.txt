Abstract    :
              This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project                
              is in the area of materials chemistry.  For three summers                      
              beginning in 1992, 16 undergraduate students will spend 10                     
              weeks engaged in materials chemistry research, under the                       
              direction of 11 senior faculty members from both Syracuse                      
              University and SUNY at Potsdam.  Four very closely related                     
              areas of chemical research in materials science will be                        
              investigated.  The first aspect involves the design, synthesis                 
              and characterization of new organometallic compounds with                      
              enhanced properties for use in thin-film depositional                          
              techniques such as organometallic vapor phase epitaxial (OMVPE)                
              and molecular beam epitaxial (MBE) processes.  The second                      
              aspect is the preparation and characterization of new materials                
              from the organometallic precursor compounds described above.                   
              The third aspect involves the study of the physico-chemical                    
              properties of these new materials.  The final aspect deals with                
              the chemical applications of these new materials to a variety                  
              of problems.
