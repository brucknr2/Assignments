Abstract    :
              This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project                
              is in the area of chemistry.  For three summers beginning in                   
              1992, eight undergraduate students will spend ten weeks engaged                
              in research in the chemical sciences.  Students in the program                 
              will begin research during the summer after their sophomore                    
              year.  A key feature of the program is the provision for the                   
              student to spend the summer after their junior year as a                       
              salaried research associate in the laboratory of an industrial                 
              sponsor.
