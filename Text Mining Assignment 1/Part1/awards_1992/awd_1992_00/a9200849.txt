Abstract    :
                   The field of dynamical systems studies qualitative and                    
              measure theoretic properties of systems that evolve in time,                   
              including iterated mappings, ordinary differential equations, and              
              partial differential equations.  Various ideas in dynamical                    
              systems, such as bifurcation, chaos, and strange attractors, have              
              applications in a variety of scientific areas.                                 
                   This project will support the 1992 Southeast Dynamical                    
              Systems Conference to be held from April 3-5, 1992 at North                    
              Carolina State University.  In the southeast, there are active                 
              dynamical systems groups at about a dozen universities and for                 
              the past three years the Southeast Dynamical Systems Conference                
              has promoted exchanges of ideas among these groups.  The                       
              conference will include nine invited lectures and will promote                 
              interaction among senior researchers and recent doctoral                       
              recipients and graduate students.
