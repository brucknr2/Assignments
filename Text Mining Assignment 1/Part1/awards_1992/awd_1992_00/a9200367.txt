Abstract    :
                   This award is to support a Research Experience for                        
              Undergraduate Site.  The participants will be students from                    
              the South at primarily undergraduate schools.  The students                    
              will participate in research projects at the University of                     
              Alabama.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              The research projects cover a spectrum of computer science                     
              activities including object based modeling, scheduling                         
              algorithms, graphical user interfaces, parallel algorithm                      
              simulation, fourth generation programming languages, data                      
              base research, neural nets, and testing of Ada program                         
              components.
