Abstract    :
                   This research employs analytical methods and numerical                    
              simulations to investigate (in the context of relativistic                     
              astrophysics) the accretion processes around a black hole                      
              immersed in an external magnetic field.  The black hole's                      
              exterior spacetime is modelled by a solution of the combined                   
              Einstein-Maxwell equations (the magnetized Schwarzschild                       
              metric).                                                                       
                   Equipotential surfaces and Von Zeipel cylinders of                        
              relativistic rotating thick disks are analytically                             
              investigated.  Computer algebra systems will be used to tackle                 
              some of the cumbersome calculations expected in this part of                   
              the project.  A numerical approach is also needed in regions                   
              where the analytical method fails (outside the closed                          
              potentials).  This numerical approach involves converting the                  
              relativistic hydrodynamic equations into finite difference                     
              schemes to be solved on a supercomputer.  Image processing                     
              techniques and color images will be necessary to interpret the                 
              numerical output.                                                              
                   One important aim of the project is to involve                            
              undergraduate science majors in research experiences.  This                    
              project will provide talented students with the opportunity                    
              for planning, carrying out, and reporting scientific research.                 
              Moreover, by using advanced computational tools, they will                     
              develop computing skills needed for their future advancement                   
              in science or engineering.
