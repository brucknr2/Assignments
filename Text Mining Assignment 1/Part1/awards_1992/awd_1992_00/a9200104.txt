Abstract    :
                   Professor Carlsten and his group study soliton formation in               
              stimulated Raman scattering.  Solitons are pulses that propagate               
              through a medium without changing shape, even when they undergo                
              collisions.  They were first observed in barge canals in the 19th              
              century as water waves that mysteriously refused to dissipate.                 
              Carlsten's group investigates solitons in electromagnetic waves                
              where they are of great importance to wave propagation in optical              
              fibers.
