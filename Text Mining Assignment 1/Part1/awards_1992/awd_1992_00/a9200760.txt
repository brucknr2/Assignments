Abstract    :
                   This project supports a biological survey of the dynastine                
              scarab beetles of Costa Rica and Panama.  Dynastines are                       
              prominent elements of the entomofauna as a result of their rich                
              diversity, numbers and, in some instances, their size and body                 
              form; these are the rhinoceros or unicorn beetles of the tropics.              
              The subfamily Dynastinae in Costa Rica and Panama consists of 32               
              genera and approximately 161 species with new species awaiting                 
              description.                                                                   
                   The objectives of the project are to (1) study the                        
              Dynastinae already residing in research collections in Costa                   
              Rica, Panama, and North America, (2) collect intensively in                    
              numerous localities and different seasons in Costa Rica and                    
              Panama (primarily at light traps, flight intercept traps and in                
              rotting logs), (3) assemble and deposit authoritatively                        
              identified collections in Costa Rica, Panama, and the United                   
              States, (4) make available to others duplicate specimens, and (5)              
              publish a monographic survey of this group as it exists in Costa               
              Rica and Panama.  Included in the monograph will be bilingual                  
              identification keys to all taxa, descriptions of all taxa,                     
              geographic and temporal distributions, ecological and life                     
              history data, biogeographical data, and numerous illustrations.                
                   The project is significant because it will provide the first              
              extensive documentation on all aspects of these beetles as they                
              occur in Central America.  This kind of detailed treatment of                  
              Dynastinae has never been done for any mainland country in Latin               
              America.  The study will also provide a sound taxonomic basis for              
              all future studies on these beetles.  Future studies dealing with              
              biogeography, phylogenetic inferences, and ecological                          
              relationships can only be accomplished with the kind of data                   
              gathered in this proposed survey.
