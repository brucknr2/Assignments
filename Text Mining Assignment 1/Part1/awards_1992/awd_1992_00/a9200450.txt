Abstract    :
                   The Physics Department at Rensselaer will carry out a REU                 
              Site Program for 10 weeks to be held in each summer from 1992 to               
              94.  The aim of the REU projects is to involve 10                              
              undergraduate students, four from Rensselaer and the rest from                 
              other institutions in the Northeast and the Atlanta University                 
              Center to participate in frontier physics research under the                   
              supervision of experienced faculty members.  The available                     
              projects cover a variety of topics including Astrophysics;                     
              Biophysics; Condensed Matter Physics; Optical Physics;                         
              Innovative Undergraduate Education; Nuclear Physics.  A plan to                
              recruit minority and women students into the program is included.              
              The majority of the students will be recruited from outside                    
              Rensselaer.
