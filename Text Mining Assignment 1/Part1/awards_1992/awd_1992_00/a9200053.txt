Abstract    :
                   The principal goal of the Summer Undergraduate Research                   
              Program in Nuclear Physics at the Indiana University Cyclotron                 
              Facility is to provide promising undergraduate physics majors                  
              with a meaningful, exiting and challenging experience in                       
              scientific research.  Fifteen students per year will be                        
              involved in experimental and theoretical research projects at                  
              IUCF and the Nuclear Theory Center for 10-week summer terms in                 
              the 3-year period 1992-94.  The students will be recruited                     
              from colleges and institutions throughout the U.S., with                       
              preference to institutions within the Midwest as well as small                 
              institutions where research opportunities for undergraduates                   
              may be limited.  It is expected that 90% of the students will                  
              come from institutions other than Indiana University at                        
              Bloomington, and that at least 25% of the students will be                     
              women.  The participants will gain direct research experience                  
              by working on projects in nuclear physics, nuclear chemistry                   
              and accelerator physics, under the supervision of faculty                      
              members and senior scientific staff.  Special programs for the                 
              students will be arranged, including orientation sessions,                     
              weekly seminars on current research in physics, and a machine                  
              shop mini-course.  At the end of the summer term, the students                 
              will submit research papers based on their work, and present                   
              the results in seminars at a closing symposium.
