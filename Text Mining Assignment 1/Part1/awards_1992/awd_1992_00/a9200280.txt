Abstract    :
              A variety of superlattices, multilayers and metastable solids will             
              be fabricated primarily by multi-source advanced sputter                       
              deposition, and characteized by x-ray diffraction, transmission                
              electron microscopy and other techniques.  The superlattices and               
              multilayers are designed to reveal finite-size effects and                     
              dimensional crossover in magnetic and superconducting systems with             
              various correlation lengths.  The realization and the origin of                
              magnetic surface anisotropy will be investigated.  Paticular                   
              attention will be paid toward perpendicular magnetization and its              
              probable connection with magnetostriction.  In                                 
              superconductor/magnetic multilayers, experiments are proposed to               
              investigate the relationship between the effects on                            
              superconductivity and the magnetic ordering and conductivity of the            
              magnetic layers.  A number of metastable solid systems will be                 
              studied in order to reveal new properties in structures                        
              unattainable by conventional methods.
