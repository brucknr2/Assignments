Abstract    :
                   This program will bring ten undergraduate students to                     
              Hunter College of CUNY in the summer of 1992, to be followed                   
              up with a once weekly academic year experience which will be                   
              a continuation of the work begun in the summer.  The students                  
              will all be from underrepresented groups, and will be                          
              students at Hunter or one of the smaller private colleges in                   
              the area.  In addition to the coverage of research topics,                     
              the participants will be provided with the opportunity to                      
              visit several industrial sites during the program, and will                    
              be presented with materials dealing with ethical issues in                     
              computer science and engineering.  The research topics                         
              include problems about the existence of projective planes,                     
              about the existence of symmetric balanced incomplete block                     
              designs, and about the existence of perfect error correcting                   
              codes.
