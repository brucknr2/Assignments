              Site proposal to provide research experiences for selected                     
              undergraduates in marine sciences, with specific emphasis on                   
              geochemical and ecological studies, to acquaint them with the                  
              excitement and opportunities of academic research and to encourage             
              them to pursue graduates studies and a career in ocean sciences.
