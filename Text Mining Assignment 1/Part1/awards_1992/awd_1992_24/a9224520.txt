                                  9224520 Milchberg The generation of coherent vacuum
              ultraviolet and soft X ray radiation by the nonlinear interaction of intense
              picosecond and subpicosecond pulses with moderate density rare gases is an area
              of great practical and fundamental interest.  We propose experiments to address
              a number of questions that have arisen in the field and to proceed from the
              answers to the development of more efficient sources of coherent, soft X ray
              radiation.  (i) The effect of shifting of atomic resonances by an intense laser
              field on the high harmonic generation efficiency will be investigated using a
              two color experiment: a longer (100 ps), infrared pulse to shift the levels,
              and a variably delayed subpicosecond visible pulse to generate harmonics. (ii)
              The role played by ions in generating harmonics will be determined using both
              one and two color pump probe techniques.  (iii) High precision spectroscopy of
              the high harmonics (generated with both long and short pulses) will be
              performed with a 6.7 m VUV spectrometer.  (iv) Multiwave mixing involving two
              driving wavelengths will be studied to achieve efficient phase matching and
              near resonant conditions.  This is expected to dramatically increase the
              efficiency of short wavelength generation.  (v) Our recently achieved success
              in optical guiding of intense short laser pulses will also be exploited to
              determine the effect of guiding structures on harmonic generation efficiency.
