Abstract    :
              9224283  Knight         The proposed UNIX computing system will provide enhanced
               capabilities for meteorological research and classroom teaching.   To provide
              students with an up-to-date education and expose them to  state-of-the-art
              research facilities, the PIs propose to provide  experience in using UNIX
              systems for atmospheric research.  ***
