Abstract    :
              This U.S.-Bulgaria research project between Dr. Stuart Pittel,                 
              Dr. Jonathan Engel, Mr. Roland Larsson, of the Bartol Research                 
              Institute, and Dr. Peter Raichev, Dr. Roussy Roussev, Dr. Ana                  
              Georgieva, Dr. Mario Stoitsov, Dr. Lilia Mariova, Dr. Borislav                 
              Slavov, Dr. Vessilin Dimitrov, Tsetsa Dankova, Nikolai Minkov, of              
              the Bulgarian Institute for Nuclear Research & Energy (INRNE) and              
              Sofia University in Bulgaria, will focus on "Contemporary Issues               
              in Nuclear Structure Theory."  The researchers will (1) develop                
              mapping methods to use in quark descriptions of finite nuclei;                 
              and (2) use some new many-body methods developed in Sofia to                   
              study galactic dark matter detection by 73Ge.  Access to the                   
              Bulgarians' new approach to odd-mass nuclei should prove useful                
              in future studies.  Understanding the dark matter in galaxies and              
              in the universe as a whole represents one of the greatest                      
              challenges facing contemporary physics.  An enormous experimental              
              effort is underway to search for galactic dark matter with                     
              terrestrial detectors and in particular with a 73Ge detector.

              This project in theoretical physics fulfills the program                       
              objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading                
              experts in Bulgaria and the United States to combine                           
              complementary talents and pool resources in areas of strong                    
              mutual interest and competence.
