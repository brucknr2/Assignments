Abstract    :
                   Theoretical studies of carbon and metallic clusters using                 
              techniques from condensed matter and nuclear physics are used                  
              to elucidate the electronic, magnetic and structural                           
              properties of a variety of interesting systems.  These include                 
              fullerenes as well as alkali metal clusters.  Techniques used                  
              include LCAO, LDA and Greens function methods.  Particular                     
              attention is paid to collective effects, the effect of                         
              substitution in metal alloy systems, spectroscopic properties                  
              such as the Jahn-Teller effect and the relationship of                         
              structure to magnetic properties.
