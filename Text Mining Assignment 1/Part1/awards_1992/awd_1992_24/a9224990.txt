Abstract    :
                   This research will study two different classes of problems                
              for Markov processes. The first is a study of the asymptotic                   
              distribution of certain generalized occupation time formulas for               
              special classes of Markov processes.  The investigator has                     
              recently obtained generalized arcsine laws for occupation times                
              of one dimensional Levy processes in joint work with M.J.Sharpe.               
              He will attempt to find higher dimensional analogues of these                  
              results.  The second class of problems deals with the potential                
              theory of a general Markov process. In a recent monograph the                  
              principal investigator has shown that for many purposes excessive              
              measures are more fundamental than excessive functions. He plans               
              to continue his investigation of the potential theory of                       
              excessive measures. In particular the connection with capicitary               
              measures and excursion theory.                                                 
                   This research is in the area of Markov processes. A Markov                
              process is a mathematical model of how certain random phenomena                
              evolve in time. Examples are the diffusion of a gas or liquid, or              
              the motion of a collidal particle in a liquid subject to                       
              molecular bombardment. This last example is called Brownian                    
              motion. Surprisingly the mathematical model for Brownian motion                
              also turns out to be of fundamental importance in potential                    
              theory which encompasses electrostatic potentials and equilibrium              
              temperature distributions in solids among other things.
