Abstract    :
              This is the first year of a three-year continuing award.  The                  
              research addresses the next generation of model-based vision                   
              systems, which should demonstrate the recognition in monocular                 
              image data of complex curved objects selected from a large database            
              of models.  This will require major progress in the areas of shape             
              representation, modeling, and matching. This research focuses on a             
              novel shape representation and its application to automatic model              
              construction from sets of range and video images and to object                 
              recognition, including aspect graph construction, pose computation,            
              and indexing into a database of models.  In this research,                     
              arbitrary smooth 3D shapes are represented by a  set of                        
              characteristic surface curves having the properties that they                  
              determine the structure of the image contours and its catastrophic             
              changes, and there is a natural correspondence between some of                 
              these curves and monocular contour features such as inflections and            
              bitangents.
