Abstract    :
              Murdocca         In this project a system is being built to translate a 
              dataflow language into hardware and implement the hardware on an  optical gate
              array.  The system is comprised of three components:   a compiler to translate
              a dataflow language such as ID into a  dataflow graph; a method for converting
              dataflow graphs into  hardware described by a hardware description language,
              along with  a simulator; and a synthesis program for mapping HDL descriptions 
              onto an optical gate array.  The optical gate array consists of  planes of
              electronic gates, with the planes interconnected by  free-space optics.  An
              advantage of this kind of gate array is  quick reconfiguration of the optical
              interconnections which  allows dataflow graphs to be changed quickly.        
              This project is applicable to the development of advanced  integrated
              engineering cells for manufacturing.  Because of noise  immunity and lack of
              electromagnetic interference, optical  computation is well-suited to the
              factory floor.  Reconfigurable  optical computers of the type under development
              in this project  may allow high-speed computation to be inserted into 
              manufacturing processes in new ways.
