Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Technical Narrative:                                                           
                                                                                             
              These US-Turkey scientific visits involve                                      
              researchers from the University of New Orleans                                 
              (UNO) and Middle East Technical University                                     
              (METU) in Ankara, Turkey.  The first visit                                     
              entails a two-person team from UNO travelling                                  
              to METU in order to complete the first phase of                                
              a joint research project in the area of pulse                                  
              width modulation (PWM) for electric power                                      
              rectifiers.  The primary objective of this                                     
              visit is to use METU laboratory facilities to                                  
              test the efficacy of PWN rectificiation in                                     
              eliminating power system harmonics.  A second                                  
              visit involves a METU researcher travelling to                                 
              UNO.  These two visits will result in the                                      
              development of a large-scale, cooperative                                      
              research proposal on PWM involving UNO and METU                                
              faculty researchers; these two universities                                    
              anticipate signing a formal inter-University                                   
              researcher exchange agreement.                                                 
                                                                                             
              This cooperative science activity in electrical                                
              engineering fulfills the program objective of                                  
              advancing scientific knowledge by enabling                                     
              leading experts in the United States and Turkey                                
              to combine complementary talents and pool                                      
              research resources in areas of strong mutual                                   
              interest and competence.
