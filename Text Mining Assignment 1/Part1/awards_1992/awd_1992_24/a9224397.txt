Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In avian cooperative breeding systems, one or more nonbreeding                 
              individuals help the breeding pair to rear their young.  In the                
              Florida scrub jay, most of these nonbreeding individuals help by               
              feeding nestlings and fledglings.  The doctoral-dissertation                   
              research of Mr. Stephen Schoech will examine the hormonal                      
              mechanisms underlying the delay of breeding and the provisioning               
              of non-descendant young.                                                       
                                                                                             
              Mr. Schoech will compare the hormonal profiles of breeders and                 
              nonbreeders throughout the breeding season.  Additional                        
              comparison between nonbreeders of different ages and relatedness               
              to breeders will illuminate the importance of these factors.  Mr.              
              Schoech will also examine the importance of body condition and                 
              the availability of potential mates, and will manipulate hormone               
              levels experimentally by giving individuals hormone implants.                  
                                                                                             
              The combination of correlational and experimental methods should               
              greatly augment our understanding of how seemingly mature                      
              individuals delay breeding and exhibit isolated parent-like                    
              behaviors.
