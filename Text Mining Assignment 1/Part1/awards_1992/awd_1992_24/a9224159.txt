Abstract    :
              This pilot project will develop and test one interactive                       
              multimedia courseware module on social, ethical, and professional              
              issues that arise from computing technology, and develop detailed              
              plans for two other modules.  The first module will highlight the              
              history of computer ethics, consider how the meaning of the term               
              has changed over the last two decades and compare this field with              
              other branches of applied ethics, explore important concepts such              
              as privacy and responsibility, and include scenarios that add                  
              interest and reality to the concepts.  The two planned stacks                  
              will focus on issues of professional responsibility, and issues                
              of access and equity for persons with disabilities.  Multimedia                
              "HyperCard stacks" combine video clips, sound bites, graphics and              
              text.  The first stack will be tested by classroom teachers and                
              by students in interactive independent study.  It will be                      
              disseminated at cost to universities and scholars that request                 
              it; and demonstrations will be presented at national conferences               
              and workshops.  The stack will serve as a prototype for high                   
              quality, cost effective, state-of-the-art curriculum materials on              
              computing and human values.
