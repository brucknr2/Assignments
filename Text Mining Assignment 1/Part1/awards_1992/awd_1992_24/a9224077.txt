Abstract    :
              9224077  Ong    This award is to start a new Materials Research Group (MRG) at
              Princeton University on the subject of electronic transport in non-fermi-liquid
              materials.  The long-term objective of the research at the MRG is the discovery
              and elucidation of guiding principles for a set of unconventional behavior seen
              in a variety of materials, which lie outside the purview of standard
              one-electron band theory as well as the equally standard perturbative 
              many-body "Fermi liquid" theory.  The research is aimed at addressing
              fundamental problems in materials with reduced dimensionality and strong
              electron interaction effects.  The program emphasizes the experimental and
              concurrent theoretical investigation of three classes of materials -
              semiconductor heterostructures (gallium arsenide/gallium aluminum arsenide
              quantum wires), cuprate high temperature superconductors, and organic
              conductors (Bechgaard salts).  Materials synthesis for all three systems, as
              well as electrical and thermal transport measurements, down to millikelvin
              temperatures, and high magnetic fields, are being done at Princeton University.
               Collaborations with industrial institutions such as AT&T Bell Laboratories,
              Exxon Research Corporation and NEC Research Institute are ongoing.     The
              research being done is relevant to understanding the fundamental physics
              underlying materials with ultra small dimensions, which lie at the heart of the
              electronics and optoelectronics industry, in addition to high temperature
              superconductivity technology.  The institution has made a strong long-term
              commitment to research and education in materials science and technol ogy.  The
              institutional environment is excellent for training of advanced students in
              these fields of science and engineering.  ***   v       s  t  PLICATGRP
