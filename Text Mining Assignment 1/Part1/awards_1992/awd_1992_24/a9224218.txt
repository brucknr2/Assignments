              The Moss Landing Marine Laboratory (MLML) requests funding to                  
              purchase shipboard instrumentation in support of NSF-funded                    
              research.  The Instruments will be used aboard the R/V POINT SUR,              
              a 135 foot vessel, which is owned by NSF and operated by the                   
              University. The PI requested funding to purchased a rosette system             
              and controller, a multiple corer Niskin bottles, and a shipboard               
              computer. The instrumentation was requested to provide adequate                
              support for NSF-funded scientific research.
