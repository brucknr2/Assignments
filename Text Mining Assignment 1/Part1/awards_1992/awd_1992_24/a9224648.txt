Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to analyze three broad issues:                  
              machine replacement and aggregate business fluctuations, team                  
              dynamics, and business cycle behavior.  The first topic involves               
              the aggregate implication of machine replacement which entails                 
              the replacement of old machines with new, more productive ones.                
              Previous work has focused on seasonal fluctuations induced by                  
              retooling in the automobile industry during the both interwar and              
              post WW II periods.  The extensions will involve looking more                  
              broadly over other industries to focus on the connection between               
              machine replacement and the business cycle and to evaluate                     
              competing theoretical models of seasonal productivity                          
              fluctuations.  The second topic concerns the relationship between              
              complementarities in the production process and the distribution               
              of income.  Here the assignment of individuals to teams (e.g.                  
              firms) is analyzed focusing on the induced dynamics of the income              
              distribution, paying particular attention to persistent income                 
              inequality.  The third topic continues previous work on net                    
              business formation, bank runs, and the importance of                           
              technological non-convexities for aggregate fluctuations.  This                
              research is important because it will provide a better                         
              understanding of factors influencing economic fluctuations and                 
              the distribution of income.
