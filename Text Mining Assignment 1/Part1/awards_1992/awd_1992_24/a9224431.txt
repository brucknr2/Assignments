Abstract    :
              9224434  Raitsimring  Funding is requested to build a modern pulsed EPR
              accessory for an existing new Bruker ESP 300E spectrometer, that will operate
              at X- and P-band and to develop new pulse trains for investigation of weak
              interactions between magnetic centers.  This research equipment will be used
              for several projects, including development of new pulse trains of electron
              spin echo allowing the selection of different kinds of electron-electron and
              electron-nuclear interactions' investigation of the question of g-strain and
              unresolved nitrogen hyperfine structures of model heme complexes; investigation
              of interprotein complex formation between cytochromes b, and c;  determination 
              of the rates of rotation of dioxygen in mixed metal cobalt-substituted
              hemoglobins; investigation of the structure of the molybdenum and heme centers
              of sulfite oxidase and model molybedenum (V) complexes; measurement of the
              rates of photochemically initiated redox reactions between metallproteins or a
              metalloprotein and a flavin; investigation of the intimate surroundings of the
              heme centers in cytochromes C2 and the iron-sulfur centers in HIPIPs; and
              measurement of the distances between paramagnetic centers in multiheme and
              heme-flavin containing proteins.  6 7 8 9 : ;   =       A B C   E F G H I J K L
