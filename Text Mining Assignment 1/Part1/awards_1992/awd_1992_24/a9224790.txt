Abstract    :
                   This RUI award covers experimental Elementary Particle                    
              Physics research by a group at the University of Massachusetts                 
              Dartmouth in collaboration with other NSF and DOE supported                    
              scientists.  The group will continue its participation in the                  
              EVA collaboration at Brookhaven National Laboratory.  They                     
              will probe the experiment evidence for nuclear transparency, a                 
              prediction of the quantum chromodynamic theory of nuclear                      
              forces.
