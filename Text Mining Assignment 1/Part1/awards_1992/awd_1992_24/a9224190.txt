Abstract    :
              9224190  Onstott  This project will use Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data
              obtained  from the European Space Agency Earth Resources Satellite (ERS-1) to 
              investigate the distribution of sea ice characteristics and  thickness in the
              Chukchi Sea region north of Bering Strait.    Satellite observation will be
              compared to in situ measurements and  SAR signatures obtained from an
              instrument on board the USCGC Polar  Star, and extended to observations made
              farther east in the  Beaufort Sea during the LEADEX experiment of 1992.    The
              distribution of sea ice characteristics and thickness is  believed to be a
              significant indicator of climate change in polar  regions.  At this time our
              understanding of the processes that  determine these factors, and our
              capability of determining the  variability of sea ice on even the regional
              scale is inadequate.   Consequently the proper interpretation of satellite
              microwave  images appears to be potentially the most productive way to address 
              questions of global change in polar regions.  Since ERS-1 is the  first of
              several satellites to carry an active microwave radar,  research in this area
              is particularly timely.  ***
