Abstract    :
                   This REU site award provides support for ten undergraduate                
              researchers working under the supervision of several faculty                   
              advisors.  The program runs for eight weeks as a combination of                
              individualized research projects, usually one student with one                 
              researcher and short courses on material not normally found in                 
              the undergraduate curriculum.  A faculty seminar with talks on                 
              research interests is scheduled to broaden student perspectives.               
              A strong cooperative effort with the Mathematical Sciences                     
              Section of Oak Ridge National Laboratory includes some teaching                
              of the short courses and the direction of student projects by                  
              mathematical researchers at the laboratory.                                    
                   Research projects will cover areas such as applying optimal               
              control to population models with particular applications to                   
              competitive systems, predator-prey models and bioremediation                   
              strategies.  Other work will focus on the application of                       
              statistical decision theory to analyze alternative partitioning                
              patterns of limited nutrients to root and shoot tissue, on the                 
              size of minimal generating sets for finitely generated ideals of               
              commutative rings and development of numerical algorithms which                
              operate with some type of parallelism.
