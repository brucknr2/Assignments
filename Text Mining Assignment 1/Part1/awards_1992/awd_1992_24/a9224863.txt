Abstract    :
                   The research team of Arakawa and Mechoso represents a highly              
              successful and productive collaboration which has made many                    
              contributions to the advancement of numerical modeling of the                  
              atmosphere over the years.  Under this award, they will continue               
              their research, focusing on three topics:  (1) the physical and                
              conceptual basis for cumulus cloud parameterization in global                  
              models and the development of a cloud model for use in that                    
              parameterization, with special attention to role of the cloud's                
              "environment", both above and below;  (2)  mathematical                        
              formulations for moisture advection in their hybrid sigma-theta                
              coordinate model of grid-scale hydrological processes, and (3) the             
              effects of subgrid-scale variations of model lower boundary                    
              conditions involving both orographic and non-orographic gravity                
              waves and variations in the thermodynamic properties of the                    
              surface.  Advances in all of these areas will improve the                      
              performance of atmospheric models for research and forecasting                 
              purposes.
