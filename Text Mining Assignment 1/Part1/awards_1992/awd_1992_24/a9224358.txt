Abstract    :
                   This award supports six projects in invariant theory and                  
              representation theory.  Four of these projects are focussed on                 
              questions in invariant theory, related to the dual pairs and the               
              "method of multiplicity-free actions".  They all are concerned                 
              with extending the range of examples in which one can effectively              
              compute quantities of interest.  Specifically, they are concerned              
              with tensor products, weight spaces, plethysms, counting lattice               
              points in certain polyhedra, generalized spherical harmonics, and              
              multiplicity-one phenomena in restrictions of representations.                 
              A fifth project concerns the computation of explicit structure of              
              principal series representations of real reductive groups.  A                  
              sixth project involves the study of structure in congruence Hecke              
              algebras on p-adic groups and its implications for the existence               
              of minimal K-types in p-adic representation theory.                            
                   The research support concerns the representation theory of                
              finite groups.  A group is an algebraic object used to study                   
              transformations.  Because of this, group are a fundamental tool                
              in physics, chemistry and computer science as well as                          
              mathematics.  Representation theory is an important method foe                 
              determining the structure of groups.
