Abstract    :
              9224628  Young  Microscopy using extreme ultraviolet and soft x-ray radiation
              offers high resolution, high contrast, and chemical sensitivity.  Holographic
              imaging, now possible because of advances in short wavelength lasers, is unique
              in its potential to achieve true wavelength-limited resolution because it
              eliminates optical elements and their imperfections.  In addition, holography
              records valuable phase and depth information.  This program focuses on
              developing imaging techniques that can achieve wavelength-limited resolution
              regardless of the illuminationg wavelength.  Such flexibility will enable
              application to many problems using a variety of sources, and the imaging
              capabilities will advance along with new short wavelength source developments. 
              The scientific information necessary for imaging at wavelenths shorter than
              about 200m, and particularly for developing a holographic microscope, will be
              pursued in a three phase research program.  First, laser-produced plasma
              sources and lasers will be used to measure the optical properties of recording
              films and typical object materials in the 200nm to 30nm region, where little
              information is currently available.  This information is required to guide the
              development of new films, to choose optimum illuminating wavelenghts, and to
              interpret images.  Next, techniques for high resolution contact microscopy will
              be developed, using the new films and atomic force microscope readout.  Images
              of test objects at various wavelenghts will be used to asses and verify film
              performance and image interpretation algorithms.  Contact microscopy is a
              proven high resolution technique,  and it will be extended to imaging real
              objects.  Finallly, with this background, the problems of reading high
              resolution holograms and numerically reconstructing faithful images will be
              investigated.  ***   v       s  t                  _ 0   , ,              c
