Abstract    :
              9224575  Brown  This is a collaborative research on verified hardware synthesis 
              between Cornell University and Oxford University.  The projects  at Cornell and
              at Oxford are aimed at synthesizing correct  hardware.  These projects each use
              different (though related)  languages and different target architectures.  By
              combining  expertise of the two groups a set of tools and methodologies will 
              be developed which allows the designer a great deal of  flexibility.  The
              primary tasks of the project are:    Sharing Tools  The main benefit will be to
              share tools so that  each group can take advantage of developments from other 
              projects.    Development of Common Intermediate Form  In order to facilitate 
              sharing of tools a common intermediate form will be developed.    Comparison of
              Verification Techniques  Both groups are working on  proofs of correctness for
              their compilers and the languages being  studied are quite similar.  However,
              the proof techniques being  used are substantially different.    Comparison of
              Target Implementations  The two groups have access  to different sets of target
              hardware.    Development for Different Applications  While the compilation 
              systems developed are similar the target applications are  different.  ***
