Abstract    :
              In Phase II we propose a revolutionary surface-                                
              emitting /receiving optical head.  Building on our                             
              successful Phase I results, we will develop                                    
              transceiver array optical heads comprising one- and                            
              two- dimensional arrays of thousands of high-speed,                            
              densely-packed addressable vertical cavity surface-                            
              emitting lasers and photoreceivers integrated to                               
              microlenses.  This new critical technology promises                            
              to displace conventional optical heads containing                              
              single edge-emitting lasers which are currently used                           
              in compact disc players, laser print engines and                               
              local area network fiber optic communications.                                 
              Future credit card-size optical memory technology                              
              comprising our transceiver array optical heads may                             
              well be the next dominant trend in digital storage.                            
              The biggest fallout of this new critical technology                            
              may be its replacement of CD, cassette tape, digital                           
              audio and video tape and laser discs.  The new                                 
              technology also promises to be the digital laser                               
              printhead of the future for high-speed, high-                                  
              resolution computer-to-plate sheet-fed presses and                             
              for electrographic and photographic digital laser                              
              printing & copying.                                                            
              In addition, this critical technology will impact                              
              numerous parallel optical processing applications                              
              including:  free-space optical interconnects, digital                          
              optical computing, neural optical computing and                                
              pattern recognition through, e.g. dramatic                                     
              simplification of the interconnection optics.
