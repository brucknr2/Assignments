               This research project addresses the reinforcement of soil  excavations to
              resist earthquake shaking through the use of  soil nailing.  Soil nailing is an
              insitu soil reinforcement  technique that has been tested and implemented
              during the  past twenty years in a variety of civil engineering  applications. 
              The fundamental concept consists of placing  in the ground passive inclusions
              (steel reinforcing bars) as  the excavation proceeds, in order to restrain
              displacements,  limit decompression during and after the excavation, and to 
              form a nailed mass that can behave similarly to a soft  retaining wall.   
              Post-earthquake field investigations and laboratory studies  have shown that
              soil-nailed structures are highly resistant  to earthquake loading.  However,
              to date, only limited  studies have been conducted to evaluate their response
              and  possible failure mechanisms under seismic loading.  Such  research is
              needed to develop reliable design methodologies.  Given the increasing
              popularity of soil nailing, this  research project will have considerable
              impact on the  geotechnical design and construction industries.    This project
              involves numerical analyses, laboratory  experiments -- in which a geotechnical
              centrifuge is used to  subject small-scale models to horizontal shaking -- and
              post-  earthquake observations.  This integrated approach provides  a thorough
              understanding of the seismic response of soil-  nailed systems, and will result
              in specific engineering  guidelines for their seismic design.    This is a
              collaborative project involving the University of  California at Los Angeles
              and the Polytechnic University,  New York, with the experiments being performed
              on the  geotechnical centrifuge at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
