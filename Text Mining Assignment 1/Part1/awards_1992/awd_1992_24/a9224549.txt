Abstract    :
              9224549  Seyler  Three separate, but related topics will be investigated
              concerned  with small and intermediate scale phenomena of the magnetosphere- 
              ionosphere system and the role that they play in mediating the  coupling,
              energetics and dynamics of the auroral zone.  The first  topic is an
              exploration of the small and intermediate scale  structure of auroral arcs
              using a three-dimensional simulation  model that has been refined over the past
              four years.  The second  subject is concerned with the auroral acceleration of
              electrons  through wave processes, including Alfven wave acceleration and 
              acceleration through the parametric decay of auroral kilometric  radiation
              (AKR).  Recent sounding rocket observations (TOPAZ I, II  and III) have found
              tranverse ion acceleration events associated  with intense lower-hybrid wave
              packets.  The third topic of inquiry  will explore the characteristics of
              lower-hybrid wave phenomena in  the upper auroral ionosphere.  We presently
              have at our disposal  three-dimensional nonlinear simulation models for
              lower-hybrid  waves which we will use to compare to sounding rocket
              observations  as well as to test the theories of lower-hybrid collapse and the 
              associated transverse ion acceleration.  ***
