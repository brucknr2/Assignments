Abstract    :
              This grant is for the partial support of an international (IUTAM)              
              symposium on computational mechanics of materials to be held                   
              during June 15-18, 1993 at Brown University, Providence Rhode                  
              Island, U.S.A.  The symposium will allow the presentation of                   
              state-of-the-art research findings in the area of computational                
              mechanics of materials to the most outstanding and active workers              
              in that emerging field from academe, government laboratories and               
              industry.  This field differs in scope from other branches of                  
              computational mechanics by placing a heavy emphasis on                         
              micromechanics and material characterization and design.  It also              
              utilizes methodologies not employed in other segments of                       
              computational mechanics.
