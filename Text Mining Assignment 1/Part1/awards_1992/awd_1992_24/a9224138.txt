Abstract    :
              9224138  Bander    This three-year award supports U.S.-Sweden cooperative
              research  in theoretical particle physics between Myron Bander of the 
              University of California at Irvine and Hector Rubinstein of the  University of
              Uppsala in Sweden.  The objective of their research  is to study hadronic
              phenomena in the presence of very large  magnetic fields.  These fields may be
              connected to astrophysical  phenomena such as superconducting cosmic strings
              and are  associated with the early universe.    Previous collaborative efforts
              examined instabilities, proton  decay in large magnetic fields, and the
              screening of fields by  chiral symmetry breaking.  The investigators propose to
              extend  their collaboration to a study of quark spectroscopy in the  presence
              of intense magnetic fields and explore the cosmological  consequences of large
              magnetic fields. They hypothesize that  large magnetic fields may occur in the
              early universe.  Their  presence could explain how the early universe evolved.
              The  proposed collaboration takes advantage of complementary expertise  and
              will advance fundamental understanding of quantum cosmology  and particle
              physics.  ***
