Abstract    :
                  Cedarbaum  9224797    This U.S.-Argentina Cooperative Science Program award 
              supports travel expenses of A. Cederbaum, Mount Sinai School  of Medicine, New
              York to Argentina.  Dr. Cederbaum will  carry out research in biochemistry, in
              collaboration with S.  Puntarulo and A. Boveris, of the Univ. of Buenos Aires. 
              The  award also covers disposable supplies needed for the  research and some
              publication costs.    The research id directed towards understanding the role
              of  transition metals in catalyzing the production of active  oxygen radicals
              by biological systems, in particular the  ferritin system.   The physiological
              role of ferritin is  important, and the approach taken by the investigators is 
              likely to solve some long-standing problems involving the  action of ferritin.
