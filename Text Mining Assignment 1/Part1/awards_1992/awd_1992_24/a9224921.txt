Abstract    :
              This project is an examination of the geochemistry of naturally                
              occurring trace elements in the Arctic Ocean.  The primary trace               
              element is aluminum, but measurements of iron, beryllium, and                  
              selenium will also be made.  The objective is to determine the                 
              magnitude, variability, and source of aluminum enrichment of the               
              shelf brines in the Barents, Kara, and Laptev Seas, and to use                 
              these results to infer hydrographic processes of the eastern Arctic            
              Ocean.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              The Norwegian and Greenland Seas have a dissolved aluminum                     
              concentration that is considerably higher than expected from the               
              exchange of water masses, pointing to a regional external source of            
              aluminum.  While the normal pathways are the dissolution of                    
              aluminum carried through the atmosphere and deposited at the                   
              surface, and through river discharge, an additional arctic pathway             
              is by fractionation in the freezing process.  That is, sea ice is              
              depleted and the resulting brine is enriched in aluminum.                      
                                                                                             
              The measurements will be made on a Summer 1993 cruise of the German            
              polar research vessel POLARSTERN as part of a wide-ranging physical            
              and chemical observing program.  An exceptional framework of                   
              hydrographic data will be available for the interpretation and                 
              analysis of these geochemical measurements.
