Abstract    :
              The objective of this Workshop is to promote intra- and inter-                 
              national interaction between the academic, governmental, and                   
              industrial segments of the U.S. and Brazilian geotechnical                     
              communities. It is expected that this interaction will lead to                 
              the definition of common grounds concerning outstanding                        
              geotechnical problems and of probable research avenues toward                  
              their solution. For obvious geological reasons it is expected                  
              that a particular type of structured soils- residual soils- will               
              be major (but not necessarily exclusive) common ground of the                  
              Workshop.
