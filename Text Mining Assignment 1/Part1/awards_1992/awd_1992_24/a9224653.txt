Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Solid State Sciences Committee (SSSC) of the National Academy              
              of Sciences, working with the National Materials Advisory Board                
              (NMAB) will hold the next SSSC Forum in May 1993.  The theme of                
              the Forum is the Advanced Materials and Processing Program (AMPP)              
              developed by the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP)                
              to implement the recommendations of the report Materials Science               
              and Engineering for the 1990s.  The Forum program will focus on                
              the restructuring of materials science and engineering in the                  
              United States from research to manufacturing.  Discussion topics               
              will include the relationship between materials science and other              
              federal initiatives, such as Grand Challenges in computing;                    
              federally funded industrial consortia, such as SEMATECH and CSE;               
              and the emerging role of government laboratories in technology                 
              transfer.  This award for partial support of the 1993 SSSC Forum               
              is under the direction of Ronald D. Taylor.
