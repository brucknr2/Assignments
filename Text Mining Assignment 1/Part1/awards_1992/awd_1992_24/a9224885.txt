Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will examine the relationship between mother's                    
              schooling and child rearing styles in Mitontic, a rapidly                      
              modernizing rural highland Maya community in Chiapas,                          
              Mexico.  In particular, researchers will examine the                           
              proposition that mother's schooling affects social identity,                   
              parental investment strategies, and conceptions of personal                    
              development and interpersonal relations creating great                         
              differences in the environments infants experience.  This                      
              project  will provide a detailed account of early individual                   
              development in a sample of 25 Mayan infants and explore                        
              their mother's child care style as a function of                               
              sociocultural conditions (especially mother's schooling and                    
              cultural conceptions of child rearing) and a child's                           
              individual characteristics (e.g., gender, health, and birth                    
              order).  In addition to intensive ethnographic research on                     
              child rearing practices in Mitontic, mother-infant                             
              interaction will be videotaped on a bimonthly schedule and                     
              biweekly interviews with the mothers will be conducted from                    
              birth onwards in a longitudinal study of the first two years                   
              of life.
