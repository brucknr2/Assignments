Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Oregon State University (OSU) requests funding to purchase                     
              shipboard instrumentation in support of NSF-funded research.  The              
              instruments will be used aboard the research vessel WECOMA, a 177              
              foot vessel that is owned by NSF and operated by OSU.  All of the              
              instruments are for shared-use by a wide variety of scientists.                
              The PI will upgrade the ship's computing, replace Niskin bottles,              
              and purchase a Milli-Q water purifier, a fluorometer, an AC bridge             
              standard for the temperature calibration facility, and a liquid                
              scintillation counter.
