Abstract    :
              Measurement of rare kaon decay modes will be carried out at                    
              Brookhaven National Lab to look for new physics beyond the                     
              standard model.  The group will develop the needed data                        
              acquisition system and Cherenkov detector.  In addition at                     
              Brookhaven, an experiment to search for the H-dibaryon, a six                  
              quark object predicted by theory, will be conducted.  Other kaon               
              and hyperon studies are being planned for CEBAF, and                           
              instrumentation required for this latter work is under                         
              development by the group.  The overall activities of the group                 
              relate to searches for physics beyond the standard model, and                  
              tests of the quark sub-structure of nucleons and hyperons.
