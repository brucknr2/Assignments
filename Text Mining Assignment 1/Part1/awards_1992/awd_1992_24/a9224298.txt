Abstract    :
                   The role of coherency strains in phase formation is examined              
              using sophisticated X-ray scattering techniques.  The initial                  
              stages of phase formation involve formation of locally ordered                 
              regions or clusters.  Coherency strains can affect the compositions            
              of these clusters and modify the phase diagram.  Lattice parameters            
              are measured in the nickel-vanadium alloy system to monitor matrix             
              composition and precipitate composition as a function of bulk                  
              composition and temperature.  Coherency strains are expected to                
              have a role in determining surface segregation.  Local order near              
              crystallographic surfaces is examined in copper-gold, Cu3Au, and               
              compared to the bulk.

                   This research provides greater understanding of the factors               
              that influence the surface and bulk microstructure and properties              
              of materials.
