              countries have an international reputation for developing advanced technologies
              which are both efficient and humane.  What are the mechanisms through they
              accomplish this?  In reality, how successful are policies which use government
              to influence technology?  This project aims to answer these questions through a
              comparative study of the national networks which foster new information
              technology in Norway and Sweden.  The comparison i s particularly timely
              because of recent government changes in Sweden.  The basic method will be
              anthropological fieldwork in Oslo, at the National Computing Centre, and in
              various sites in Stockholm.  Specific areas to be studied include policies to
              promote 1) broad participation in computing system design; 2) new technology
              for people with disabilities; and 3) computing which equalizes the social roles
              of women and men.  In addition to documenting one way in which systems get
              created, the project will help us understand both the limits and the advantages
              of including the public in decisions about new information technology.  ***   #
