Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This study investigates the nature of ecological                               
              interactions of two taxonomically disparate organisms                          
              sharing refuge habitats during early life history                              
              stages.  Laboratory and field experiments will examine                         
              interspecific processes of competition and predation                           
              and their interactions between populations of larval                           
              fish (Fundulus heteroclitus) and postlarval grass                              
              shrimp (Palaemonetes pugio) which co-occur on vegetated                        
              saltmarsh surfaces in shallow aquatic microhabitats.                           
              Both species exhibit rapid declines in numbers                                 
              following concurrent peak recruitment of juveniles onto                        
              intertidal marshes.  Density-dependent intraspecific                           
              and interspecific effects on survivorship and growth                           
              rates will be the focus of this research.                                      
                                                                                             
              Interspecific competition, resource depletion, and                             
              indirect effects on meiofauna will be examined in                              
              laboratory microcosms.  Field experiments using                                
              enclosures on the vegetated intertidal marsh will                              
              assess predation and interspecific competitive effects.                        
              Understanding biotic interactions in this system should                        
              contribute to a broader understanding and appreciation                         
              of the role of interspecific interactions on                                   
              recruitment variability affecting critical early life                          
              history stages of organisms.
