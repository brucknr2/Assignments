Abstract    :
                    This International Symposium on Nondestructive                           
              Characterization of Materials has been held in three different                 
              countries at intervals varying 3 to 1 years.  This 6th symposium               
              will be held in Oahu, Hawaii on June 7-11, 1993.  It has an                    
              International Organizing Committee of  13 members from 5 countries.            
              The complete program includes sessions on Electronic Component                 
              Nondestructive Characterization & Evaluation; Biomimetic and Biotic            
              Materials; Interfaces; Nondestructive Characterization for Process             
              Control; and Verification of Materials Processing Models.

                    This International Symposium on Nondestructive                           
              Characterization of Materials will be the sixth symposium, held in             
              three different countries at time intervals varying from one to                
              three years.  It provides a forum for active scientists and                    
              engineers to exchange the recent advances in their respective                  
              fields.  It is also a forum for the materials researchers and the              
              nondestructive testing researchers to exchange information and to              
              promote understandings.
