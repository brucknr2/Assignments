Abstract    :
                   Professor Raymer studies the quantum statistical properties               
              of light generated by "stimulated splitting" of photons in an                  
              intense laser pulse as it travels through a nonlinear optical                  
              crystal.  This light splitting technique is optical parametric                 
              amplification (OPA) and produces strongly correlated photon                    
              pairs.  The ability to measure photon-number distribution with                 
              high quantum efficiency makes possible a detailed                              
              characterization of nonclassical (inherently quantum mechanical)               
              effects.
