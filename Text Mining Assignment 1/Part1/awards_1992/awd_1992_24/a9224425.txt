Abstract    :
              9224425  Brand    This award supports a feasibility study to determine if a 
              reliable and practical method to cryopreserve algal strains can  be developed. 
              Specifically, Dr. Brand, in collaboration with Dr.  Diller and Dr. Starr will
              develop means to cryopreserve the  strains of algae in the University of Texas
              Culture Collection of  Algae.  Cryopreservation, if successful, will (1)
              stabilize and  protect the algal resources, (2) diminish the day-to-day cost of
               maintaining the collection, and (3) make storage and shipment  less expensive
              and more efficient.  Prokaryotic algae  (cyanobacteria) in general are amenable
              to storage under  conditions currently used to cryopreserve other bacteria. 
              Recent  advances in techniques for cryopreservation of other organisms 
              indicate that many of the eukaryotic algal strains will be  amenable to
              cryopreservation without a major experimental effort.  Protocols will be
              developed which permit cryopreserved cultures  to be thawed and grown in small
              batches, thus making these  generic resources available and useful for
              collections anywhere  in the world which maintain algal strains for research,
              teaching  and/or technology development.  ***
