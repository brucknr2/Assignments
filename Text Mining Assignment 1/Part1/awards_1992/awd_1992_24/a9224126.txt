Abstract    :
              On August 24, 1992, Hurricane Andrew severely damaged 70% of the               
              living collection of palms and cycads (about 41,000 accessions)                
              st the Fairchild Tropical Garden in Miami, Florida, the largest                
              tropical botanical garden in the continental US.  This project                 
              will provide emergency support to assess the damage and to                     
              collect and preserve specimens, including trunk wood of palms and              
              cycads.  These specimens would figure in research projects that                
              represent unique opportunities -- they would normally not be                   
              carried out as they involve destruction of rare or irreplaceable               
              specimens. Specimen collection must occur within the next two                  
              weeks before decay and dessication render the material                         
              unsuitable.
