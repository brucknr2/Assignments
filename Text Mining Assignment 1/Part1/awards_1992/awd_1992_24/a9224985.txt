Abstract    :
              The objective of the Undergraduate Internship Program in High-                 
              Performance Computing in Fluid Dynamics at the University of                   
              Minnesota is to promote and help support undergraduate involvement             
              in ongoing and new research on high-performance computing in fluid             
              dynamics, and in new software development efforts for scientific               
              computing and graphics support for such research.  The program                 
              provides a special opportunity for undergraduates to participate               
              in the research programs and enrich their experience.                          
              Undergraduates will work with faculty on a wide variety of projects            
              on high-performance computing in fluid dynamics.  Faculty from                 
              various disciplines have individually contributed projects on a                
              variety of closely related topics in fluid dynamics and will be                
              responsible for supervising undergraduate students.  The program               
              will be administered by the Minnesota Supercomputer Institute and              
              will be open to undergraduate student participants who are citizens            
              or permanent residents of the United States and its possessions.               
              The projects are unified by their common elements of high-                     
              performance computing and graphics development for the fluid                   
              dynamics applications.
