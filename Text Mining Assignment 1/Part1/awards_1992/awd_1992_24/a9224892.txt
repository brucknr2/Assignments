Abstract    :
              The Polar Research Center at the University of Washington will                 
              establish a science management office for the Oceans-Atmosphere Ice            
              Interactions (OAII) component of the Arctic Systems Science (ARCSS)            
              global change research program.  Initial science planning and                  
              management for this activity established initial plans and                     
              priorities for interdisciplinary ocean- and atmosphere-related                 
              Arctic research, and an ARCSS OAII Science Plan was developed.                 
                                                                                             
              The Science Management Office (SMO) will support the OAII science              
              steering committee and various working groups.  Based on community             
              input the steering committee formulates recommendations on research            
              priorities and assists in developing Announcements of Opportunity              
              for ARCSS research.  The steering committee also reviews and                   
              updates annually the OAII science plan and provides recommendations            
              to the funding agencies.  The SMO will organize and conduct                    
              workshops that bring together experts to further define and rank               
              scientific initiates and related activities.  It will also serve as            
              a point of contact for coordinating the diverse research activities            
              of OAII investigators.  Information will be disseminated from the              
              SMO through newsletters, electronic mail, and other means to keep              
              the community up to date on program activities, directions, and                
              opportunities.
