Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              PROGRAM:   Oceanographic Instrumentation                                       
                                                                                             
              The University of Delaware's College of Marine Studies (CMS)                   
              requests funding to purchase shipboard instrumentation in support              
              of NSF-funded research.  The instruments will be used aboard the               
              R/V CAPE HENLOPEN, a 120 foot vessel, which is owned and operated              
              by the University. The PI will purchase a shipboard copy machine,              
              Nisken bottles, a dissolved oxygen titration system, a box corer               
              and a solar radiation sensor. The instrumentation was requested to             
              provide adequate support for NSF-funded scientific research to be              
              conducted on the CAPE HENLOPEN during 1993.
