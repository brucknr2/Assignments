Abstract    :
                9224544  Maxion    This is the first year funding of a three-year continuing
              award.   Discovering functional relationships among high-dimensional data is 
              astonishingly hard.  Overcoming the "curse of dimensionality" is a  vital
              problem for any complex manufacturing industry, such as VLSI  production, in
              which hundreds of variables must be precisely  controlled in order to achieve
              high-quality yield.  This research  addresses both theoretical and practical
              concerns.  On the  theoretical end, statisticians have recently proposed a
              number of  compelling new ideas for high-dimensional, nonparametric regression 
              (e.g., ACE, AVAS, LOESS, PPR, MARS, RPR and several other  algorithms).  These
              ideas are largely untested, and little is known  about their comparative
              performance in realistic situations.  To  remedy this, a large-scale simulation
              experiment is performed that  employs statistical design to evaluate the
              effects of sample size,  dimensionality, signal-to-noise ratio, and various
              kinds of  underlying functions on the integrated mean squared error of the 
              fitted model.  The results of the study are examined in an analysis  of
              variance, leading to clear conclusions as to the circumstances  under which
              each of the proposed methods is most valuable.  On the  practical side, this
              research applies the methodology studied in  the simulation experiment to VLSI
              production data as micro-modeled  by the PREDITOR software, which is widely
              used in industry to  calculate from physical principles the actual result of
              each step  in the production of a VLSI circuit wafer.   ***
