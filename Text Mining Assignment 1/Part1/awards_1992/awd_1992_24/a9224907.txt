Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              For the past two decades, Stanford has conducted a highly                      
              successful summer workshop that has served as a gathering place for            
              extended research interactions among economic theorists.  The                  
              intellectual and physical environment, extended program format,                
              experienced staff, and support from the University and the Hoover              
              Institution have combined to make the Stanford program uniquely                
              successful over many years.  The program has traditionally provided            
              an important forum for younger economists to present and receive               
              comments on their work.                                                        
                                                                                             
              For the summer of 1993, a program with the following three themes              
              is proposed: Environmental Economics, Financial Institutions and               
              Imperfections, and Epistemic Foundations of Game Theory.  Each                 
              topic will be centered on a workshop and will also include a series            
              of presentations on the same theme.  For the subsequent summers,               
              topics to be concentrated on include: Implementation and Design of             
              Economic Mechanisms, Applications of Game Theory to Oligopoly, and             
              Discontinuous Changes Induced by Inflation.
