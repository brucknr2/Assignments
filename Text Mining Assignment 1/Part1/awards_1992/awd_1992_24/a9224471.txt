Abstract    :
              This award supports a multi-disciplinary study (sedimentology,                 
              paleontology, and oxygen-isotope stratigraphy) of glacial sediments            
              in the Kara and Barents Seas.  At present, melting of ice sheets               
              that are known to have existed cannot explain completely the well              
              documented post-glacial rise in sea-level.  An ice sheet in the                
              Kara and Barents Seas region could have contributed substantially              
              to post-glacial sea-level rise.  The goal of this study is to                  
              determine the extent of an ice sheet that is thought to have                   
              existed in this region during the last glacial maxima, the timing              
              of its disintegration or retreat, and its potential for                        
              contributing to post-glacial sea-level rise.
