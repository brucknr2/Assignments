Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The general problems presented by terrestrial environments are                 
              carried to extremes by subtropical deserts, which are notable for              
              their high temperatures and their capacity to desiccate organisms.             
              Traditional views suggest that small insectivorous birds encounter             
              little difficulty in maintaining water balance because of the high             
              fractional hydration of their prey.  There is remarkably little                
              direct evidence to support this view; water balance in small                   
              insectivorous birds exposed to environmental conditions normally               
              prevailing in subtropical deserts is essentially unknown.  Recent              
              analyses, however, suggest that even under cool conditions, small              
              birds may show either a water deficit or barely balance their water            
              budgets over the daily cycle.  This research focuses on (a) the                
              physiological and ecological bases of the suppression of vital                 
              activities by a very small, diurnal bird, the Verdin, during the               
              hottest portions of the summer day in the Sonoran Desert, and (b)              
              dissecting the physiological foundation for occupancy of this most             
              extreme terrestrial habitat by developing a complete water budget              
              for animals exposed to ecologically realistic conditions.  This                
              project will examine Verdin daily activity patterns, microclimate              
              selection, avenues and rates of water intake and loss, field                   
              metabolic rates, patterns of resource utilization and resource                 
              availability and abundance.
