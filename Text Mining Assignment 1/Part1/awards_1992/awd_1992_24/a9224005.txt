Abstract    :
              9224005  Meseguer  This research will extend the scope of declarative 
              programming to support reactive system applications (e.g.,  communications
              software, operating systems, robotics)  and  concurrent object-oriented
              systems.  The research will also  develop a unified logical framework as the
              semantics basis  for a multiparadigm declarative programming language  unifying
              functional, relational, and concurrent object-  oriented programming, and
              having powerful mechanisms for  programming-in-the-large.  The multiparadigm
              language will  be implemented by extending the current implementation of  the
              OBJ3 language which will be included as a functional sub  language.    The
              methods used to design the multiparadigm language are  based on an axiomatic
              theory of general logics that permits  combining logics supporting different
              styles of declarative  programming by means of mappings preserving the
              structure of  these logics. Examples of such mappings include sub logic 
              inclusions and translations between logics.    The results of this research
              will provide new methods for  specifying, programming and reasoning about
              reactive and  concurrent object-oriented systems at a high level of 
              abstraction, and for reusing such systems to increase  software productivity,
              as well as a language implementation  supporting these methods.  The results
              will also contribute  to the mathematical foundations of concurrent object- 
              oriented programming.  ***
