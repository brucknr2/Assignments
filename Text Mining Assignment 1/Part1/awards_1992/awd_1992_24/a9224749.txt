Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Reproductive isolation is important for the maintenance                        
              of species as distinct entities.  Since reproductive                           
              isolation is often predominantly maintained through                            
              behavioral traits, it can be affected by changes in                            
              courtship patterns.  The period (per) gene of                                  
              Drosophila, because it is species-specific and                                 
              regulates an aspect of courtship song, provides an                             
              opportunity to examine change in a courtship behavior,                         
              as related not only to reproductive isolation but also                         
              amino acid and nucleotide level changes.  An ideal                             
              group in which to study these relationships is                                 
              Drosophila willistoni and its sibling or closely                               
              related species.  The group exhibits different degrees                         
              of reproductive isolation among its species,                                   
              semispecies and subspecies.  Specifically the project                          
              will examine; 1) the molecular variation in per and                            
              behavioral variation in courtship song for several                             
              populations of D. willistoni; 2) the variation in the                          
              gene locus and in song for the D. willistoni sibling                           
              species; 3) if there is evidence for reproductive                              
              character displacement among populations of D.                                 
              paulistorum living together vs those living isolated                           
              from each other and 4) relationships of the sibling                            
              species as determined by the per sequence.  This                               
              project should help explain the relationships of                               
              genetic variation, behavioral change, and reproductive                         
              isolation in the formation of species.
