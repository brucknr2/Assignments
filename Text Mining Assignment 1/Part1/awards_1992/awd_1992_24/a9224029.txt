Abstract    :
              9224029  Stone  This award supports a multi-disciplinary study (seismology, 
              geochronology, and paleomagnetism) toward an understanding of the  present
              tectonics and recent tectonic history of the Sakha Republic  in Russia.  The
              goals are to determine the geometry of present  plate boundaries and to
              determine the geologic and tectonic  development of this part of northeastern
              Russia and it relationship  to the tectonic development of northwestern Alaska.
               Of particular  importance is the goal of distinguishing between tectonic
              models  which involve large scale relative motion between Alaska and the 
              Russian far-east.  This project is a collaborative venture between  the
              investigators from the United States and Russia.  ***
