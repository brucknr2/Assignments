Abstract    :
              9224553  Karimabadi  Of the six types of shocks (fast, slow, and four types of 
              intermediate shocks) allowed by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) Rankine-  Hugoniot
              relations, intermediate shocks are the least understood.   Besides being of
              great theoretical interest, the study of  intermediate shocks (ISs) is
              essential to the understanding of  diverse space plasma phenomena, such as the
              magnetopause and shock  fronts associated with coronal mass ejections.  ISs
              provide an  important dissipation process in space plasmas and are one of only 
              two plasma discontinuities that allow for the rotation of the  magnetic field,
              with the other being the rotational discontinuity  (RD).  Although the
              existence of ISs has recently been established  within the resistive MHD
              framework, far less is known about their  properties in collisionless plasmas. 
              This work is to investigate  the formation and properties of ISs and their
              relation to RDs in  collisionless plasmas with applications to space plasmas. 
              For the  first time many important effects, such as temperature anisotropy, 
              will be included in the calculations.  We will examine the  hypothesis that
              field rotations at the magnetopause and in the  solar wind are due to ISs
              rather than RDs.  Two approaches will be  taken.  One is the study of ISs as a
              single structure removed from  external perturbations.  The other approach
              involves the formation  of multiple discontinuities and their interactions,
              much as would  occur during reconnection events.  The goal of this study is to 
              determine the conditions under which ISs can be formed, and whether  they can
              remain stable in the presence of perturbations.  The  primary tools of our
              investigation are state-of-the-art kinetic  numerical simulations, although for
              comparison, MHD simulations  will also be performed.  ***
