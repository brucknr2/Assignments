Abstract    :
                   This research is on various mathematical problems arising in              
              the modeling and analysis of industrial processes, such as                     
              electrophotography, channel flow, film growth and oxidization of               
              alloys.  The mathematics of these problems involve nonstandard                 
              partial differential equations, free-boundary problems, fixed-                 
              points, a priori estimates, variational inequalities and their                 
              regularity properties.                                                         
                   The research in this direction will lead to a better                      
              understanding of the industrial mathematical models and provide                
              explanations and insight for the physical phenomena behind the                 
              models.
