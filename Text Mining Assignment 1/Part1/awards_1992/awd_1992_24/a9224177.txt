Abstract    :
              This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                  
              chemistry and in the subfield of fluorescence spectroscopy.                    
              During the tenure of this grant, Professor Warner and his students             
              will examine interactions between cyclodextrins and a series of                
              polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) using a suite of                       
              spectroscopic methods.

              This research will employ infrared spectroscopy, circular                      
              dichroism spectroscopy, x-ray crystallography, and fluorescence                
              spectroscopy to elucidate the molecular details of complexation                
              between cyclodextrins and PAHs together with the ternary effects               
              arising from the addition of alcohols to these systems.  These                 
              investigations continue work initiated by Professor Warner at                  
              Emory University under NSF grant CHE-9001412.  The results of this             
              research will be useful in the development of analytical methods               
              for naturally chiral compounds and for compounds with induced                  
              chirality.
