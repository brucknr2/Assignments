Abstract    :
              9224688  Mozer       This project examines the theory of 3He and heavy ion 
              acceleration in impulsive solar flares by modeling the effect of 
              electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves on the acceleration of  particles in the
              solar corona.  In this theory, electromagnetic  hydrogen cyclotron waves
              propagate into a larger magnetic field  where they become resonant with
              particles have the next largest  charge to mass ration after protons, namely
              3He.  The PI will  predict the energy spectra and abundances of these ions in
              order to  expose the theory to a rigorous test of its validity by future 
              measurements.  The PI will simulate the acceleration of ions by  following test
              particles in phase space and we will model the waves  by using a broadband wave
              spectrum composed of a superposition of  random plane waves whose electric and
              magnetic fields are related  by the appropriate dispersion relation.  The
              project will model the  distribution functions for comparison with those
              deduced from  gamma-ray observations of energetic particles in closed magnetic 
              flare loops.  They will study the growth and damping of these waves  for
              typical flare plasma parameters in the presence of an electron  beam in order
              to determine the parameters of flare plasmas which  are consistent with the
              waves.  ***
