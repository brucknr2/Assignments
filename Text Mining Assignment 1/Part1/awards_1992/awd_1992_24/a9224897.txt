Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This REU Site Award provides an opportunity for ten                            
              undergraduate students in science and engineering to conduct                   
              twelve weeks of independent research under the guidance of                     
              faculty in the NSF Science and Technology Center for High                      
              Performance Polymeric Adhesives and Composites at Virginia                     
              Tech.  The students will be doing research focusing on                         
              polymer synthesis, surface and interface science,                              
              fabrication and processing of composite and adhesive                           
              materials, testing and characterization of materials systems                   
              and final constituents, and computer modeling and simulation                   
              to understand and predict performance of advanced polymeric                    
              adhesives and composites.                                                      
              %%%                                                                            
              The interdisciplinary nature of this program provides a                        
              realistic exposure to large scale research on complex                          
              problems wherein many lines of attack involving different                      
              scientific and engineering disciplines must be brought to                      
              bear on key issues in order to make progress.  Students have                   
              an opportunity to work closely with faculty and other                          
              graduate students and to utilize state-of-the-art equipment                    
              and instrumentation in their work.  They also receive                          
              professional development training through technical                            
              presentations of their work at a technology symposium held                     
              at the end of the summer, and through preparation of a final                   
              written report.
