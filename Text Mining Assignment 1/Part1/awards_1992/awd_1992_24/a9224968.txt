Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal is for conference support for the forthcoming IAU                
              colloquium, " The Sun as a Variable Star: Solar and Stellar                    
              Irradiance Variations".  The conference will be to review toe most             
              recent results of the observations, theoretical interpretations,               
              and physical models of the variances observed in irradiances from              
              the Sun and stars. This proposal summarizes the scientific basis               
              for the colloquium and the major topics to be covered. The success             
              of the colloquium will depend, in large part, on the ability to                
              provide travel and subsistence support for invited speakers where              
              such support is needed for their active participation in the                   
              colloquium.
