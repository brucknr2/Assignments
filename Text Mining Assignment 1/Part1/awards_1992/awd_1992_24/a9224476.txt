Abstract    :
              This grant is in the area of analytical and surface chemistry                  
              and in the subfield of mass spectrometric studies of gas-phase                 
              metal ion cluster chemistry.  Professor Freiser and his                        
              students will use a supersonic source to generate metal ion                    
              clusters containing multiple metal atoms.  The source will be                  
              used in conjunction with Fourier transform mass spectrometry                   
              and laser photochemical techniques to investigate gas-phase                    
              ion-molecule chemistry.  The use of supersonic sources to                      
              synthesize ions is a powerful new concept that could lead to                   
              significant advances in mass spectrometry.

              Professor Freiser will use a supersonic source for a Fourier                   
              transform mass spectrometer to create and study gas-phase metal                
              ion clusters containing three or more metal atoms.  This                       
              technique combined with laser photochemistry will be used to                   
              study the gas-phase chemistry of these novel cluster compounds.                
              The results will impact directly on the development of improved                
              mass spectrometric instrumentation such as tandem mass                         
              spectrometers.
