Abstract    :
                   This project supports eighteen faculty members from Tribal                
              Colleges which are members of the American Indian Higher Education             
              Consortium (AIHEC) to attend the 1992 American Indian Science and              
              Engineering Society (AISES) Conference in Washington, DC, November             
              5-8, 1992.  This is an extremely worthwhile activity and serves to             
              supplement the program CISE supports to bring faculty, from the                
              more general category of minority institutions, to computer related            
              conferences.  The AISES conferences addresses a much broader range             
              of issues relating to science and engineering education at these               
              institutions which serve a primarily Native American population.               
              It is critical that faculty at minority institutions attend                    
              national conferences of this type in order to become better                    
              integrated into the research and education communities.  This                  
              project represents a strong effort in that direction.
