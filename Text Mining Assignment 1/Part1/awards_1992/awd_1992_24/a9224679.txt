Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support for the operation of the Svalbard               
              Auroral Station to make optical measurements of the dayside                    
              aurora in December 1992 and January 1993.  This site lies in the               
              Eastern Arctic where the sky is dark enough to allow optical                   
              observations of the dayside auroral oval from late November to                 
              late January.  The station is instrumented with a TV all-sky                   
              camera, a 5 channel meridian scanning photometer, a riometer, and              
              also induction and fluxgate magnetometers.  Previous work                      
              established the spectural character and morphology of both the                 
              magnetic pulsations and the auroral forms in the dayside aurora.               
              That the strength and direction of the interplanetary magnetic                 
              field is directly related to the form and motion of the dayside                
              aurora implying that the latter is an ionospheric signature of                 
              plasma entry at the magnetopause.  Correlation of the optical                  
              observations with simultaneous measurements of geomagnetic                     
              pulsations has resulted in a model of the magnetospheric                       
              structure associated with this correlation.  This proposal is to               
              support further the optical measurements required to test this                 
              model of the relationship of the dayside ionosphere to                         
              magnetospheric  boundary layer phenomena.  New data will be                    
              obtained in a coordinated campaign with the GEM-funded project                 
              led by J.V. Olson.  Olson's magnetometers will identify current                
              systems and the optical instruments will record the auroral                    
              features.
