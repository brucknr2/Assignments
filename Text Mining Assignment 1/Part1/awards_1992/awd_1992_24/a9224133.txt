Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Skidaway Institute of Oceanography requests funding to purchase                
              shipboard instrumentation in support of NSF-funded research.                   
              Skidaway owns and operates the R/V BLUE FIN, a 64 foot vessel. The             
              PI is requesting funding to purchase a transmissometer, a                      
              flowmeter, and upgrades to a shipboard data acquisition system. The            
              instrumentation requested will be used aboard the BLUE FIN in                  
              support of 101 days of NSF-funded scientific research in 1993. The             
              requested instrumentation is necessary to adequately support NSF-              
              funded research at Skidaway, and the PI is full capable of managing            
              the acquisition and installation of the instruments.
