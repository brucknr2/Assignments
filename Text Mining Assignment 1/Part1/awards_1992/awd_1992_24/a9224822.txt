              will conduct and coordinate the                                                
              collection of data on many aspects                                             
              regarding Hurricane Andrew using                                               
              the expertise of national and local                                            
              researchers, officials and

              will also conduct some preliminary                                             
              assessment of losses.  The data                                                
              items consist of:  constructed
