Abstract    :
                   Butterflyfishes make excellent models for studying patterns of            
              genetic variation and diversification in marine organisms.  They               
              are common and conspicuous members of coral reef communities and               
              display considerable ecological diversity.  This study is designed             
              to integrate population genetics (using both nuclear and                       
              mitochondrial gene markers) and ecology in an effort to examine                
              overall patterns of variation seen in related species of Indo-west             
              Pacific Butterflyfishes.  Indo-west Pacific coral reef communities             
              are some of the most diverse, and possibly threatened, marine                  
              systems.  Research on Butterflyfishes will provide valuable                    
              information on how such coral reef communities form from an                    
              historical perspective.  In addition, the combined use of genetic              
              and morphological markers will provide a better assessment of the              
              uniqueness of various Butterflyfish stocks occupying these coral               
              reef communities, an absolute necessity for the preservation and               
              management of biodiversity.
