Abstract    :
              9224318  Robert Kuntz    This is an investigation of the influence structure and
              bonding of  molybdenum-sulfur complexes on the efficiency and mechanism of the 
              photocatalytic reduction of acetylene or water.  The electrons for  these
              reductions come from band-gap irradiation of small-particle  titania
              suspensions which serve as a "support" for the molybdenum   complexes. 
              Specific catalysts studied include monomeric and  dimeric forms of
              molybdenum(V) and molybdenum(VI) with ligands  containing sulfur and/or oxygen.
               An objective is the  identification of the species exhibiting high efficiency
              for  trapping conduction-band electrons and catalyzing reduction of  small
              molecules.  Isotherms for adsorption and structures of  adsorbed species are
              investigated for various molybdenum-sulfur  solution species using ultraviolet
              and Raman spectroscopies; the  studies are done in solution or on solid
              surfaces in contact with  solution.  Similar studies are done after
              irradiation, including  the examination of substrates and the determination of
              the  oxidation state of the catalyst by chemical methods.    The use of
              light-driven catalysts (photocatalysis) offers the  potential to convert
              abundant and inexpensive materials to useful  products.  Better understanding
              to improve efficiency is needed,  but these processes offer relatively cheap
              routes to some valuable  products.  They will also reduce fossil fuel
              consumption  (especially when solar radiation can be used) and be 
              environmentally benign.
