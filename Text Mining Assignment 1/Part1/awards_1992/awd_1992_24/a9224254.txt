Abstract    :
              9224254  Andrews  This award supports a program to study sediment cores from the
               inner continental shelf and fjords of East Greenland.  The goals  are to
              determine paleoclimatic conditions and to understand ice-  sheet ocean
              interactions during the late Quaternary.  The project  will use oxygen
              isotopes, carbon-14 ages, benthic foraminifera, and  sediment provenance
              studies to develop a high resolution history of  the paleoenvironmental
              conditions in the region.  This project will  develop information about the
              extent and duration of sea ice cover  on the inner continental shelf of East
              Greenland during the late  Quaternary and about discharge of freshwater from
              melting of land  based ice in the Arctic Basin.  The results of this work
              should be  useful to help constrain models of climate change that are being 
              developed from the Greenland Ice Sheet Project (GISP) ice core.  ***
