Abstract    :
              9224988  Richards  The Earth's hot oxygen corona may play a significant role in
              a  number of important phenomena in the Earth's upper atmosphere.   These
              phenomena include (1) the maintenance of the night  ionosphere, (2) the helium
              balance (escape flux), and (3) the  supply of energetic ions to the
              plasmasphere.  Before these effects  can be studied, it will be necessary to
              develop a numerical model  of hot oxygen which will include quenching of
              metastable species as  important new sources.  It will also be necessary to
              develop a  similar model for hot nitrogen atoms because many reactions produce 
              energetic nitrogen atoms which may impact the hot oxygen geocorona.  The new
              hot oxygen model will employ the 2-stream approach because  it is
              computationally efficient and has already been successfully  applied to similar
              problems in the atmospheres of Earth and Venus.   In addition, the PI has
              already used the 2-stream method  extensively to study the photoelectron and
              auroral electron  problems.  The work proposed here will contribute to the
              advancement of  knowledge by enhancing our understanding of the escape of light
               gases from planetary atmospheres and by a better understanding of  the
              ionosphere and plasmasphere.  This is extremely important if we  are to assess
              the likely impact of human development on the  atmosphere.  The work will
              contribute to education by providing  student access to our comprehensive model
              of the ionosphere and  thermosphere.  ***
