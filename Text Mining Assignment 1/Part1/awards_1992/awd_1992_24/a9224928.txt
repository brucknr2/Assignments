Abstract    :
              Dr. Lon B. Knight and other members of the Chemistry Department of             
              Furman University are being supported to continue a Research                   
              Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry.  For the               
              period 1993-5, ten undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each            
              summer actively engaged in a variety of research projects.                     
              Projects range the traditional areas of chemistry-analytical,                  
              inorganic, organic, physical and biochemistry.  A unique feature of            
              this program is the inclusion of two visiting faculty from regional            
              colleges, who, along with their students will participate in the               
              program.
