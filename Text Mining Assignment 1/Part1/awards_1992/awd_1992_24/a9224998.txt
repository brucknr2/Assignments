                  9224998 Daskin          This project focuses on production and distribution
              activities for perishable commodities where the total time available for
              production and distribution is constrained.  Tradeoffs between production and
              distribution times are modeled and analyzed based on the investigators,
              experiences with production distribution problems in the newspaper industry. 
              Newspapers are produced and distributed in the period of time from the start of
              the press run to the time the last paper is delivered to a subscriber's home. 
              Since several geographically zoned editions or products are produced and
              distributed, sequencing is important.  Newspapers are tracked from the
              production facilities to regional distribution centers where they are
              completed, rebundled and tracked to drop off points to be picked up by home
              delivery carriers.  Given the daily requirement, location, and edition of each
              home delivery route, the location of the printing facility(ies), and the total
              time available for production and distribution, the problem is to determine the
              cost minimizing combination of production and distribution system inputs
              including the number of presses and inserting machines; the number of vehicles
              serving distribution centers and drop off points; the number, location, and
              capacity of distribution centers and drop off points; and the routes taken by
              each vehicle.
