Abstract    :
              9224854  Haller    This award will support collaborative research  between Gary
              Haller, Yale University, and Costas  Vayenas, University of Patras, Greece. 
              The  collaboration will investigate nonfaradaic  electrochemical modification
              of catalyst activity  (NEMCA) on Pt and Pd catalysts.  Three reactions  will be
              studied:  competitive hydrogenation of  toluene and benzene, methanol
              oxidation, and  neopentane hydrogenolysis.  The NEMCA effect will be 
              investigated spectroscopically with scanning  tunneling microscopy and extended
              X-ray absorption  fine structure.    The investigators will pursue
              complementary physical  characterization of the NEMCA effect.  The catalytic 
              reactions will be carried out in both laboratories.   The STM work will be
              performed in Patras and the  EXAFS at Yale.  In both cases, the spectroscopy
              will  be performed in situ, and, to make these studies as  complementary as
              possible, they will be perfomed  using the same in situ reaction conditions.
