Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to develop a conceptually                    
              simple model that can potentially provide new vistas into                      
              the complex nature of the mechanical behavior of                               
              particulate media. This will be achieved by "zooming" down                     
              to the scale of the particle size and numerically examining                    
              the details of the particle geometry, kinetics and                             
              interactions. Through this simple model, a significant                         
              insight into some of the essential features of the                             
              particulate medium micro-mechanical behavior, its influence                    
              on macro-mechanical behavior, the applicability of                             
              homogenization procedures, and the validity of available                       
              deterministic and/or phenomenological models could be obtained.                
              This approach seeks a common ground between the interests of                   
              engineers/mechanicians and lattice models developed by                         
              physicists to achieve full benefits from the available                         
              experiences and accomplishments.
