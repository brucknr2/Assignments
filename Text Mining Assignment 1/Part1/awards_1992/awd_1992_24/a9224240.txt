Abstract    :
                   The ultimate goal of this project is to understand why some               
              weak tropical disturbances become "organized" and intensify into               
              major storms while other similar disturbances do not.  In his                  
              previous work, Dr. Molinari showed that upper tropospheric cyclonic            
              vorticity anomalies often interact with mature hurricanes to                   
              produce renewed intensification.  Using similar techniques and from            
              the perspective of large-scale processes, he will examine the                  
              initial stages of hurricane development.  Particular attention will            
              be given to (1) the opposing influences of vertical shear and upper            
              tropospheric cyclonic vorticity, and (2) the origin and effects of             
              lower tropospheric "surges", which often precede tropical cyclone              
              development.  The approach will be to conduct several case studies,            
              employing large-scale analyses and available aircraft                          
              reconnaissance data.                                                           
                   The importance of this research lies in its potential                     
              contribution to improved hurricane prediction.
