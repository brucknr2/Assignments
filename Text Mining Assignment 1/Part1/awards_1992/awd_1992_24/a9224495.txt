Abstract    :
              This proposal is a request for funds to support travel (travel+                
              registration + subsistence) for 3 USA and 2 Foreign students to                
              attend the Tenth International Symposium on the Chemistry and                  
              Biology of Pteridines to be held March 21-26, 1993.

              This award funds attendance by students at the Tenth International             
              Symposium on the Chemistry and Biology of Pteridines (March 21-26,             
              1993).  It is important to involve students in international                   
              meetings since this is one of the most stimulating environments                
              available.  The meeting itself is important in summarizing recent              
              progress in the field, in relating current to past work, and in                
              stimulating scientific collaborations between investigators.                   
              Pteridine research involves problems stretching from human                     
              metabolic biochemistry to the colors of butterfly wings.
