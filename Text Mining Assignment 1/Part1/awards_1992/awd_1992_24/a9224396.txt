Abstract    :
              The investigators will explore promising geologic deposits in the              
              Madagascar for the remains of Cretaceous mammals.  If the                      
              expedition is successful, the discoveries could revolutionize our              
              understanding of: (1) the origin, biogeography and evolution of                
              the Madagascar mammalian fauna, which id highly endemic and                    
              unbalanced; (2) the biogeography of mammals on other Gondwanan                 
              land masses; (3) the pattern and timing of the separation of the               
              Madagascar from the African mainland; (4) the pattern and timing               
              of mammals faunal migrations to (? and from) the island.  Of                   
              especial interest among the mammals in the origin and evolution                
              of Madagascar's unique primate (lemur) fauna, groups which are                 
              known only from the sub-fossil Quaternary record.
