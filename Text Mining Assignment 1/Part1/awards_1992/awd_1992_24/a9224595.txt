Abstract    :
              9224595  Lin       Internal gravity waves are ubiquitous phenomenon in and
              around  deep convective storms.  Their influence on local weather  conditions,
              however, has still not been fully investigated.         In this study, the
              Principal Investigator will use theoretical  studies and numerical model to
              improve scientific understanding of  the dynamics of mesoscale thermal or
              mechanical forcing in shear  flows with critical levels.  To accomplish this
              objective the  following specific questions will be addressed: What are the 
              transient and nonlinear responses of a shear flow with a critical  level to
              thermal forcing?  How does the wave-outflow interaction  affect the formation
              of a density current in a structured  atmosphere?  What is the ducting
              mechanism and the nonlinear  effects of a structured atmosphere with a shear
              layer and critical  level?  What is the condition for wave trapping in a
              structured  atmosphere with jet-like basic flow and forcing existing in the 
              vicinity or above the critical level?  What are the moist and  rotational
              effects in a shear flow with thermal forcing?  ***
