Abstract    :
              In this study in the Theoretical and Computational Program of                  
              the Division of Chemistry methods are being constructed,                       
              implemented, and tested for the rigorous interpretation of                     
              molecular electronic wavefunctions.  Of particular interest are                
              electronic densities in organic free radicals.  Rigorous                       
              definitions are being obtained for charge-transfer components                  
              of bond energies and for electronegativities of atoms in                       
              molecules.                                                                     
              %%%                                                                            
              The description of the bonding of atoms to form molecules is                   
              being advanced in this program of theoretical and computational                
              chemical studies.  New ways are being developed for defining                   
              the contributions to bond energies and the properties of bound                 
              atoms.
