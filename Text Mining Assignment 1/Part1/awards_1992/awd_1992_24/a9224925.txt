Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor Wiles to work in            
              number theory.  The aim of this project is to try to prove that                
              certain families of elliptic curves over the field of rationals is             
              modular, the famous conjecture of Shimura-Taniyama-Weil.  The                  
              approach will be to prove in general that suitable Galois                      
              representations with values in the two by two matrices , with                  
              entries in the field with three elements, always arise from modular            
              forms.                                                                         
                   This is research in the field of number theory.  Number theory            
              starts with the whole numbers and questions such as the                        
              divisibility of one whole number by another.  It is among the                  
              oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for                 
              purely aesthetic reasons.  However, within the last half century,              
              it has become an essential tool in developing new algorithms for               
              computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics.
