Abstract    :
              9224967  Ashe             This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and
              Organometallic   Program supports research by Dr. Arthur J. Ashe of the  
              Chemistry Department, University of Michigan, on organometallic   compounds of
              Groups 13, 14, and 15.  Emphasis would be placed   on the investigation of
              borepins and other compounds with   multiple bonds to carbon, synthesis of
              polyacetylenes with   heteroatoms on the backbone, and secondary bonding in  
              dibimuthines and related organobismuth compounds.  Compounds   would be
              characterized by X-ray crystallography,   electrochemical measurements, and NMR
              studies.  Delocalization   and aromaticity in borepins will be studied with the
              aid of   computational methods and some novel compounds of transition   metals
              with bismolyls will be prepared.  %%%  The general goal of this project is to
              investigate new   compounds in which elements such as boron, gallium, silicon, 
               tin, and bismuth have multiple bonds to carbon. The character   and reactivity
              of these bonds are not well known.  In addition,   many of these species will
              be associated with transition   metals, introducing the possibility that
              compounds with   interesting solid state properties wil be formed.  ***
