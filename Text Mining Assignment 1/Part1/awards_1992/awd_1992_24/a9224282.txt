Abstract    :
              9224282  DeSouza         This proposal requests funds for one desktop,
              multi-processor  workstation (SUN SPARCstation 10) and six small desktop 
              workstation/terminals (SUN SPARCstation IPC) for use in several  locations.  At
              present, student use of UNIX-based  workstations/terminals is limited to the
              previously mentioned SUN  and three 1988-vintage Textronix workstations. 
              Additional  capabilities must be secured so that the students and faculty can 
              effectively make use of the current state-of-the-art software  available to the
              meteorological community.  This project will allow  Millersville University to
              fully utilize forthcoming technology for  the foreseeable future.  ***
