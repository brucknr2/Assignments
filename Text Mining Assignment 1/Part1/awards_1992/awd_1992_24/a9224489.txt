Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the use of the photochemical                     
              generation of heteroatom ketenes by photolysis of chromium                     
              carbene complexes.  Catalytic processes to prepare                             
              cyclobutanones and beta-lactams will be explored along with                    
              synthetic approaches to sterically hindered carbene complexes.                 
              Photochemical 2+2 and 3+2 cycloadditions will be used to afford                
              beta-lactams and an efficient route to alpha-heteroatom                        
              stannanes, which will be used in Pd catalyzed reactions, will                  
              be developed.  Optically active chromium carbene derived                       
              intermediates including ene carbamates, butenolides and                        
              tetraazamacrocyclic cyclams will be used for asymmetric                        
              synthesis.

              With this Renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is                      
              supporting the research of Dr. Louis S. Hegedus of the                         
              Department of Chemistry at Colorado State University.                          
              Professor Hegedus will focus his work on the development of new                
              synthetic methods using transition metal complexes to permit                   
              new modes of reactivity for organic functional groups.                         
              Efficient synthetic approaches to a variety of heterocyclic and                
              carbocyclic systems will be developed.
