Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is a study of the globalization of environmental                     
              degradation using time-series and panel regression analyses of                 
              cross-national data.  It will compare a variety of theories,                   
              including neo-Malthusianism, modernization theory, world                       
              system/dependency theory, ecological-evolutionary/human ecology                
              theory, and state-centric theories of political development.                   
              Dependent variables will include rates of greenhouse gas                       
              production, deforestation, air pollution, toxic wastes, and other              
              measures of land, soil and water degradation.                                  
                                                                                             
                   This research will contribute greatly to our understanding of             
              how social factors contribute to environmental degradation, thus               
              providing information and insights for policy makers concerned with            
              protecting the environment.  In addition to this valuable                      
              contribution to public policy, the study will advance social                   
              science by testing several of the major competing theories of how              
              society operates.
