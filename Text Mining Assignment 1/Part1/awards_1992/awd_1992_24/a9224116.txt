Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Midwestern streams are dominated by complex algal                              
              growth during much of the year.  Interactions among                            
              predators, grazing minnows and crayfish could strongly                         
              affect this algal structure.  Interactions between                             
              grazers and their shared predator may influence algal                          
              habitat structure and furthermore have cascading                               
              effects on other stream-fish interactions with                                 
              important consequences for community structure.  This                          
              study will focus on such effects and possible                                  
              behavioral mechanisms.  Surveys throughout Oklahoma                            
              will test the generality and strength of relationships                         
              among the algivorous minnow Campostoma anomalum,                               
              crayfish, their shared predators, algal standing crop,                         
              abiotic habitat variables and various aspects of                               
              stream-fish community structure.  Manipulative                                 
              experiments will isolate abiotic and biotic variables                          
              that affect interactions among two grazers (C.                                 
              anomalum and crayfish), their shared predator (bass)                           
              and algal structure.  Further experiments will study                           
              the affects of algal structure on interactions among                           
              two invertivorous fishes and their shared predator                             
              (bass).
