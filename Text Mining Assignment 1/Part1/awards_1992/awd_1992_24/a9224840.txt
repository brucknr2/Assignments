Abstract    :
                   The research involves deep questions related to the study of              
              L^2-analytic torsion and the relationship with the Von-Neumann-                
              Reidermeister torsion.  Determinants of operators relative                     
              to elliptic boundary problems, periodic problems and inequalities              
              between Dirichlet and Neumann eigenvalues for domains with large               
              isometry groups are also to be considered.
