Abstract    :
              9224604  Yariv  This project wil investigate the fundamental noise properties of
              semiconductor lasers.  The need for narrow bandwidth and frequency stabilized
              semiconductor lasers in coherent lightwave communication networks is crucial. 
              For multi-channel distribution systems it is important that the laser frequency
              will be known exactly.  In addition narrow laser linewidth increases the S/N
              ratio and the network's channel capacity.  Narrow linewidth lasers are also
              needed for microwave links, precision spectroscopy, time and frequency
              standards and many other important applications.  This research is motivated
              with the view of a significant, orders of magnitude, reduction of the quantum
              limited phase noise and increased frequency stability of the semiconductor
              laser.  Another prospect is amplitude noise squeezing below the standard
              quantum noise limit.  These important problems  will be pursed using the
              concept of a semiconductor laser with dispersive loss.  This work will continue
              and expand unfunded, exploratory studies in our group.  The early results from
              these preliminary studies are promising.  A subcontract to Professor Shevy at
              the University of Miami will contribute to the work on frequency stabilization
              and linewidth reduction  ***
