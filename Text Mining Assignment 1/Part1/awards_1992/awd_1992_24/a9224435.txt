Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will provide partial support for a standing Committee               
              on Astronomy and Astrophysics (CAA).  As a joint committee of the              
              National Research Council's Space Studies Board and Board on                   
              Physics and Astronomy, the CAA will be the primary source of                   
              advice at the National Research Council concerning astronomy and               
              astrophysics and will develop independent strategic advice to                  
              Federal agencies, coordinating across agency boundaries.  Support              
              for this activity is jointly shared with the National Aeronautics              
              and Space Administration.
