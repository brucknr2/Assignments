Abstract    :
                   The Department of Mathematics has been invited to sponsor                 
              the Nevanlinna Colloquium in June of 1993, the 15th in a series                
              of conferences known for their broad coverage in complex                       
              analysis, their instructional goals and their international                    
              character.                                                                     
                   A primary aim of the proposed conference is to acquaint                   
              students and young researchers with recent developments in and                 
              connections between the following areas of function theory:                    
                             1. Circle packing,                                              
                             2. Harmonic measure,                                            
                             3. Complex interation,                                          
                             4. Hyperbolic geometry,                                         
                             5. Riemann surfaces,                                            
                             6. Discrete groups.                                             
                   The meeting will feature general expository morning talks by              
              experts in each of these areas followed by more specialized                    
              presentations in the afternoons.
