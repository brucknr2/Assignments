Abstract    :
              ***  9224093  Malone  How important are managerial tools like total quality 
              management, business reengineering, and information  technology?  The goal of
              this project is to provide a firmer  theoretical and empirical foundation for
              understanding and  using them.  To do this, the project will include (1) 
              collecting examples of how different organizations perform  similar processes,
              and (2) representing these examples in an  on line "process hand book" which
              includes the relative  advantages of the alternatives.  The handbook is
              intended to  help (a) redesign existing organizational processes, (b)  invent
              new organizational processes that take advantage of  information technology,
              and perhaps (c) automatically  generate software to support organizational
              processes.  A  key intellectual contribution of the work is expected to be  a
              novel approach to representing processes at various levels  of abstraction.
              This approach uses ideas from computer  science about inheritance and from
              coordination theory about  managing dependencies.  Its primary advantage is
              that it  allows users to explicitly represent the similarities (and 
              differences) among related processes and to easily find or  generate sensible
              alternatives for how a given process could  be performed.  ***
