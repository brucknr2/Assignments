Abstract    :
                   This research combines experimental measurements of reaction              
              kinetics in titanium aluminide-based intermetallic alloys with                 
              detailed quantitative transmission electron microscopy to study                
              massive phase transformations.  Changes in atomic configuration                
              occurring during phase transformation are examined and the                     
              associated kinetic, thermodynamic, and crystallographic features               
              are explored.  Novel experimental techniques incorporating a                   
              computer interfaced for control and high speed data acquisition                
              provide in situ measurements of K and electrical resistivity.                  
              Controlled gas quenching permits variation in cooling rate.  The               
              experimental measurements are incorporated in quantitative                     
              thermodynamic models to establish mechanisms of interface                      
              migration.                                                                     
              %%%                                                                            
                   New alloys based on the titanium aluminide alloy system are of            
              great importance for applications in high temperature aerospace                
              systems because of their unique combinations of properties.  Design            
              of these alloys depends on understanding the phase transformations             
              and phase equilibria that control mechanical properties.
