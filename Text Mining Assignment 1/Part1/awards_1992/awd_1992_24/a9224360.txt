Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The University of Alaska requests funding to purchase shipboard                
              instrumentation in support of NSF-funded research.  The instruments            
              will be used aboard the R/V ALPHA HELIX, a 133 foot vessel, which              
              is owned by NSF and operated by the University. The PI requested               
              funding to purchase a CTD system, a multiple corer, Niskin bottles,            
              and a wire angle indicator.  The instrumentation was requested to              
              provide adequate support for NSF-funded scientific research.
