Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                  
              Program provides continued support for the research of Dr.                     
              Richard D. Adams of the Chemistry Department, University of                    
              South Carolina, on the synthesis and characterization of metal                 
              cluster compounds.  Carbonyl compounds containing platinum and                 
              iron, ruthenium or osmium will be prepared and characterized by                
              IR, NMR, and X-ray crystallography.  The usefulness of the                     
              compounds as petroleum reforming catalysts will be tested,                     
              especially with regard to selective catalysis that might be                    
              associated through the cooperativity of different types of                     
              metal atoms.  Some of the models include compounds in which                    
              metals have segregated to particular layers within the                         
              structure, and the effect of this effect on catalytic activity                 
              will be investigated.  Alkyne substitution reactions will be                   
              used to test the reactivity of sites within the clusters.

              Mixed-metal and metal-alloy catalysts are employed industrially                
              to promote hydrogenation reactions, but a molecular model of                   
              these compounds which can be used to understand the beneficial                 
              effects of the mixed-metal materials has not been synthesized.                 
              In this project, molecular models of mixed metal compounds will                
              be prepared and their reactivity in various catalytic reactions                
              determined.  The research could provide insights into the                      
              detailed mechanisms of catalytic reactions and aid in the                      
              development of selective hydrogenation catalysts.
