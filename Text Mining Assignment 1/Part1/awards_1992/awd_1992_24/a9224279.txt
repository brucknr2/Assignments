Abstract    :
              This award is made as the starter grant increment of Dr. Omar                  
              Yaghi's Postdoctoral Fellowship in Chemistry Award in support                  
              of his research at Arizona State University.  The theme of the                 
              research is the development of synthetic strategies for the                    
              rational synthesis of solid state metal oxides and sulfides.                   
              Part of the work entails aggregating clusters using heteroatoms                
              or organic molecules capable of binding selectively to the face                
              or edge of a cluster.  The remainder of the work involves                      
              hydrothermal synthesis of microporous sulfides using molecular                 
              metal sulfides known to be stable to hydrolysis.

              The development of new methods for the preparation of solid                    
              state materials can lead to the discovery of compounds which                   
              may have novel electrical and mechanical properties.  These                    
              substances may have commercial significance in the chemical                    
              industry.
