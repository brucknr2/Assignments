Abstract    :
              Johnson  Gross  9224876           The brain is protected from contact with the
              environment by a  relatively impermeable blood-brain barrier induced by the 
              neuroglial cells that surround brain capillaries. But there are  gaps in this
              barrier. Specially differentiated organs --  circumventricular organs -- in the
              ventricular walls contain  neurons with receptors for a variety of blood-borne
              chemicals.  These neurons form early warning networks that maintains brain and 
              body homeostasis. They are influential regulators of autonomic and 
              neuroendocrine system functions. Some of these organs have shown to  be
              crucially important in the regulation of blood pressure but  there is as yet no
              understanding of the role of the newly  discovered peptide neurotransmitters or
              how the organs function  together as a system. This NSF grant will allow eight
              young  scientists to participate in a summer research conference on the 
              circumventricular organs organized by the Federated Societies of  Experimental
              Biology. The purpose of this conference is to bring  basic and clinical
              scientists together to exchange information and  to foster a greater
              understanding of the potential importance of  this area of research.  ***
