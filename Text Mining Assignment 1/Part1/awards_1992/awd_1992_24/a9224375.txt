Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to facilitate the use of partial                   
              evaluation in broader applications and by a larger class of                    
              users. To do so, a comprehensive plan to refine and extend the                 
              design and implementation of partial evaluation systems is                     
              proposed. The anticipated contributions of this work include:                  
                                                                                             
                  Improving the quality of residual programs by exploring                   
                   and designing new tools for a programming environment of                  
                   a partial evaluation system, and by developing new                        
                   techniques to improve the accuracy of the binding-time                    
                   analysis.                                                                 
                                                                                             
                  Extending partial evaluation to handle side-effects by                    
                   developing an automatic binding-time analysis and a                       
                   program specializer. The first part of this work will                     
                   focus on the notion of references a la ML.                                
                                                                                             
              The improvements described above will allow further                            
              applications of partial evaluation in some areas as well as                    
              the attack upon new ones.  Examples from the area of compiler                  
              generation are sub-typing, generic functions, exceptions, and                  
              task operations. A novel use of partial evaluation in                          
              operating systems involves using partial evaluation to derive                  
              automatically implementations of operating system components                   
              from generic specifications.
