Abstract    :
              The objective of this Workshop on Earthquake                                   
              Site Response and Seismic Code Provisions,                                     
              November 18-20, 1992, University of Southern                                   
              California, concerns the effects of site response                              
              on earthquake ground motions; the aim is to                                    
              develop recommendations for modifications to                                   
              existing design guidelines and codes for                                       
              earthquake site response.  It follows on from the                              
              Site Effects Workshop held at the University of                                
              New York at Buffalo in 1991.                                                   
                                                                                             
              Financial support for this workshop is provided                                
              by the National Science Foundation, the                                        
              National Center for Earthquake Engineering                                     
              Research (NCEER), the U.S. Geological Survey                                   
              (USGS) and the Southern California Earthquake                                  
              Center (SCEC).                                                                 
                                                                                             
              The need to examine the soil categories and site                               
              factors (S factors) used in building code site                                 
              response provisions arises from: (a) concerns                                  
              with the existing definitions of site factors, and                             
              (b) the fact that current building code provisions                             
              (that is, soil factors S1 through S3) were                                     
              developed in the mid-1970's (S4 was added                                      
              following the 1985 Mexico earthquake).  The                                    
              need for this workshop is further highlighted by                               
              the accumulation in recent years of extensive                                  
              research data and new knowledge on site                                        
              response effects.  It is strongly supported by                                 
              committees involved in: (a) the planned 1994                                   
              revision of the NEHRP (National Earthquake                                     
              Hazard Reduction Program) Recommended                                          
              Provisions for The Development of Seismic                                      
              Regulations for New Buildings; and (b) by the                                  
              Structural Engineers Association of California's                               
              (SEAOC) 1993 planned revision of the "Blue                                     
              Book".  The results from this workshop will                                    
              provide essential input and recommendations to                                 
              these committees' activities.                                                  
                                                                                             
              The workshop involves geotechnical engineers,                                  
              seismologists and structural engineers.  It is                                 
              planned to publish the workshop proceedings in                                 
              March 1993.
