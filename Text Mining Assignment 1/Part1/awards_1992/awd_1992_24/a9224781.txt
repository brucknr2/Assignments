              research in radiative heat transfer.  The                                      
              workshop will center on problems and                                           
              applications in which radiation is highly                                      
              coupled with other heat transfer mechanisms.                                   
              Specific topics to be discussed will be: (1)                                   
              Radiation in Porous, Particulate, or Composite                                 
              Media; (2) Radiation in Combustion; and (3)                                    
              Radiative-Convective Heat Transfer in Low-                                     
              Temperature Plasmas.  Based on the technical                                   
              discussions, cooperative research projects                                     
              between groups in the U.S. and in Russia and                                   
              Belorussia will be identified.                                                 
                                                                                             
              This project in energy studies and mechanical                                  
              engineering fulfills the program objectives of                                 
              advancing science by enabling leading experts                                  
              in the U.S., Belorussia, and Russia to combine                                 
              complementary talents and pool research                                        
              resources in the areas of strong mutual                                        
              interest and competence.
