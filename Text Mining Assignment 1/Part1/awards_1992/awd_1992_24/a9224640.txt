Abstract    :
                9224640     Patrikalakis    This is the first year funding of a three-year
              continuing award.   This research is also sponsored by the MIT Sea Grant
              College  Program at the level of $75,000 per year.  The objective of this 
              project is to advance the state of knowledge in efficiently  representing,
              interrogating, visualizing, updating and manipulating  vast amounts of
              geophysical data.  The research combines, in a  synergistic effort, database
              and visualization expertise from  computer science, computational geometry
              expertise, advanced  concepts from theoretical and applied mathematics with
              concrete  geophysical data with the goal to prove the practicality of the 
              developed database concepts for a challenging automated navigation  problem. 
              Specific objectives are: (1) to attack the problem of  multidimensional
              physical data representation using advanced higher  dimensional geometric
              concepts; (2) to address the problem of  uncertainty in data representation and
              computation by invoking the  concept of interval splines and the theory of
              interval arithmetic;  (3) to study the problem of geometric and physical
              information  storage, retrieval, reconstruction and interrogation by applying 
              methods from differential topology and algebraic topology; (4) to  develop new
              methods for continuous non-linear data representation  and interrogation using
              global topological generalized boundary  representation databases based on the
              cell-tuple structure; and (5)  to evaluate the developed concepts in a
              preliminary fashion in a  practical example involving autonomous underwater
              vehicle (AUV)  navigation using a marine geophysical database.  The database 
              techniques developed in this project will enhance the conduct of  research in
              environmental and ocean sciences and engineering and  other disciplines
              studying continuous physical phenomena.  ***
