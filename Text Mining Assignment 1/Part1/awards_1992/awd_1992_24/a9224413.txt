Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Research Planning Grant for Women assesses women's                        
              participation in, and support for, working-class movements.  The               
              project specifically investigates womens strike involvement and                
              support, employing the cases of the 1989-1990 United Mine Workers              
              of America (UMWA) strike against Pittston Coal Company (USA) and               
              the 1984-1985 National Union of Miners (NUM) strike against British            
              Coal in the United Kingdom of Great Britain.  Women actively                   
              supported these strikes but were mobilized in contexts in which                
              their standing was indirect.  Only miners have direct standing and             
              indentity in mining strikes, and, in the United States and Britain,            
              miners are exclusively men.  This planning grant develops a                    
              framework of movement standing with specific regard to women, and              
              employs a modified political opportunity model for understanding               
              women's movement activism.                                                     
                                                                                             
              The planning grant promises to develop a model for comparing strike            
              involvement and gender participation differences in two countries.             
              The comparative nature of the project should enhance our                       
              understanding of these phenomena.
