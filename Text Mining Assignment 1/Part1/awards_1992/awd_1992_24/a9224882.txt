Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will assist the Department of Chemistry at the University of                   
              Pittsburgh in the purchase of a high resolution Mass                           
              Spectrometer.  Six faculty members whose research is dependent                 
              upon high resolution mass spectroscopy will greatly benefit                    
              from the acquisition of this instrument.  Research projects to                 
              be carried out with this instrument include:  (1) The mechanism                
              of action of vitamin K, (2) New synthetic methods for an                       
              industrial environment, (3) Total organic synthesis of natural                 
              products, (4) Gas phase ion chemistry, (5) Molecular                           
              recognition:  Novel artifical receptors for complexation and                   
              catalysis and (6) Research on Molecular recognition.

              A high resolution mass spectrometer is an instrument used to                   
              measure the precise molecular weight of a molecular ion.  This                 
              information is an important piece of data used to help                         
              determine the atomic composition and, sometimes, the molecular                 
              geometry of a molecule.  It is one of the essential tools                      
              needed to learn the detailed structure of newly synthesized                    
              molecules.
