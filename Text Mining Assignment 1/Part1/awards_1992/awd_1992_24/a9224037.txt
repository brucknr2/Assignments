Abstract    :
              The study of cultural attention to risk has developed greatly                  
              over the past two decades.  One area where there has been only                 
              limited work is that of non-western perceptions of and responses               
              to risk.  This study of the management of technological risks in               
              China seeks to expand cross-cultural understanding of the social               
              construction of risk by examining how different cultural                       
              formations in modern China have interacted with powerful                       
              influences from the international environment in devising                      
              responses to risks.  Through archival research and interviews,                 
              both in the United States and in China, the project will develop               
              case studies of Chinese risk management strategies for flood                   
              control, nuclear power, hazardous chemicals and airline                        
              operations.  In addition to adding an important non-western                    
              example to the comparative risk analysis literature, the project               
              should contribute to understanding how major influences from                   
              abroad, including technology transfers, international educational              
              experiences, membership in international organizations, study and              
              emulation of foreign policy models, and exposure to foreign risk               
              controversies, affect a nation's "risk transitions."  Sharpening               
              an appreciation of how risks are identified, assessed, and                     
              managed will also provide additional insights into Chinese                     
              approaches to its complex environmental problems and, thus, how                
              to build a stronger base for what is likely to be a long-term                  
              international engagement with China on environmental affairs.
