Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A current problem in evolutionary biology is to                                
              understand why some morphological traits of animals and                        
              plants are plastic and others are rigidly determined.                          
              A combination of genetic, developmental, and behavioral                        
              studies is required to solve it.  The proposed research                        
              will make a contribution to the solution.  A species of                        
              beetle has been chosen for investigation because it has                        
              a highly variable trait and because the type of                                
              selection it is subjected to is clear.  The goals of                           
              the research are to assess (1) whether plasticity in                           
              this trait shows heritable variation and (2) the                               
              significance of variation in this trait.                                       
                                                                                             
              In addition to their value in throwing light on a                              
              complex evolutionary problem, results of this research                         
              will have potential benefits to the applied field of                           
              conservation biology.  An important factor determining                         
              the persistence of species under threat of extinction                          
              is its ability to respond ecologically and                                     
              evolutionarily to a changed environment.  This study of                        
              phenotypic variation and plasticity will show how                              
              flexible responses are controlled and expressed.
