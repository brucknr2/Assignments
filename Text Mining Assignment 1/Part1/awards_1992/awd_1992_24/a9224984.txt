Abstract    :
                   This REU site award provides support for six undergraduate                
              researchers working with faculty advisors.  Research projects                  
              will be chosen from five areas.  Five faculty will contribute to               
              the project. They will focus on topics such as hyperbolic                      
              geometry of surfaces and geometric group theory with special                   
              interest in circle packings of surfaces and how the combinatorial              
              structure of surfaces restricts their geometry.  Also considered               
              will be studies of fundamental groups and covering spaces with an              
              eye to constructing all covering spaces of spaces with given                   
              monodromy groups. Work will also be done on polynomial                         
              factorization such as the computation of Galois groups as                      
              permutation groups.  This research involves computer algebras                  
              systems such as Mathematica. Other students will focus on large-               
              scale numerical modeling of geophysical flow, the application of               
              optimization methods to the retrieval of the earth's structure                 
              and of groundwater aquifer.                                                    
                   Florida State University traditionally conducts several                   
              undergraduate research activities each year.  Additionally, there              
              is an Alliance for Minority Participation program on campus to                 
              add to the opportunities for students to meet and take advantage               
              of seminars, visiting speakers etc.  Two major campus institutes,              
              one in geophysical fluid dynamics and one in supercomuting also                
              add to the intellectual life and experience of the students.
