Abstract    :
              The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will continue the                     
              scientific planning and management of the Coastal Ocean Processes              
              (CoOP) research initiative.  CoOP planning is being undertaken by              
              a group of scientists dedicated to organizing large scale efforts              
              in interdisciplinary coastal ocean basic research.  CoOP includes              
              representation from biological oceanography, chemical oceanography,            
              geological oceanography, marine meteorology and physical oceano-               
              graphy.  Previous planning support has resulted in the publication             
              and circulation of a major planning document: "Coastal Ocean                   
              Processes: A Science Prospectus".  Through a series of workshops               
              and the deliberations of a scientific planning conmmittee, this                
              follow-on activity will start to define the actual process studies             
              and long-term measurements to be made.
