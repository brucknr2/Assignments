              This project will provide support for shipboard scientific support             
              equipment for the research vessel POINT SUR, an NSF owned ship                 
              operated by the San Jose State University, Moss   Landing Marine               
              Laboratory, and dedicated to use in support of ocean science                   
              research.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides funds              
              for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe conduct             
              of ocean science research. This Program provides support for such              
              items as deck equipment including winch systems for the deployment             
              and retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational equipment                
              such as radars, gyroscopes and earth satellite receivers to   pin              
              point the location of research sites, communication equipment                  
              including radio  transceivers and satellite transceivers for voice             
              and scientific data communications and other equipment such as                 
              motorized workboats for transporting scientists to and from data               
              retrieval sites.                                                               
                                                                                             
              The Project Director, Dr. John Martin is full qualified to direct              
              this project having had considerable experience in overseeing the              
              acquisition and installation of shipboard equipment.                           
                                                                                             
              This project which will allow the institution to replace an ageing             
              radar and acquire a wireless intercom.
