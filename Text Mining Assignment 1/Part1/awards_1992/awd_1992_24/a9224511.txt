Abstract    :
              This grant provides support for research which will make use of                
              simultaneous observations of ultra low frequency (ULF)                         
              electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves by instruments located              
              in the Arctic, the Antarctic and on satellites orbiting within the             
              Earth's magnetosphere.  These pulsations have frequencies of                   
              between 0.1 and 5 Hz.  The ground-based instruments are (or were)              
              in Sondre Stromfjord, Greenland, the Finnish magnetometer chain,               
              and the Antarctic stations, Siple, South Pole, McMurdo, Casey,                 
              Mawson and MacQuarie Island.  The satellites to be used are the                
              AMPTE (Active Magnetospheric Particle Tracer Explorers/CCE (Charge-            
              Composition Explorer) and Viking (Swedish).  The eventual goal of              
              this correlative study is to enhance the utility of future ground-             
              based observations to be used as a diagnostic tool to infer                    
              magnetospheric processes in the EMIC source region.
