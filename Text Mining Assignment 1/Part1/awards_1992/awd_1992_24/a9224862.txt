Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This U.S.-Russia "Workshop on Time Reversal                                    
              Invariance and Parity Violation in Neutron                                     
              Scattering" will send ten American researchers                                 
              from TRIPLE (North Carolina State University,                                  
              Duke University, and Los Alamos National                                       
              Laboratory) to work with a group of Russian                                    
              scientists led by Dr. Yuriy P. Popov at the Joint                              
              Institute of Nuclear Research, Dubna.  The                                     
              workshop will focus on the study of parity and                                 
              time reversal symmetry violation in neutron                                    
              physics.  A prime motivation for holding the                                   
              workshop in Russia is that much of the early work                              
              in the study of parity violation was carried out                               
              by scientists in Moscow, Dubna, St. Petersburg                                 
              and Novosibirsk.  Since 1987 much of the major                                 
              work on symmetry violation has been carried out                                
              by the TRIPLE collaboration working at the Los                                 
              Alamos Neutron Scattering Center.  Half of the                                 
              funds are to support attendance by graduate                                    
              students and research associates.                                              
                                                                                             
              This project in physics fulfills the program                                   
              objectives of advancing science by enabling                                    
              leading experts in the U.S. and Russia to combine                              
              complementary talents and pool research resources                              
              in the areas of strong mutual interest and                                     
              competence.
