Abstract    :
              This is one of four coordinated projects that will make use of the             
              camp facilities established on the ice sheet in the interior of                
              Greenland as part of the GISP-2 ice core drilling effort, in order             
              to investigate how atmospheric trace elements are deposited on the             
              ice and what kind of changes they undergo as they are being                    
              incorporated into the ice.  An understanding of such processes is              
              necessary in order to properly interpret the proxy climate data                
              that can be recovered from ice cores.  While significant progress              
              has been made recently in extracting and analyzing ice cores,                  
              progress in understanding the air to snow transfer process for                 
              reactive chemical species has lagged behind.                                   
                                                                                             
              The goal of this project is to determine the vertical fluxes of                
              reactive nitrogen oxides, water vapor, sensible heat, and momentum.            
              through a field measurement program in 1994 and 1995.  A specific              
              objective is to define the transfer function between reactive                  
              nitrogen oxide concentrations in the atmosphere and in the snow,               
              thus allowing the interpretation of the nitrate record in ice cores            
              in terms of changes in atmospheric photochemistry and in the                   
              biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen.  Other objectives are to                   
              determine the environmental variables regulating the exchange of               
              reactive nitrogen oxides between air and snow, to assess the                   
              relative importance of dr and wet deposition and reevaporation in              
              controlling the nitrate accumulation, and to analyze the                       
              meteorological conditions controlling the supply of nitrates to the            
              ice sheet.
