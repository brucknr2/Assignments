Abstract    :
                   The funding will support the conference on Fundamental                    
              Aspects of Quantum Theory at the University of South Carolina                  
              on December 10-12, 1992.  The conference brings together from                  
              around the world experts on the theoretical and experimental                   
              foundations of quantum mechanics and its connections to gauge                  
              theory, condensed-matter physics and quantum gravity.  Other                   
              topics that will be discussed are quantum optics, quantum                      
              statistics, quantum cosmology, the measurement problem, and                    
              geometric phases.  The proceedings will be published.
