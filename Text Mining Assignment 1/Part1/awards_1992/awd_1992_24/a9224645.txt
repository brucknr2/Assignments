Abstract    :
              This project will support travel by the principal investigator to              
              two international conferences: (1) a conference on corner                      
              singularities for elliptic boundary value problems to be held in               
              Luminy, France and (2) a conference on numerical analysis, to be               
              held at the Nankai Institute, in Tianjin, China.  The principal                
              investigator will actively participate in both programs by giving              
              lectures on the topics of the conferences.
