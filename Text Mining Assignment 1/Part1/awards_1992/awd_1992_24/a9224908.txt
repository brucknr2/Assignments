Abstract    :
              This award will support the Minitrack on Software Support for                  
              Genome Mapping and Sequencing, to take place at the 26th Hawaii                
              International Conference on Systems Sciences, to be held in                    
              Kauai, Hawaii, January 5-8, 1993.  The one day workshop                        
              consisting of paper presentations and discussion sessions will                 
              bring together computational specialists and biologists                        
              interested in computational aspects of mapping and DNA                         
              sequencing.  The workshop will include a panel discussion section              
              in which genome researchers will evaluate the usefulness and                   
              significance of the presented research in light of their current               
              computation tools and projected needs.  This workshop is being                 
              supported cooperatively with the National Center for Human Genome              
              Research of the National Institutes of Health and with the                     
              Department of Energy.
