Abstract    :
                9224559  Chu    SDB:  A Cooperative, Spatial, and Evolutionary Biomedical
              Database  System    This is the first year funding of a three-year continuing
              award.   The objective of this research is to develop a distributed 
              knowledge-based multimedia database system for biomedical  applications with
              cooperative query answering capabilities.  The  system will be able to access
              data in image databases by content  (features, objects, etc.).  In particular,
              the proposed data model  captures spatial and evolutionary semantics and thus
              greatly  enhances high-level query capabilities.  The image objects and  their
              features are obtained from segmentation software and are  stored in the
              database.  Using rules derived from domain knowledge,  approximate and
              conceptual queries may be answered.  Additional  information relevant to a
              query cay be provided by associating  different hierarchies of subjects.  Type
              abstraction hierarchies  (TAHs) generalize a query's scope while the relaxation
              control,  based on user profiles and query context, trims the TAHs and keeps 
              the generalizations manageable and appropriate.  An explanation  system tracks
              the relaxation path and provides a measure of the  nearness of the approximate
              answer to the exact one.  These  concepts are validated in a testbed linked
              with radiology image  databases.  The joint research between the UCLA Computer
              Science  Department and the School of Medicine assures that the prototype 
              systems are of direct interest to radiology research and practice.   The
              results of this research are extensible to other multimedia  database
              applications.   ***
