Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a project to study a small valley                 
              glacier in northern Sweden, Storglaciaren.  The three objectives               
              of this project are 1) to develop an empirical relation between                
              melt rates on the glacier surface and meteorological forcing, 2)               
              to establish a relation between subglacial water pressures and                 
              velocities at the glacier surface, and 3) to measure strain                    
              rates, shear stresses, and water pressures in the subglacial till              
              in order to establish a constitutive relation for till                         
              deformation.  A long-term goal of this work is to develop a model              
              to predict glacier motion on diurnal to seasonal time scales.
