Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a project to study a small valley                 
              glacier in northern Sweden, Storglaciaren.  The three objectives of            
              this project are 1) to develop an empirical relation between melt              
              rates on the glacier surface and meteorological forcing, 2) to                 
              establish a relation between subglacial water pressures and                    
              velocities at the glacier surface, and 3) to measure strain rates,             
              shear stresses, and water pressures in the subglacial till in order            
              to establish a constitutive relation for till deformation.  A long-            
              term goal of this work is to develop a model to predict glacier                
              motion on diurnal to seasonal time scales.
