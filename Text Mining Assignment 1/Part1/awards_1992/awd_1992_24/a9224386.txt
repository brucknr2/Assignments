Abstract    :
              9224386   McGrath      This project provides support for a group of American  
              engineering faculty and industry partners to attend a workshop    to be held in
              Frankfurt, Germany, May 10-15, 1994.  The   workshop will focus on
              academic-industry partnerships in   relation to training American engineers to
              produce goods and   services for the world marketplace, thereby enhancing
              American    global competitiveness.  The primary goal of the workshop is   to
              develop a collaborative program between universities and   industry in which
              German companies as well as American   companies with German subsidiaries
              accept American engineering    students for summer industrial-academic
              experiences in   Germany.  The program will involve chemical and mechanical  
              engineering students.  The workshop will be organized by the   German
              organization, DECHEMA, in cooperation with the National    Science Foundation
              and the DAAD (Deutscher Akademmischer   Austauschdienst).  Participants will
              include US and German   industry and academic representatives as well as
              government   and foundation representatives - all of whom will be selected   on
              the basis of interest and experience with such   international engineering
              programs.  Support is requested for   transportation costs and living expenses
              for workshop   participants.  Industry representatives will be encouraged to   
              cover all of their own expenses if possible.   ***
