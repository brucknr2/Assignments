                  9224810 Ignizio          Examples of the pattern classification problem
              (known variously as:  pattern recognition, discriminant analysis, and pattern
              grouping) seem to be found virtually anywhere and everywhere.  In general such
              problems involve the need to assign objects to various groups, or classes. 
              Recent attempts to solve this problem  have employed linear programming methods
              and, in particular, neural networks.  In this research an approach will be
              developed that combines linear programming (specifically, traditional linear
              programming and/or linear goal programming) with neural networks   an approach
              that should prove to be a significant advance over earlier and ongoing attempts
              toward the development of such combinations.          Ongoing efforts toward
              neural network design/training via linear programming have failed to either
              consider or include an adequately rigorous treatment of the specifics of
              hardware replication.  The researchers will develop and evaluate a detailed
              representation of all pertinent network processing elements and connections in
              order  that direct replication via hardware ultimately be permitted.
