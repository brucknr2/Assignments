Abstract    :
              9224015  Cozzens  The growth of the neurosciences is one of the major
              developments in  biology in the post-war period.  This professional development
               fellowship will enable a social scientist who has been studying  these
              developments to gain training and experience in the  neurosciences and
              coordinate that training with study of the  historical evolution and
              institutionalization of neuroscience.  She  will use this background to
              complete research on the connections  between the development and directions of
              this scientific field and  its consequences for various social groups.  The
              award provides for  tutorials, coursework, and laboratory work under the
              guidance of  the neuroscience faculty at the Johns Hopkins University.  It also
               allows the awardee to interview a number of the past presidents of  the
              Society for Neuroscience.  At the conclusion of this period,  she intends to
              have a detailed chapter outline for a monograph on  autonomy and power in the
              neurosciences.  ***
