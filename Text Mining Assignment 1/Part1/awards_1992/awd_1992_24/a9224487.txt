Abstract    :
                   The object of this research is to develop a shape memory alloy            
              (SMA) constitutive model that incorporates martensitic                         
              transformation characteristics, temperature, multiaxial stress, and            
              austenite texture as inputs.  Crystallographic characteristics of              
              the martensite transformation are built into the model.                        
              Thermodynamic characteristics of the martensite transformation are             
              incorporated into the SMA model through temperature dependent                  
              factors in the constitutive equations, combined with strain energy             
              effects from prior studies of thermoelastic martensite.  The goal              
              is to have the model predict effects of temperature, stress state,             
              and texture on SMA response.

                   The above SMA model could have a wide variety of uses,                    
              including determining the thermo-mechanical response of a structure            
              that incorporates shape memory alloy components, use as a material             
              selection guide for alloys, and as a materials processing guide to             
              produce favorable textures to enhance SMA response.
