Abstract    :
              This study of the heat and volume transport from the Arctic Ocean              
              through the Canadian Archipelago to Baffin Bay and the North                   
              Atlantic Ocean will be based at Resolute, NWT, Canada, and will                
              examine the diapycnal exchange of energy, salt, and momentum among             
              the various regional water masses.  The observational phase will               
              include measurements of the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic              
              energy, of the vertical temperature and salinity microstructure,               
              and of the high resolution current structure.                                  
                                                                                             
              Barrow Strait is bathymetrically complex, consisting of several                
              interconnecting narrow deep passages, partially isolated by                    
              relatively shallow sills.  It is however the pathway for a                     
              significant fraction of the outflow from the Arctic Ocean.                     
                                                                                             
              This work will be the first detailed investigation of the principal            
              mechanisms responsible for the vertical diffusion of heat, salt,               
              and momentum in this region.  These not only affect the seasonal               
              growth and melting of sea ice, but also modify the advective                   
              exchange rates by affecting the upwelling of deep warm water which             
              is otherwise blocked by the shallow sills in the strait.
