Abstract    :
              This study is a comparison and evaluation of the modern arctic                 
              climate as simulated by seven general circulation models (GCM).                
              While most GCM's project an amplified climatic response in polar               
              regions to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases, the                  
              responses of individual models vary, and appear to depend to some              
              extent on the formulation of the model.  The objective of the                  
              intercomparison study is to identify the common biases for all                 
              seven models, and the differences in biases among models with                  
              respect to such climatic simulations as sea-level pressure,                    
              temperature, precipitation, storm tracks, clouds, and radiation                
              exchange.  Model performance will be constrained with existing data            
              sets whenever feasible.                                                        
                                                                                             
              The GCM's to be evaluated are those developed by the National                  
              Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR CCM2), the European Centre               
              for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF), the Geophysical Fluid            
              Dynamics Laboratory of NOAA (GFDL), the Goddard Institute for Space            
              Studies of NASA (GISS), the Numerical Weather Center of NOAA (NMC),            
              the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), and the United               
              Kingdom Meteorological Office (UKMO).  Computation time will be
