Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Production of offspring in plants can involve pollen                           
              produced within the same plant or pollen from other                            
              plants.  The balance between these two modes has a                             
              profound influence on the distribution of genetic                              
              variation in the population and also its evolutionary                          
              dynamics.  The proposed research will examine the                              
              extent to which individuals in a natural population                            
              reproduce via self-pollen, and examine the relative                            
              importance of several factors that favor low to                                
              moderate levels of self-pollination.  These include a                          
              decline in fitness of offspring derived from self-                             
              pollination relative to those that result from cross-                          
              pollination and the potential for competition between                          
              self and cross pollen.                                                         
                                                                                             
              Agriculturally important traits are often selected                             
              through breeding programs that involve many generations                        
              of self-pollination.  In some cases, lines of                                  
              agricultural plants have been selected for their                               
              propensity to self-pollinate since this prevents the                           
              dilution of desirable genetic traits by genes from                             
              unselected plants.  The genetic implications of imposing                       
              higher than usual rates of self-pollination on plants                          
              are poorly understood.  The proposed research will                             
              investigate some effects of self-pollination and                               
              contribute to our understanding of long term                                   
              agricultural selection programs.
