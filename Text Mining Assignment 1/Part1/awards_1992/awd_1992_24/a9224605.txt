Abstract    :
                9224605  Grossman    SDB:  Computing with Persistent Stores of Scientific
              Objects    This is the first year funding of a three-year continuing award.  
              The objective of this project is to develop technology to enable  scientists to
              make computationally intensive queries on very large  amounts of data in an
              object store.  The project consists of three  closely related parts.  The first
              part of the project consists of  developing algorithms to store, access, and
              analyze objects  distributed in a hierarchical storage system.  The second part
              of  the project consists of developing a suite of software tools for  working
              with objects distributed in a hierarchical storage system.   The third part of
              the project consists of using these tools to  create and analyze several
              stores, including: an EventStore -- a  store of proton collisions (events)
              generated by counter rotating  proton beams in a particle collider and
              registered by a variety of  sophisticated electronic equipment; a
              TrajectoryStore -- a store of  trajectory segments describing possible flight
              paths of aircraft  modeled by nonlinear systems; and a VortexStore -- a store
              of  vortex solutions of modified Navier-Stokes equations.  As a result  of this
              project, scientists will be able to analyze data with  object stores, even when
              the size of the data requires that the  majority of the data reside in tertiary
              storage.   ***
