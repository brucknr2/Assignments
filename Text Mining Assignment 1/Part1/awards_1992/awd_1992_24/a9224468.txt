Abstract    :
              Professor Goff of the University of Iowa will attempt to                       
              catalyze the dioxygenation of aromatic compounds with support                  
              from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic program.                  
              The attempt is motivated by the existence of metalloenzymes                    
              that perform this feat.  Goff will investigate hemes, manganese                
              porphyrins, and non-porphyrin iron and manganese compounds for                 
              their ability to catalyze the introduction of both atoms of an                 
              oxygen molecule across adjacent atoms of aromatic rings.  He                   
              will use porphyrin compounds that are known to coordinate                      
              peroxide in a side-on configuration, and he will tune the                      
              reactivity by altering the substituents on the porphyrin                       
              periphery.  Paramagnetic NMR will play an important role in                    
              assessing the effects of these substituents.  Success in this                  
              endeavor would add a major new dimension to abiological                        
              oxidation chemistry.                                                           
              %%%                                                                            
              Dioxygenases are naturally-occurring enzymes that catalyze                     
              reactions of molecular oxygen with aromatic organic compounds                  
              such that both oxygen atoms become bound to the organic                        
              product.  Reactions of this type are unknown in synthetic                      
              chemistry, but are potentially of great value.  A concerted                    
              effort to develop such reactivity will be conducted, and it                    
              will be guided by current insight regarding the bonding of O2                  
              to certain metal-containing compounds.  It is considered that                  
              by bonding to the metal center, the properties of O2 will be                   
              sufficiently altered that it will react as though a dioxygenase                
              enzyme were present.
