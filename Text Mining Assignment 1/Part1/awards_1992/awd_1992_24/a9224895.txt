Abstract    :
              This Small Grant for Exploratory Research is made by the                       
              Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program to support                 
              the development of a new method for determining the symmetry                   
              and geometry of gas phase transition metal carbonyl anions.                    
              Dr. Steven W. Buckner of the Chemistry Department, University                  
              of Arizona, will construct a CO laser that will cover                          
              wavelengths in the range 1600 to 2000 inverse centimeters.                     
              This will enable detailed examination of the C-O stretching                    
              bands of various complexes.  The experiment will be a new                      
              application of wavelength dependent infrared multiphoton                       
              dissociation (IRMPD) spectroscopy.  In addition to  providing a                
              new structural probe of these species, should the early phases                 
              of this work be successful, light-driven bimolecular reactions                 
              of some organometallic ions would be investigated.  Detailed                   
              mechanisms of complex gas phase photochemical reactions could                  
              thus be determined.                                                            
              %%%                                                                            
              Full understanding of gas phase organometallic chemistry                       
              requires investigation of both  structural changes and                         
              energetics during the course of reactions.  Here a novel                       
              experimental approach to obtaining such important information                  
              is proposed.  Because difficulties with sensitivity of the                     
              method and rearrangement of the reactants could limit its                      
              utility, the research is supported by a small exploratory                      
              award.  If successful, however, the method would be helpful in                 
              understanding photochemical and catalytic processes.
