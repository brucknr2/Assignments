Abstract    :
                   Several recent reports converge on the need for an National               
              Center for Ecological Synthesis and Analysis.  The PIs will run a              
              workshop, sponsored jointly by the Ecological Society of America               
              and the Association of Ecosystem Research Centers, to assess and               
              summarize the ideas of ecologists about such a center.  The                    
              workshop is designed to sample a broad spectrum of ecologists and              
              deliver a summary report to NSF in timely fashion.  Major goals                
              are to (1) identify the kinds of questions that can only or best               
              be addressed by such a center, questions that are impossible or                
              very difficult to solve under extant mechanisms; and (2) identify              
              and assess possible alternative administrative structures for                  
              such a center.
