Abstract    :
                   This award is concerned with research in two areas of                     
              noncommutative ring theory.  The principal investigator will                   
              study the semiprimitivity of group algebras.  The main goal is to              
              work on the locally finite case and on some aspects of the more                
              difficult finitely generated case.  In addition, he will work on               
              developing delta methods in enveloping algebras of color Lie                   
              algebras and on understanding the relationship between H-Galois                
              actions of finite dimensional Hopf algebras and the irreducible                
              representations of these Hopf algebras.  Finally, he plans to                  
              work on quantum enveloping algebras to see whether the enveloping              
              algebra delta methods can be extended to yield properties of                   
              these rings which do not follow from the usual Noetherian                      
              techniques.                                                                    
                   This research is in the general area of ring theory.  A ring              
              is an algebraic object having both an addition and a                           
              multiplication defined on it.  Although the additive operation                 
              satisfies the commutative law, the multiplicative operation is                 
              not required to do so.  An example of a ring for which                         
              multiplication is not commutative is the collection of nxn                     
              matrices over the integers.  The study of noncommutative rings                 
              has become an important part of algebra because of its increasing              
              significance to other branches of mathematics and physics.
