Abstract    :
              The primary thrust of this investigation is the development of                 
              radiative transfer codes for cumulus and stratocumulus cloud fields            
              which simulate realistic 3-D cloudiness.  To date almost all                   
              studies of inhomogeneous cloud fields reported in the literature               
              have assumed cubic clouds arrayed in checkerboard patterns.                    
              However, real cumulus clouds can be approximated as parabolic                  
              ellipsoids in shape with the cloud surfaces approximated with a                
              fractional Brownian (fractal) model.  Furthermore, cloud fields are            
              clustered rather than regularly distributed.  The intent of this               
              investigation is to model cloud field radiative properties with                
              these realistic cloud properties.                                              
                                                                                             
              There are three components to this study:                                      
              1) Cloud will be modeled using realistic cloud 3-D parameters.                 
                                                                                             
              2) Radiative transfer models will be constructed to simulate real              
              cumulus and stratocumulus cloud fields over 30 km x 30 km regions.             
                                                                                             
              3) Cloud optical property retrievals will be made for selected                 
              cumulus and stratocumulus cloud fields using FIRE field                        
              Observations.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              The basic premise guiding this research effort is that effective               
              cloud radiative parameterizations can be constructed as we gain a              
              more complete understanding of the impact of brokenness upon the               
              cloud radiative properties.                                                    
                                                                                             
              This research is important for a fundamental understanding of                  
              climate and climate feedback processes.
