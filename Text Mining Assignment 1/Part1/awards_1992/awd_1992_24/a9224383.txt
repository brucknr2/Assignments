Abstract    :
              This award supports a continuing program of permafrost monitoring              
              in Alaska that began in 1977.  Temperature measurements of the                 
              air, the active layer, and the permafrost will be recorded at                  
              several sites by automated data logging systems.  The physical                 
              state of permafrost is a very sensitive indicator of long term                 
              changes in surface temperature and also is an important parameter              
              for climate models.  Permafrost monitoring is crucial to                       
              understanding the processes of interaction between soil,                       
              groundwater, and the atmosphere.
