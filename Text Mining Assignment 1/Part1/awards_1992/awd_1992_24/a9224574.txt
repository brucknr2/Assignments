Abstract    :
              9224574  Maradudin    This two-year award supports U.S.-U.K. cooperative
              research in  condensed matter physics.  The investigators are Alexei Maradudin 
              and Richard Wallace of the University of California at Irvine,  and Alan D.
              Boardman of the University of Salford in the United  Kingdom.  The research
              encompasses theoretical investigations of  the propagation of nonlinear
              electromagnetic waves in magnetic  and magneto-optic layered structures. 
              Emphasis will be placed on  layered structures that exhibit effective
              nonlinearity.     The study of nonlinear waves has important applications in 
              optical computing and signal processing, particularly in the  development of
              improved magnetic and magneto-optic materials.    The proposed collaboration
              will advance our knowledge of the role  of nonlinear waves in a range of
              materials and their use as  waveguides.  The project integrates the theoretical
              and  experimental approaches.  The U.S. investigators bring to this 
              collaboration expertise in nonlinear physics, surface magneto- 
              plasmonpolaritons, surface acoustic waves and waves in magnetic  materials. 
              This is complemented by the British investigator's  expertise in guided waves. 
              The project also takes advantage of  British experiments on the properties of
              magnetic and magneto-  optic materials.  ***
