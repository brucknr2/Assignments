Abstract    :
              This award supports a program to study sediment cores from the                 
              Hudson Strait, which is widely believed to have been the drainage              
              path for a major part of the Laurentide Ice Sheet.  The goals are              
              to understand the dynamic processes associated with the last                   
              stages of collapse of this marine based ice sheet.  The project                
              will use oxygen isotopes, carbon-14 ages, benthic foraminifera,                
              and sediment provenance studies to develop a history of the                    
              changing paleoenvironmental conditions during the time that the                
              Laurentide Ice Sheet was deteriorating.
