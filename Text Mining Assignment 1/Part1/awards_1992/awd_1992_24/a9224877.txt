Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Fundamental studies of the dependence of the InAlAs/InP band                   
              offset on strain will be conducted by measuring photoluminescence              
              from the Type II staggered InAlAs/InP interface as a function of               
              pressure using a diamond anvil cell.  The interplay between the                
              deleterious effects of interface roughness introduced by atomic                
              exchange of  arsenic and phosphorus, and the benefits produced by              
              strain will be explored; it is anticipated that the ability to                 
              tune the strain through the use of hydrostatic pressure will                   
              provide fundamental information on the nature of this unique                   
              material.                                                                      
              %%%                                                                            
              Research will be conducted on the factors that influence the                   
              electronic and optical properties of a particular compound                     
              semiconductor material combination with potential advantages in                
              electronics and photonics applications.  This research is                      
              expected to give a fundamental understanding of the effect of                  
              strain on basic material properties and performance.  The                      
              semiconductor material combination under study has wide                        
              applicability in electronic and optoelectronic devices;                        
              understanding the effects of strain on electronic and optical                  
              properties is also expected to improve the performance of                      
              advanced devices and integrated circuits used in computing,                    
              information processing, and telecommunications.
