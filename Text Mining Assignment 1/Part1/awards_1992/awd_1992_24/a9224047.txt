Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The PI's request funding to purchase 1)a CHN autoanalyzer with                 
              autosampler capabilities and 2) a coulometrics-based total carbon              
              analysis system.  The instruments will be operated as shared-use               
              instruments available to researchers at the University.  They will             
              support a wide variety of NSF-funded research in oceanography and              
              marine sciences including biology, chemistry, geology and                      
              biogeochemistry.  The University is providing one third of the                 
              costs as matching funds.
