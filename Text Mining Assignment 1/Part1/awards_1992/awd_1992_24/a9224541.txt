Abstract    :
              9224541  Wang       This project addresses the problem of pole assignment by 
              output feedback with dynamic compensation. Its goals are to find  the minimal
              order among real dynamic compensators needed for  arbitrary pole assignability
              and to derive a formula for the  degree of the Rosenthal compactification of
              dynamic compensator  space. Techniques involving the Schubert calculus
              developed by  the principal investigator in solving the static output feedback 
              pole assignment problem are expected to be important in the study  of the
              minimal order dynamic compensator problem.        The poles of a linear system
              determine its frequencies and  amplitudes of vibration, and their locations
              determine whether or  not the system is stable. Therefore, in control design
              for a  physical system such as an airplane or robot arm, a major  objective is
              to move the poles of the plant into its stability  region, i.e., a region where
              the principle modes of vibration die  out at a prescribed rate, using output
              feedback. Output feedback  usually involves a dynamic compensator and the
              higher the order  of that compensator, the more complicated the controller
              needed  to shift the poles becomes.Therefore, it is important to be able  to
              design minimal order dynamic compensators. This project will  brings the method
              of algebraic geometry to bear on this problem.  ***
