Abstract    :
                   The aim of the project is to explore mathematically                       
              interesting probability questions arising directly or indirectly               
              from the study of algorithms and combinatorics.  One aspect                    
              concerns weak convergence methods for studying size-asymptotics                
              of random combinatorial objects.  Another aspect is a study of                 
              random walk in random environment on trees as a simple case of                 
              the Metropolis algorithm.  A third part concerns algorithmic                   
              aspects of Bayesian posteriors on probability distributions given              
              i.i.d. data, where we take a nonparametric prior derived from                  
              superprocess excursion.  Random trees occur in various guises                  
              throughout the proposal.                                                       
                   One part of the project is a theoretical study of how to                  
              approximate large random discrete structures by continuous                     
              structures, in contexts where such an approximation is rather                  
              subtle.  Another part is a theoretical study of the most                       
              widely-used algorithm for computer simulation of complicated                   
              random objects, in a simplified setting.  A final part is the                  
              development of sophisticated algorithms for updating statistical               
              estimates of spatial distributions as more data becomes                        
              available.
