Abstract    :
              This is one of four coordinated projects that will make use of the             
              camp facilities established on the ice sheet in the interior of                
              Greenland as part of the GISP-2 ice core drilling effort, in order             
              to investigate how atmospheric trace elements are deposited on the             
              ice and what kind of changes they undergo as they are being                    
              incorporated into the ice.  An understanding of such processes is              
              necessary in order to properly interpret the proxy climate data                
              that can be recovered from ice cores.  While significant progress              
              has been made recently in extracting and analyzing ice cores,                  
              progress in understanding the air to snow transfer process for                 
              reactive chemical species has lagged behind.                                   
                                                                                             
              The goal of this project is to determine the atmosphere to snow                
              transfer function for chemical species whose deposition is                     
              reversible, i.e. ones that can move from the snow back into the                
              atmosphere to be removed or redeposited elsewhere.  The two species            
              to be investigated are hydrogen peroxide and formaldehyde.  Based              
              on measurements of their concentration in the free atmosphere, in              
              the air within the snow, as well as in snow, and ice, a transfer               
              model will be developed.  Concurrent laboratory studies will be                
              done to determine and constrain model parameters such as chemical              
              equilibrium coefficients and mass transfer coefficients.  The model            
              will be generalized to other reactive species, such as nitric acid,            
              and organic acids.
