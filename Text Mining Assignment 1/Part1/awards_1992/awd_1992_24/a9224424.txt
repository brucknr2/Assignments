Abstract    :
              Parks         The objective of this research is to develop procedures for  the
              design of optimum multirate digital filters. The criterion  used for optimality
              is derived from the norm of a linear operator  that represents the filter. When
              applied to the design of linear,  time-invariant filters this measure of
              optimality reduces to the  usual Chebyshev frequency domain error criterion. 
              For  multirate-systems, this approach leads to a new criterion for  filter
              optimality. This provides a quantitative, analytic design  procedure that
              yields better filters than intuitive design  methods that are in common use.   
                   The methods for the development of appropriate error  functions use
              techniques from singular value decomposition and  analysis of periodically
              time-varying linear systems. The  development of efficient design algorithms is
              based on  semi-infinite programming and Remez-like multiple exchange  methods. 
                     This research is expected to establish limits for  performance of
              multirate filters as well as to provide improved  filters.  Present designs can
              be compared with the best  attainable to determine possible improvements.
