Abstract    :
               In this project by Prof. David Pratt of the University of                     
              Pittsburgh, the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry                    
              Division supports experimental research on fundamental                         
              questions concerning the structures and forces at work in                      
              weakly bound complexes, mechanisms of intramolecular energy                    
              flow, and chemical reaction pathways.  By means of high                        
              resolution ultraviolet spectroscopy the properties of excited                  
              electronic states are determined and questions of the dynamics                 
              of chemical reactions are addressed.

              Understanding the fundamentals of chemical reactions on a                      
              molecular level is at the current frontier of physical                         
              chemistry.  Once a molecule is enriched with high vibrational                  
              and electronic energy, it can shed this energy in a                            
              reactionless process, it can dissociate into fragments, or it                  
              can react with other molecules to form new ones.  If the                       
              details of these individual processes are known and understood,                
              reactions could be steered into preferred directions.  The                     
              determination of such detailed, molecular level understanding                  
              for species of chemical interest is the goal of this research                  
              project.
