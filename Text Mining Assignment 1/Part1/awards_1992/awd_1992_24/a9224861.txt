              By bringing together a wide range of scholars, this conference will raise the
              level of theoretical discussion about Islam, identity, modernity, the state,
              and transnationalism in Southeast Asia by focusing upon the relation between
              Islam and identity of Southeast Asian Muslims.  Throughout Southeast Asia, the
              development of the modern state, capitalis m, education, the media, and other
              institutions of modernity have altered the bases of Islamic social communities.
               These socio economic changes have engendered a crisis of tradition that is
              characterized by what Geertz calls "a struggle to define the real".  This
              struggle is a self conscious and sustained effort to construct a sense of self
              and create new moral boundaries around communities.          The crisis of
              tradition, the social reconstruction of community, and modern reinterpretations
              of Islam were themes that concerned an earlier generation of Southeast Asian
              scholars.  Much of this early scholarship, however, failed to appreciate the
              depth of changes that societies were undergoing and the extraordinary vitality
              of Muslim communities.  Though many scholars predicted that Islamic
              revitalization was nothing more than a temporary phenomenon that was likely to
              give way to the inexorable forces of modernization and secularization, the
              political and moral force of Islam in South Asian has not diminished.  Instead
              Islam in Southeast has embarked on a new phase of intensive development. 
              Conference participants will examine the social form and cultural meanings of
              this vitalization to understand the ways Southeast Asian Muslims use Islam to
              construct their identities in contexts of modernity and the nation state. ***
