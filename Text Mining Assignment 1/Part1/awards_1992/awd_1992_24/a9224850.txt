Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT---CTS-9224850  Lavernia  Metal matrix composites (MMCs) have the
              potential combining metallic properties of ductility, toughness, and
              environmental resistance with reinforcement properties of high strength and
              high modules.  The attractive physical and mechanical properties that can be
              obtained with metal matrix composites have been documented by numerous
              investigators.  As will be demonstrated in this proposal, despite encouraging
              preliminary results, our understandings of the thermal mechanisms that govern
              the interactions between the ceramic and metallic phases remain very limited. 
              In particular, the effects associated with the energetic co-injection of a
              distribution of ceramic particulates into a partially solidified metallic
              spray, and its ensuing effects on the heat transfer during atomization and
              subsequently during deposition are not well understood.  The objective of the
              present proposal is to outline a research program to systematically investigate
              the thermal effects of ceramic particulates on the evolution of microstructure
              during spray co-deposition of metal matrix composites.
