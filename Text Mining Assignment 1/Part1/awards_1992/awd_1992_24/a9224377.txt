Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of this research is to investigate atomic structures,                 
              defects, vacancies, and chemical reactions on surfaces induced by              
              atoms/ionss with thermal energies up to several hundred eV as a                
              function of ion kinetic energy and substrate temperature.  Thermal             
              atomic beams are produced by effusion cells while ion beams are                
              generated by a new pulsed, mass-selected, low-energy ion beam                  
              system.  In situ structural analysis are conducted by Time-Of-                 
              Flight Scattering and Recoiling Spectrometry and Low Energy                    
              Electron Diffraction.  In situ X-ray and UV photoelectron and Auger            
              spectroscopy (PS, UPS and AES) and conventional ex situ structural             
              analysis methods such as x-ray diffraction, Rutherford                         
              backscattering, and transmission electron microscopy also are used             
              for material characterization.  Studies on ion trajectory                      
              simulations and molecular dynamics calculations augment structural             
              determinations and atomic scale processes in film growth.  These               
              studies are important because they enhance understanding of the                
              fundamental physical and chemical processes involved in low-energy             
              ion-surface interactions.  Also, the proposed synthetic routes have            
              potentials for growing unique, previously unknown materials because            
              of the judicious manipulation of the ion energy and substrate                  
              temperature.
