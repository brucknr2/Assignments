Abstract    :
                   This is the first year of a three-year continuing award.  The             
              research explores computer vision for recognition of three-                    
              dimensional curved objects.  A new technique for object modeling               
              and recognition will be developed, based on representing objects by            
              discrete meshes of points, and mapping of the meshes to a spherical            
              representation.  The algorithms developed in this project reduce               
              the problem of matching and pose determination to one of finding               
              the best rotation between two spherical maps. This is done without             
              using any combinatorial search. These algorithms lead to a robust              
              and computationally deterministic approach to object recognition.              
              By removing most of the shape constraints imposed by conventional              
              methods, they make object recognition possible in a wider range of             
              applications.  Finally, by allowing for shape matching in the                  
              presence of occlusions, they remove a major limitation of existing             
              approaches based on spherical representations.
