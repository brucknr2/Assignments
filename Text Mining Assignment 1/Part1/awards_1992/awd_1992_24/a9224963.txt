Abstract    :

              Accurate,  low-computational-cost recognition of 3D objects having highly- 
              variable curved surfaces, or of the membership class of an object,  or of a
              deformable object, have been among the research topics most  resistant to
              satisfactory solution, and yet are necessary if  reasonably general practical
              machine vision is to become a reality.   This research explores solutions to
              these problems based on the  unified use of patches of 3D surfaces and space
              curves modeled by  high-degree implicit polynomials, algebraic invariants,
              probability  distributions on the coefficient vectors for the polynomials, and 
              asymptotic minimum probability of error (i.e., Bayesian)  recognizers.  The
              implicit polynomial curves and surfaces are  generalizations of quadrics, and
              have much greater representation  power than do quadrics or superquadrics. The
              algebraic invariants  are functions of the polynomial coefficients having
              values that do  not change when the data is translated, rotated or scaled 
              differently in two different directions (i.e., an affine  transformation). 
              Among the intended applications are service  robots that must recognize and
              handle materials and parts, service  robots or machine vision systems that must
              interact with people,  and parts inspection for manufacturing automation.  The
              techniques  to be used have received very little attention in the research 
              literature, but now are the subject of growing interest.
