Abstract    :
              9224795  Hayden  The purpose of this work is to prepare and study
              photorefractive polymeric waveguides.  Photoconducting properties such as,
              carrier drift mobility and generation efficiency, will be determined through
              time of flight and xerographic studies.  Dielectric relaxation studies will be
              performed and recombination coefficients will also be determined.  Two beam
              coupling, a clear indicator of the photorefractive effect, will be studied in
              novel guided wave structures.  ***
