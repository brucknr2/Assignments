Abstract    :
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work of              
              Professor Gellman at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. This                
              study will investigate the conformation-directing effects of                   
              intramolecular hydrogen bonds that are relevant to protein folding             
              by 1H NMR and IR spectroscopic methods. The specific topics of study           
              are: the intrinsic stability of isolated alpha-helical turns, the              
              postulated helix-initiating role of N-terminal proline residues,               
              the intrinsic stability of beta-hairpins, conformation-specifying              
              effects of ionic peptide appendages, mechanisms of cooperativity               
              among intramolecular hydrogen bonds, and the conformation-directing            
              role of nonpolar-nonpolar interactions (including the hydrophobic              
              effect) in aqueous solution.                                                   
              %%%                                                                            
              The results from Professor Samuel H. Gellman's spectroscopic                   
              studies will contribute significantly to our understanding of                  
              protein folding. The importance of his work is the determination of            
              thermodynamic parameters to assess the relative contributions of               
              hydrophobicity and hydrogen bonding to peptide and protein                     
              stability.
