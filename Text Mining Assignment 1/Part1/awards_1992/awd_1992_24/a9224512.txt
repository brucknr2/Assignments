Abstract    :
              9224512  Orville       This award would provide additional equipment to expand
              an  existing computer system to analyze and provide interactive student  access
              to weather data to five student workstations.  This will  include facilities
              for displaying current weather data products and  making them available to
              workstations in a classroom environment.   This award will also allow for an
              improved commitment to the  UNIDATA program and the school will share and
              exchange ideas and  programming expertise with others in this program.  ***
