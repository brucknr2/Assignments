Abstract    :
                   This award is for partial support of an "International                    
              Symposium on 30 years of Neutral Currents" to be held on the                   
              UCLA campus.  Participation is international in scope.  About                  
              65 - 80 scientists are expected to attend.  The subject matter                 
              is a mix of historical reminiscence, review of current status                  
              and prospects for future developments in this sector of                        
              electroweak physics.
