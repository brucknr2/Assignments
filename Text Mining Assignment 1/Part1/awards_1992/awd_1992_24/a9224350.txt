Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The recent revelation of apparent extremely large-scale                        
              structure in the cosmic microwave background has led to new                    
              efforts to evaluate the structure in the universe.  The                        
              research activities to be supported under this grant will be                   
              involved in tracing out such structure.                                        
                                                                                             
              Rich clusters of galaxies are efficient samplers of the                        
              scales of interest.  Recent analyses of clusters from                          
              Abell's (1958) and the new Abell, Corwin, and Olowin (1989)                    
              catalog of southern rich clusters reveal evidence of three                     
              dimensional superclustering.  However, redshifts have been                     
              measured for less than 25% of these clusters, and the                          
              present knowledge of the three dimensional distribution of                     
              these clusters has some uncertainties.                                         
                                                                                             
              These uncertainties will be significantly reduced by this                      
              work, which will obtain redshifts of over 300 of these                         
              clusters, so that a deeper, more complete and reliable                         
              sample is available for studies of large-scale structure.
