Abstract    :
              9224546  Marker    This three-year award for U.S.-United Kingdom cooperative 
              research in mathematics involves David E. Marker, C. Ward Henson,  Lou van den
              Dries of the Chicago and Urbana-Champaign campuses of  the University of
              Illinois respectively, and Angus Macintyre,  Alex Wilkie, Kobi Peterzil of
              Oxford University's Mathematics  Institute.  The objectives of the research is
              to apply complex  analytical methods to model theory in exponentiation and O- 
              minimal expansions of R.  Model theoretical results obtained so  fair show that
              subsets of R definable exponentiation behave in  many ways like semialgebraic
              and subanalytic subsets.  The investigators will study finer definability and
              growth rate  questions of R and extend their results to natural expansions 
              allowing further analytical structure.    This collaboration takes advantage of
              the complementary expertise  of the Oxford and University of Illinois research
              groups.  Both  have worked extensively on model theory and analysis interface, 
              exponentiation, and study of complex function defined in  exponential terms. 
              Since exponentially defined semialgebraic and  subanalytic sets arise naturally
              in many mathematical and  engineering fields, this research will advance
              understanding of  their uses in real algebraic and real analytic geometry, 
              dynamical systems, control theory, statistics and robotics.  ***
