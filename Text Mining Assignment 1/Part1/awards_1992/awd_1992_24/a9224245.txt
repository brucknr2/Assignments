Abstract    :
              9224245  Glass  This Americas Award will support collaborative  research between
              Drs. Jonathan Glass, Louisiana  State Medical Center, and M. T. Nunez Gonzalez,
               University of Chile, on the exploration of the  cellular mechanism of iron
              uptake.  The focus of  this research is on the biochemical analysis of the 
              events required for iron delivery from transferrin,  with the ultimate aim of
              elucidating the  mechanism  of iron transport.      The laboratory on the
              Chilean side will focus on  utilizing rabbit reticulocytes to obtain detailed 
              analyses of iron mobilization via the regulation of  vesicular pH by ionic
              fluxes, while the laboratory  of the principal investigator will determine 
              mobilization rates as a function of ionic  composition and membrane potential. 
              Results of the  research will contribute to a better understanding  of the
              fundamental aspects of human cellular  metabolism.  ***
