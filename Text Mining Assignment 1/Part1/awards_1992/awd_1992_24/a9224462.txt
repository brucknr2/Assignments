Abstract    :
              Somani         This is a project to mitigate the effects of transient  faults in
              redundant computer systems that use cache memories.   Redundant computer
              systems typically employ a voting circuit as  part of the processor-memory
              interface to check for consistency  in all bus transactions.  If cache memories
              are used, many  operations do not use the processor-memory interface, and so 
              escape the scrutiny of the voter.  In this project new cache  protocols are
              being designed that provide for fault tolerance in  redundant systems.  The new
              protocols require the cache  controllers to broadcast the contents of cache
              lines on occasion,  and require cache controllers to respond to requests from
              the  memory system to replace erroneous data.  The project covers the 
              development, analysis, and application of fault-tolerant cache  protocols.
