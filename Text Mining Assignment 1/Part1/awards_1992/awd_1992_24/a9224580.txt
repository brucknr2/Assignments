Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              PROGRAM:   Oceanographic Instrumentation                                       
                                                                                             
              The University of Rhode Island (URI) requests funding to purchase              
              shipboard instrumentation in support of NSF-funded research.  The              
              instruments will be used aboard the research vessel ENDEAVOR, a 177            
              foot vessel, that is owned by NSF and operated by URI.  All of the             
              instruments are for shared-use by a wide variety of scientists.                
              The PI will use the funds to puchase a fume hood, equipment racks,             
              thermal recorders, a data wiring system, and upgrades for the                  
              CTD's.
