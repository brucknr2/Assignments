Abstract    :
              Few events are as traumatic, in both personal and corporate terms,             
              as layoffs.  This project explores how workers view the causes of              
              their job loss and how they decide whether they have suffered                  
              wrongful or discriminatory treatment.  The project expands the                 
              study of decisions about suing by looking at claiming decisions                
              with respect to past employers.  The study will test a number of               
              theories of litigation behavior, focusing particularly on how                  
              feelings of fair or unfair treatment by the former employer affects            
              the decision to make a wrongful termination claim.  By helping us              
              to understand the psychological and social processes involved in               
              claiming decisions, the study will contribute to our understanding             
              of how everyday notions of fair treatment affect the movement of               
              cases into the legal system.                                                   
                                                                                             
              This collaborative study will include interviews of 1075 recently              
              fired or laid-off workers recruited at state unemployment offices.             
              The interviews will explore a variety of factors thought to                    
              contribute to the decision to sue, including pre-termination                   
              treatment, financial burdens of unemployment, awareness of claiming            
              options, and feelings of discrimination.  Follow-up interviews with            
              some of the workers will be used to determine who actually                     
              initiated wrongful termination claims.
