Abstract    :
              Theoretical research will be conducted on the properties of Fermi              
              systems where the interparticle interactions or the lack of                    
              translational invariance gives rise to qualitatively new effects.              
              The work is relevant to many systems of current experimental                   
              interest such as heavy Fermion compounds, liquid Helium three near             
              solidification, high temperature superconductors, doped                        
              semiconductors, amorphous alloys and alkali-doped Fullerenes.  The             
              understanding of the thermodynamics and the transport properties of            
              strongly interacting electrons in amorphous and crystalline solids             
              is relevant to basic science and will ultimately lead to the design            
              of technologically useful materials.

              Theoretical research will be done on the behavior of electrons                 
              which interact strongly with each other.  This is a very                       
              fundamental problem which remains unsolved.  However, its solution             
              will have major impacts on a variety of materials including the                
              high temperature superconductors and the newly discovered                      
              superconducting Fullerenes.
