Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is a study of social networks and community response to              
              a natural disaster.  It will survey officials and a random sample              
              of residents in an area of South Louisiana recently devastated by              
              hurricane Andrew, to learn the roles played by informal and                    
              formal social structures in shaping individuals' actions before,               
              during, and immediately after the storm.  In particular,                       
              individuals in highly dense networks are predicted to behave very              
              differently from those in more extensive networks, for example in              
              how quickly they evacuated their homes.  Furthermore, individuals              
              may use different portions of their social network to seek                     
              different kinds of aid.  The study employs well-developed                      
              techniques for collecting network data, and it will analyze them               
              with appropriate statistical methods.                                          
                                                                                             
                   The hurricane offers a practically unique opportunity to                  
              examine human behavior under extreme conditions, extending the                 
              knowledge social scientists have gained in research on more usual              
              conditions.  Well grounded in standard sociological theory, this               
              study promises significant scientific gains.  But it also will                 
              offer insights to help community leaders communicate and provide               
              social services more effectively in times of crisis.
