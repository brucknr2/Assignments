Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Research will focus on how genetic variation is                                
              distributed in natural populations of a filamentous                            
              mold, Aspergillus nidulans, and how it propagates                              
              itself in nature.  Molds like A. nidulans can produce                          
              clonal propagules called spores that are genetically                           
              exactly identical to their single parent.  Or, they can                        
              produce spores that are a genetic mixture of the two                           
              parents.  This research distinguish will between these                         
              two events by surveying genetic variation in natural                           
              populations.  Genetic markers have been identified that                        
              are variable between individuals in nature.  If only                           
              distinct combinations of markers are observed in any                           
              given individual, then reproduction is clonal.                                 
              However, if some individuals have markers that are                             
              combinations of those seen in others, then sexual                              
              reproduction occurs.                                                           
                                                                                             
              The Aspergilli are an important group of organisms.                            
              Many Aspergilli and their relatives are used to produce                        
              a variety of useful substances, such as antibiotics.                           
              Aspergillus flavus commonly grows on stored grain                              
              products, producing a powerful carcinogen called                               
              aflatoxin, a threat to livestock and humans.                                   
              Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus parasiticus can                          
              be human pathogens, commonly lethally infecting immune-                        
              compromised individuals.  While Aspergillus nidulans                           
              isn't a pathogen, it is a well-developed research                              
              organism, with tools for genetic analysis available                            
              that are not developed in other species.  Information                          
              about its population structure and how it propagates in                        
              nature should provide useful clues about the life                              
              histories of other molds.
