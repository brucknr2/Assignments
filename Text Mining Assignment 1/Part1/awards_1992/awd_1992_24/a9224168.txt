Abstract    :
              9224168  Clark    This award is to start a new Materials Research Group at the 
              University of Colorado at Boulder on the topic of  ferroelectric liquid
              crystals.  The research is organized in  three main activities:  synthesis of
              new materials,  fundamental physics of ferroelectric liquid crystals,  and 
              modeling of the molecular structure and physical properties.  The synthesis
              activity includes making of new monomer,  polymer, and gel ferroelectric liquid
              crystals to explore  the molecular origins of particular property 
              characteristics, to test predictions from the modeling, and  to develop new
              electro-optic and nonlinear optical  materials.  The physics activity
              emphasizes evaluation of  the relevant physical properties of the materials,
              structure  of the phases, and dynamics of the phase transformations.  Included
              in this activity are x-ray scattering, optical  microscopy, time-dependent
              optical and vibrational  spectroscopy, molecular conformational dynamics,
              dielectric  relaxation, scanning tunneling microscopy, and optical 
              reflectivity.  The modeling activity includes molecular  dynamic simulations of
              molecular arrangements and  conformation, and calculation of measurable
              macroscopic  properties.    Ferroelectric liquid crystals offer exceptional
              capabilities  in electro-optic applications, such as electrically operated 
              light valves having microsecond response times, high  contrast intrinsic
              memory, low power consumption displays,  and nonlinear optical materials.  The
              materials research  group offers excellent educational opportunities for multi-
               disciplinary training of advanced students for research and  teaching.
