Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This US-Bulgaria project between Dr. Irwin                                     
              Fridovich and Dr. Stephan Liochev is on                                        
              "Oxidation Effects of the Superoxide Radical in                                
              Escherichia Coli."  The researchers propose a                                  
              novel explanation for the toxic effects of the                                 
              superoxide radical, to account for many                                        
              observations already in the literature which lend                              
              themselves to experimental probing.  Current                                   
              orthodoxy views superoxide as a precursor of                                   
              hydrogen peroxide and as a reductant for ferric                                
              ion.  The researchers, in contrast, view O2, O2                                
              and H2O2 as direct oxidants and consider Fe(II),                               
              in its various ligated forms, to be an important                               
              target for these oxidants.  They have found that                               
              a number of ?4Fe-4S!-containing dehydrases are                                 
              rapidly oxidatively inactivated by O2.  The                                    
              results should shed light on the mechanisms of                                 
              oxygen toxicity and of the oxygen-dependent                                    
              toxicities of viologens, quinones, aryl nitro                                  
              compounds and of other redox-active compounds.                                 
                                                                                             
              This project in biochemistry science fulfills the                              
              program objective of advancing scientific                                      
              knowledge by enabling leading experts in Bulgaria                              
              and the United States to combine complementary                                 
              talents and pool resources in areas of strong                                  
              mutual interest and competence.
