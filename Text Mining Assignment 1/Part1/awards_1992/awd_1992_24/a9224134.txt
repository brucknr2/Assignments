Abstract    :
              Professor John Verkade of Iowa State University will                           
              investigate "atrane" coordination compounds with support from                  
              the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program.  These                
              are highly symmetrical compounds with polycyclic alkoxide and                  
              amide-type ligands.  One class of compounds will place the                     
              metal center in a C3v environment with an axial amine.  The                    
              other class will be similar, but with a C2v (quasi-fourfold)                   
              environment.  Both transition metal and main-group metal                       
              centers will be used.  The initial studies will focus on                       
              synthesis of these interesting species.  Verkade will also                     
              conduct mechanistic studies of their transmetallations, axial                  
              ligand displacements, and other reactions.  An unusual                         
              technique to be employed will be 119Sn, 51V, and 73Ge NMR                      
              spectroscopy.                                                                  
              %%%                                                                            
              "Atranes" are an interesting class of compounds in which a                     
              central metal atom is bound symmetrically to three or four                     
              oxygen atoms in a plane, while a nitrogen atom is bound                        
              axially.  In such compounds the central metal can be                           
              systematically varied, as can other features of the molecules.                 
              Their high symmetry endows them with high volatility, which                    
              provides an unusual mechanism for transporting the central                     
              metal atom.  The synthesis of such compounds, as well as a                     
              study of their reactivity is the subject of the present grant.
