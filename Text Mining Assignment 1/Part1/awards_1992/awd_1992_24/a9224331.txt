              The PI's request funding to purchase shipboard instrumentation in              
              support of NSF-funded research.  The instrument will be used aboard            
              the R/V EWING, a 239 foot vessel, which is owned and operated by               
              the Observatory.  Funding provided through this grant will be used             
              to purchase a CTD & hydro-winch monitoring system which is a                   
              safety-related item that will benefit numerous cruises and decrease            
              the damage or loss of instruments.
