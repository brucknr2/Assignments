Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is a study of ethnic, social and political attitudes                 
              among youth in ten former republics of the Soviet Union.  It will              
              survey a probability sample frame of schools to assess the current             
              attitudes and conditions of youth and to design future studies of              
              social change and policy impact on this segment of society.  Topics            
              covered will include: strength of group identities, attitudes                  
              toward other nationalities, policy preferences on nationality                  
              issues, general political attitudes, and attitudes toward the                  
              commonwealth.                                                                  
                                                                                             
                   Social change and ethnic relations have long been among the               
              central topics for sociology, and thus this study will provide a               
              substantial new data base for testing many social-scientific                   
              hypotheses.  This research will contribute greatly to our                      
              understanding of the tremendous changes happening in the former                
              Soviet Union, and it will help scholars and policy makers                      
              comprehend the internal conflicts and international relations                  
              occurring among these newly independent states.
