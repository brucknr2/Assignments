Abstract    :
              The purpose of this post-disaster                                              
              study is to qualitatively and                                                  
              quantitatively identify and analyze                                            
              the structural debris generated                                                
              after Hurricane Andrew in relation                                             
              to the characteristics of the                                                  
              hurricane, the type of construction                                            
              and the land use in South Dade                                                 
              County.  In addition, the social,                                              
              technical and institutional                                                    
              problems encountered during the                                                
              removal and disposal of the                                                    
              structural debris caused by the                                                
              hurricane will be analyzed.  The                                               
              findings from this work will help                                              
              mitigate the magnitude and effects                                             
              of this type of debris produced by                                             
              extreme wind episodes.
