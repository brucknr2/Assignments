Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to document coastal and shallow                 
              marine response to Hurricane Andrew in south Florida.  Hurricane               
              Andrew was a major catastrophic  event that impacted a well-                   
              studied area.  This proposal requests funding to quickly document              
              critical sedimentologic  modifications that we have recognized.                
              Each need sampling and documentation before   evidence  is lost.               
              The effect of Hurricane Andrew was brief, intense and  with                    
              constantly shifting wind patterns.  There was little or no wind                
              more than 100 miles in advance of the storm.  This is in contrast              
              to previously documented Hurricanes Donna (1960), Betsy (1965) and             
              Inez (1966) that affected similar regions.  Andrew  provides the               
              opportunity to assess geologic response to this storm, as well as              
              contrast responses to the different   types of storm conditions of             
              each of the storms.  Geological modifications to the subtropical,              
              prevailing low energy environments of south Florida  were                      
              extensive.  Hurricane Andrew caused major modifications to land and            
              coastal wetland vegetation and expectable changes to shallow marine            
              and coastal environments.  Three observed    changes   from our                
              reconnaissance warrant careful documentation, as they are not well             
              recognized in the scientific literature but are of recognized                  
              significance in ancient deposits.  These  changes are: (1)                     
              reprofiling of quartz/carbonate barrier island beaches and dunes;              
              (2) gravel saltation in inland regions; and (3) tabular and tubular            
              tempestite stratification on carbonate mudbanks.
