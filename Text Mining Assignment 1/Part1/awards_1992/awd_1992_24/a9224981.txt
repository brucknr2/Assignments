Abstract    :
              Dr. Robert J. Doedens and other members of the Chemistry Department            
              of University of California at Irvine are being supported to                   
              continue a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in               
              Chemistry.  For the period 1993-5, eight undergraduate students                
              will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in a variety of              
              research projects.  Projects cover the traditional areas of                    
              chemistry-analytical, inorganic, organic, physical and                         
              biochemistry.  A unique feature of this program is the recruitment             
              of students from all parts of the country including under-                     
              represented groups.
