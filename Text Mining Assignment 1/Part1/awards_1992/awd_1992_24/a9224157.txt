Abstract    :
              This award provides partial support for a symposium entitled,                  
              "Molecular Genetics of Plant-Microbe Interactions," to be held on              
              April 21 - 24, 1993, at Rutgers University.  One of the topical                
              areas of plant biology research involves the molecular                         
              investigation of the interactions between plants and their                     
              parasitic and mutualistice microbes.  From these investigations,               
              insights into plant molecular biology and the molecular biology of             
              many types of microorganisms have been gained.  The study of the               
              molecular genetics of these interactions moves at such a rapid pace            
              that constant update is critical to keeping pace with the field.               
              This symposium is organized to provide a forum for such an update.             
              The symposium is divided into three types of sessions.  Formal                 
              presentations will be given by leaders in the field each morning               
              and early afternoon.  Workshops covering specific topics will be               
              held each afternoon, allowing for interactive discussions among                
              smaller groups of participants.  Finally, opportunity for other                
              meeting participants to present their results will be provided                 
              through poster sessions.  This meeting is international and                    
              multidisciplinary in scope, with authoritative speakers and                    
              workshop participants drawn from seven countries.  In addition to              
              the invitees of international stature, included in the program are             
              speakers and workshop participants who are more junior, but who                
              have already established high quality research programs.  This                 
              symposium is also structured to interest many, and be affordable               
              for young investigators.
