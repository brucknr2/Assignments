Abstract    :
                   Research into analytical and numerical stochastic                         
              optimization will be carried out. Specific problems to be                      
              analyzed include: near optimality of systems with wideband noise               
              and an unknown parameter process, approximation of optimal                     
              threshold values via stochastic optimization for manufacturing                 
              systems, sampling distributions of approximate error sequences in              
              least squares identification algorithms for distributed parameter              
              systems, and asymptotically optimal rates of convergence for                   
              smoothed stochastic approximation/optimization algorithms.                     
                   Many problems in manufacturing systems involve wideband                   
              noise and unknown parameter processes. Consequently, there is                  
              interest in understanding such stochastic processes from a                     
              mathematical point of view. By applying an optimal strategy to a               
              suitable approximation of the actual physical system, a near                   
              optimal policy will be developed. In many production planning                  
              problems, the optimal controls are described by certain threshold              
              values, which are easy to use for daily operation. However, the                
              choice of these values is often based on ad hoc considerations or              
              previous experience and in fact may be far from optimal. The                   
              second part of this research is concerned with designing a                     
              systematic way of finding the optimal threshold values.
