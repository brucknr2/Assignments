Abstract    :
              This award supports a program to perform paleomagnetic and stable              
              isotope measurements on deep-sea sediment cores from the Northwind             
              Ridge, Central Arctic Ocean.  This region appears to offer                     
              considerably higher sedimentation rates than most areas of the                 
              Arctic Ocean. Consequently, it offers a higher likelihood of                   
              success for producing a reliable magnetostratigraphic framework for            
              interpretation of a benthic-foraminifera based oxygen isotopic                 
              record.  This research will provide a valuable proxy climate record            
              for a part of the Arctic about which very little is known.
