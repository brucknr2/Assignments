Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is a study of the science and technology policies of six             
              American states that differ in the level of their industrialization            
              and the size of their science and technology base.  The                        
              investigators will conduct interviews and collect documents for                
              case study analysis of both antecedents and effects of policies in             
              New Jersey, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Washington, California, and              
              Rhode Island.  Hypotheses identify several factors that may favor              
              development of science and technology policy: predisposing                     
              structural conditions, economic transformation and stress, state               
              political capacity, business leaders, involvement of the mass                  
              public, and state governor initiative.  Factors that may oppose                
              development of science and technology policy are: individualistic              
              or traditional political culture, traditional businesses, labor                
              unions, minority and community groups, agricultural and rural                  
              interests, elements of the mass public, state legislators, and                 
              state economic development agencies.                                           
                                                                                             
                   This study will provide many insights of value for policy                 
              makers in the areas of science, technology and economic                        
              development.  It will also contribute to our understanding of                  
              regional differences within the United States, and to the role that            
              central institutions of society play in determining state's                    
              responses to the challenges and opportunities created by rapidly-              
              changing science and technology.
