Abstract    :
              9224686  Thummel  The focus of this research is the demonstration that carefully
               designed receptor systems, based on simple bridged azabiaryls  and their
              transition metal complexes, can be employed to  accomplish useful chemistry.
              Pyridazine based bridging ligands  offer the opportunity to complex two metals
              such that substrate  molecules in the coordination sphere of the metal can
              interact  with one another and provide structural access to the  photoredox
              catalyzed generation of oxygen from water. Simple  and very accessible host
              molecules, which have been shown to be  excellent urea binders, will be used to
              immobilize carbonic and  carbamic acids to render them useful as synthetic 
              intermediates. Carefully tailored hosts will be prepared as a  urease mimic to
              catalyze the hydrolysis of urea and for the  formation of ureaphanes. Finally,
              the ferrocene nucleus will be  employed as a "variable hinge" in which the
              relative  orientation of substituents on the two cyclopentadienyl rings  can be
              controlled.  %%%  With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting 
              the research of Dr. Randolph P. Thummel of the Department of  Chemistry at the
              University of Houston. Professor Thummel will  focus his work on demonstrating
              that carefully designed  receptor systems can be employed to accomplish useful 
              chemistry. Azabiaryl ligands and their transition metal  complexes will be used
              to catalyze the photoredox generation of  oxygen from water, to immobilize
              carbonic and carbamic acids to  render them useful as synthetic intermediates,
              and to be a  urease mimic to hydrolyze urea.  ***
