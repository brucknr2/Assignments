Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  It has been assumed for a long time that feeding strategies               
              influence behavior, and that behavioral variations may lead to the             
              divergence of species.  This study of two closely related primate              
              groups that live in the same area and have somewhat different                  
              diets, will provide a direct test of how food preferences (fruit               
              eaters vs. leaf eaters) may influence the adoption of distinct                 
              activity patterns and species-specific behaviors, including                    
              different territorial behaviors.  The groups are two species of                
              Indriids occupying nearly indentical ranges in eastern Madagascar.
