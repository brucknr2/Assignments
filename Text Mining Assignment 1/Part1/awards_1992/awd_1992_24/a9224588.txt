Abstract    :
              Large scale disasters challenge the orderly functioning of the                 
              social system and control of deviance in a social system.                      
              Hurricane Andrew presents an immediate situation in which to                   
              examine the breakdown, maintenance, or re-organization of social               
              control.  This project will explore the impact of the hurriance on             
              law and informal social control in the Miami area.  Observations               
              and interviews with law enforcement officials and residents will               
              be conducted in areas of major impact from the hurricane.  The                 
              selected sites will provide variations in class and ethnicity of               
              the affected populations and degree of destruction in the affected             
              areas.  Supplemental interviews will be conducted with University              
              of Florida students whose homes are in the hurricane-affected                  
              areas.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              The research is guided by Black's theory of the behavior of law                
              and routine activities theory of crime.  The aim is to explore the             
              interaction for formal and informal control and the extent to which            
              social control breaks down or is maintained under disaster                     
              conditions.  Not only will many questions of theoretical                       
              significance to understanding social control be explored but the               
              research has immediate practical implications for policy and                   
              planning in the wake of such disasters.
