Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Recent studies in steam ecology have indicated that                            
              stream sediments support a biologically active                                 
              community.  This community is connected to the surface                         
              stream by vertical currents that transport substances                          
              such as nutrients and organic matter between these two                         
              areas.  Even when the stream appears "dried up", flow                          
              may continue beneath the sediment surface; thus,                               
              biological activity can continue in this "hyporheic                            
              zone" during drought.  While it is know that the                               
              hyporheic zone is biologically active; the source of                           
              energy supporting these activities is unknown.  The                            
              goal of this research is to determine how the hyporheic                        
              zone is "fueled" on a seasonal basis and between flood-                        
              disturbance events.                                                            
                                                                                             
              A combination of field measurements and experiments                            
              will be conducted to test several hypotheses explaining                        
              the economy of this ecological system.  Chief among                            
              these are that organic matter is derived from surface                          
              photosynthesis and transported either as dissolved or                          
              particulate material deep into the hyporheic zone.  An                         
              alternative is that organisms of this depend on                                
              material derived from the terrestrial watershed (e.g.                          
              leaves, twigs, decomposed wood) and transported to the                         
              stream channel during flash floods.  A better                                  
              understanding of the hyporheic zone as part of the                             
              larger stream ecosystem will aid in managing this                              
              resource wisely and in extending environmental                                 
              protection to all functional components of the                                 
              ecosystem, including subsurface and groundwater                                
              elements.
