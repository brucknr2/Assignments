Abstract    :
                   In order to broaden the agenda for scientific research in                 
              machine translation, it is proposed to conduct a workshop that will            
              bring together investigators currently at the forefront of this                
              field along with key scientists in related areas of natural                    
              language processing.  The program has been designed to bring out               
              the link between evaluation and future directions in MT research.              
              Evaluation is seen not as a results-oriented activity but rather as            
              an intellectual exercise that focuses attention on areas in which              
              research is needed.  The program includes the evaluation of related            
              NLP research .  In addition, three entire sessions will be devoted             
              specifically to addressing the issues that MT science is currently             
              facing:  "Contributions of Related NLP Research to Future                      
              Directions in MT," and "Future Directions in MT."  Each of these               
              sessions will be a discussion based on a series of specific topics             
              prepared in advance by a study team to be designated for this                  
              purpose, which will guide the debate.  A summary report will be                
              prepared for general dissemination.                                            
                   This activity comes at an important time in the development of            
              MT science.  Fresh insights are needed, especially from areas of               
              NLP that incorporate the latest linguistic research in discourse               
              theory.  The evaluation process,  a spontaneous movement that is               
              gaining momentum in the MT field throughout the world, helps to                
              bring to light the research issues that hold the key to process.
