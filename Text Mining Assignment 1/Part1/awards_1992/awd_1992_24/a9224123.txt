Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Continued funding is being provided to partially support specific              
              activities of the International Association of the Physical                    
              Sciences of the Ocean (IAPSO) Secretariat.  IAPSO is one of seven              
              Associations of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics              
              (IUGG) which in turn is constituted within the International                   
              Commission of Scientific Unions (ICSU).  The United States is a                
              Member of these Unions and the NSF is a Representative agency.                 
                                                                                             
              The Office of the Secretary General performs the day-to-day                    
              functions of IAPSO, involving communications within and external to            
              IAPSO, the execution of policies and directives, and it has fiscal             
              responsibilities for the Association's operation.  Much of the                 
              Secretariat's work involves preparation for, conduct of, and                   
              reporting on assemblies, meetings, symposia, and workshops.                    
                                                                                             
              Since its founding in 1919, the primary goal of IAPSO has been to              
              "...promote the study of scientific problems relating to the oceans            
              and the interactions taking place at the sea floor, coastal, and               
              atmospheric boundaries insofar as such research is conducted by the            
              use of mathematics, physics, and chemistry."    IAPSO activities               
              are scientifically relevant and seek to encourage participation of             
              young scientists and scientists from developing countries by                   
              providing opportunities to develop working relationships with                  
              established U.S. oceanographers.  Partial support is also being                
              provided by Office of Naval Research and NOAA.
