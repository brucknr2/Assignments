Abstract    :
              In this continuing study in the Theoretical and Computational                  
              Chemistry program of the Division of Chemistry the properties                  
              of bulk metals, metallic surfaces, and catalytic materials are                 
              being studied with the aid of the corrected effective medium                   
              (CEM) theory of metallic bonding.  Computer programs for the                   
              implementation of the theory are being upgraded so that                        
              increasingly larger systems can be studied.  Specific areas of                 
              investigation include studies of hopping vs replacement                        
              mechanisms of diffusion, of the thermodynamic stability of thin                
              films and surface alloys, and of the kinetic processes in                      
              metallic film growth.                                                          
              %%%                                                                            
              The surfaces of metals play a particularly important role in                   
              many physical and chemical processes including crystal growth                  
              and catalysis.  Modern computational methods based on quantum                  
              mechanical models of the electronic structure of metals are                    
              being used in this project to obtain a better understanding of                 
              these processes.
