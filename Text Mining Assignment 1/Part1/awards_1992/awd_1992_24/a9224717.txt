Abstract    :
              9224717  Weber  This is an award the objective of which is to  understand the
              mechanisms for methylation of  inorganic tin and dimethylation of methyltin 
              compounds in estuarine salt marshes.  This  knowledge has potential
              applicability  in determination of the potential hazards that  aquatic
              sediments contained with these  compounds pose to aquatic organisms and to 
              their ecosystem.  Specifically, the research  addresses the seasonal variations
              of inorganic  tin and methyltin compounds in marsh grass,  the methylation of
              these tin compounds in  marsh sediments, in sediment slurries and in  mixed and
              pure cultures of microorganisms  isolated from the estuarine marsh habitat.   
              Methyl and butyltin compounds are ubiquitous  in marine coastal environments,
              thought  generally to have originated from use of tin  compounds as ingredients
              of marine antifouling  paints.  These compounds wear off or flake  from the
              surfaces to which they are applied  and become associated with benthic
              deposits.   Methylated tin compounds are considerably  more toxic to life-forms
              than tin itself, and  are more mobile and easily bioaccumulated.   Results of
              this research are expected to  provide insights into appropriate management  of
              contaminated aquatic sediments to reduce  their potential biocidal effects on
              the  ecosystem into which they are introduced or to  which they may be
              transported.
