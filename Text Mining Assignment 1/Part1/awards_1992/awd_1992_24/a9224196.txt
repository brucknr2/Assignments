Abstract    :
                   This award covers experimental Elementary Particle                        
              Physics Research by a group at Rutgers University in                           
              collaboration with other NSF and DOE supported scientists.                     
              The group will continue studying polarized e+e- interactions                   
              at the Stanford Linear Collider (SLC).  They will also finish                  
              the analysis of neutrino-neon interaction data taken at                        
              Fermilab, study the design of detectors for the proposed Tau-                  
              Charm factory in Seville, Spain, and also study the use of                     
              diamond films for use in high energy particle calorimetry at                   
              the Superconducting Super Collider (SSC).
