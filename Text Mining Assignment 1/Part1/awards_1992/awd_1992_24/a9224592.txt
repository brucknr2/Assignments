Abstract    :
                   This grant will support the publication of the                            
              proceedings of the 1993 Particle Accelerator Conference, the                   
              fifteenth in the series.  These conferences have become the                    
              most important record of developments in the emerging cross-                   
              disciplinary science of particle accelerators.
