Abstract    :
              This SGER award will support the parallel implementation of the                
              immersed boundary method in the application of a three-                        
              dimensional heart model.  The immersed boundary method is a                    
              computational technique for the simulation of systems in which a               
              viscous incompressible fluid interacts with an immersed elastic                
              boundary  Such systems are ubiquitous in biological fluid                      
              dynamics, and the immersed boundary method has already been                    
              applied to problems of blood flow in the cardiac chambers,                     
              platelet aggregation during blood clotting, aquatic animal                     
              locomotion, and wave propagation in the inner ear.  Current                    
              implementation of the immersed boundary method are fully                       
              vectorized on Cray computers, but only a single processor is used              
              although several are available.  The aim of  the proposed                      
              research is to create a parallel implementation which maintains                
              full vectorization while making effective use of all available                 
              processors.  This work will be done on the Cray C-90 Computer, a               
              16-processor machine which is scheduled to arrive at the                       
              Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center this fall.  The scientific                    
              utility of the immerse boundary method will be enormously                      
              enhanced by the anticipated speedup resulting from                             
              parallelization.
