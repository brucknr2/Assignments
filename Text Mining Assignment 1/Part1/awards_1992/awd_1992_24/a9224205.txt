Abstract    :
                   This grant supports the research of Dr. Hendrik Lenstra as a              
              principal investigator.  Dr. Lenstra will continue his                         
              investigations on developing algorithms in the area of algebraic               
              number theory.  This research will also impact on the fields of                
              elliptic curves and abelian varieties, finite fields and group                 
              theory                                                                         
                   This is research in the field of number theory.   Number                  
              theory starts with the whole numbers and questions such as the                 
              divisibility of one whole number by another.  It is among the                  
              oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for                 
              purely aesthetic reasons.  However, within the last half century,              
              it has become an essential tool in developing new algorithms for               
              computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics.
