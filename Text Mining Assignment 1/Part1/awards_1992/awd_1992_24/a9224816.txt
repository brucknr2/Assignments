Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This proposal will support undergraduate students to pursue               
              research during a convective field project in the summer of 1993 in            
              the Bismarck/North Dakota area.  A field program called the North              
              Dakota Tracer Experiment is planned for the period 21 June - 30                
              July 1993.  The focus of the project is the study of the transport,            
              dispersion, ice nucleation, and precipitation growth processes in              
              actively growing convective clouds.  The primary scientific goal is            
              to increase understanding about ice initiation in natural and                  
              seeded clouds, and its relation to the subsequent development of               
              precipitation (including hail).
