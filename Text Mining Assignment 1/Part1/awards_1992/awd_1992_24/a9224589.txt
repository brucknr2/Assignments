Abstract    :
                   The novel concept offered in this proposal was to introduce               
              metal colloids/precipitates in the ceramics, and to enhance the                
              toughness and ductility properties of the ceramics.  Precipitate               
              sizes and their number density are to be optimized in the synthesis            
              and processing part of this proposed work.  Detailed material                  
              characterization and modeling of toughness and ductility are to be             
              used to correlate microstructures with the mechanical properties of            
              the ceramics.  This proposal intends to investigate the cases of               
              metal colloids/precipitates in MgO or Al2O3 ceramics.  Metals can              
              be transition metals such as Ni.

              This project investigates metal colloids/precipitates in MgO or                
              Al2O3 ceramics.  It offers the metal colloids/precipitates as                  
              infinite sources of dislocations, which contribute to the                      
              improvements in toughness as well as to ductility.  If provides                
              great potentials in expanding the possible applications of ceramics            
              as structural elements.  Potential benefits to the industrial usage            
              of ceramics can be very substantial.
