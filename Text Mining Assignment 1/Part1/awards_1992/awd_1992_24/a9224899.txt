Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the synthesis and study of                       
              thioquinones, selena and telluro anhydrides, chalcogenofulvenes                
              and chalcogenofulvalenes, and nonclassical thiophenes. The                     
              results in the fulvene-fulvalene areas are expected to lead to                 
              one-dimensional conductors and perhaps to new superconductors.                 
              Charge transfer complexes with unusual solid state properties                  
              will also be sought as will new routes to organotellurium                      
              compounds. It is possible that the research will lead to the                   
              production of new conducting polymers and near infrared dyes.

              With this renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is                      
              supporting the research of Drs. Michael P. Cava and M.V.                       
              Lakshmikantham of the Department of Chemistry at the University                
              of Alabama.  The research is focused on the bonding, stability                 
              and utility of the C=X (X=S,Se,Te) bond. Results in this area                  
              will lead to a better understanding of the properties of such                  
              compopunds and subsequent application to the design of organic                 
              materials including synthetic metals and those possessing                      
              nonlinear optical properties.
