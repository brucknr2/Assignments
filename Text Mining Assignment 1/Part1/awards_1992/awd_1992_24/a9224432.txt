Abstract    :
              In this project, Prof. P. Houston of Cornell University will                   
              continue a series of investigations on the photodissociation                   
              dynamics of free radicals and state-selected molecules in the                  
              gaseous state.  Previous work on the HCO system has shown the                  
              possibility of investigating the photodissociation process with                
              a high degree of product state specificity and the work to be                  
              performed in this project is based on this success to extend                   
              these studies to other systems.  Specifically, the                             
              photodissociation of the radicals HCO, NCO, methylene, methoxy,                
              and others, will be investigated.  These small radicals are                    
              particularly suitable for study since they are also amenable to                
              theoretical treatment.  Examples of investigations in the                      
              photodissociation dynamics of state-selected molecules are                     
              ozone, glyoxal, and other molecules, using the directly                        
              observable influence of the initial state excitation on the                    
              product distribution.%%%                                                       
              This research probes the fundamental chemistry of the                          
              photodissociation phenomenon by investigating  a carefully                     
              chosen set of free radicals and molecules.  The increased                      
              understanding of photodissociation dynamics which will come                    
              from these studies will have bearing on our knowledge of                       
              combustion processes and atmospheric chemistry.***
