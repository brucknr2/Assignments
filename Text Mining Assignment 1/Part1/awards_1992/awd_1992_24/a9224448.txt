Abstract    :
              9224448  Rosswall    NSF support is provided from funds allocated for the
              planning,  development and implementation of regional institutes for global 
              change research.  The International START Secretariat will  undertake a series
              of scientific planning activities related to  development of regional
              networks/institutes for global change  research in Africa. START (the
              IGBP/WCRP/HDP System for Research,  Analysis, and Training) will initiate
              scientific workshops and  planning meetings, participation of scientists from
              the region in  these and related activities, such as training courses for
              global  change research.  This effort will focus on sub-regional research 
              networks for North Africa; Southern, Central Africa; and the  Mediterranean
              region.  This effort will also consider linkages  among these sub-regional
              networks and between them and other  similar regional activities in Europe, the
              Americas, and Asia.
