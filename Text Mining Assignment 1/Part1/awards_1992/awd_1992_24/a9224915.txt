Abstract    :
              Seasonal and interannual variabilities of the tropical ocean-                  
              atmosphere system are affected by a variety of processes which at              
              present are not well understood.  This research includes process               
              studies on such subject areas as:  1)the organization of convection            
              over tropical oceans, 2)the contributions of convectively driven               
              and boundary layer circulations to interannual surface wind                    
              anomalies, 3) the structure of the climatological convergence zones            
              and trade wind systems, 4) the dynamics of tropical air-sea                    
              interaction in the context of the global tropics, and 5) the                   
              influence of multi-mode ocean dynamics on ENSO structure and                   
              variability.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              Among the most effective tools for these process studies are                   
              numerical models that are more general and more complete than the              
              typical intermediate models developed and used at Columbia                     
              University/Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory and yet are                   
              simpler, more easily interpreted, and more efficient than the                  
              typical Global Circulation Models (GCMs).  A generalized ocean                 
              model for use in item 5 above has already been developed and a                 
              global, spherical, multi-layer atmosphere model is nearly ready for            
              application in items 1 and 2 above.  This atmosphere model has been            
              developed under previous National Science Foundation support.                  
                                                                                             
              The methods of analysis draw heavily on inverse calculations, where            
              atmospheric states derived from operational analyses or GCM                    
              simulations will be used to infer the forcing fields appropriate to            
              realistic simulations, thereby assisting in the development of                 
              parameterizations necessary for the above process studies.
