Abstract    :
              Fiber Optic Tapers are used in many applications including:                    
              Intensified Low Light Level Cameras, Night Vision Systems,                     
              UV/IR Spectroscopy and Medical, Industrial and Scientific X-                   
              Ray Imaging systems.  In these applications, the taper is                      
              coupled to a CCD imager in order to increase the area that                     
              can be imaged.  With rare exceptions, the tapers are under                     
              85mm diameter, the majority being 50mm diameter or less.                       
                                                                                             
              There is, however, a need for tapers in the 150mm to 200mm                     
              range, in Medical and Scientific application, where larger                     
              and higher resolution images are required.  Progress,                          
              however, has been restricted due to the relatively small                       
              size of CCD's and non-availability of large tapers.  To                        
              overcome this, smaller tapers have been built into arrays                      
              and coupled to multiple CCD's.  this is a costly and                           
              inefficient arrangement.                                                       
                                                                                             
              Prior to Phase I, limitations of existing taper technology                     
              had restricted the size attempted to 115mm.  Only a few of                     
              these costly units had been made, many manufacturing                           
              problems remaining unsolved, especially optical distortion                     
              and thermal damage to the glass.                                               
                                                                                             
              New technology developed at INCOM was applied to these                         
              problems during Phase I demonstrating that many existing                       
              limitations can be overcome.  Given additional research, the                   
              development of a completely new manufacturing process                          
              enabling the fabrication of Large Tapers is possible.  Thus,                   
              we propose to continue to advance the state of the art by                      
              conducting additional research on the more complex and                         
              larger tapers required for the advancement of this element                     
              of Electro-Optical Imaging Technology.
