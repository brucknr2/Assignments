Abstract    :
                9224741  Livny    This is the first year funding of a three-year continuing
              award.   Over the last decade, a dramatic increase has been observed in the 
              ability of individual experimental scientists to generate and store  data. 
              This increase has not been matched by an equivalent  development of adequate
              data management tools.  The goal of this  project is to develop an Experiment
              Management System (EMS) that  meets the needs of experimental scientists from a
              wide range of  disciplines.  Located on the scientist's desk, the EMS serves as
               the sole interface between the scientist and the data.  Throughout  the life
              cycle of an experimental study, the EMS can be used to  design the study, order
              experiments, manage the generated data, and  analyze the results.  Graphical
              user interfaces and integration of  database systems with experimentation
              environments are the  fundamental database research challenges addressed by
              this project.   While the EMS under development is generic in many aspects, 
              specific emphasis is given to the special requirements of a plant  growth
              simulation environment, an Integrated Microscopy Resource,  and a simulation
              laboratory.  Once placed on the desk of scientists  who use these experimental
              environments, the new data management  technology encapsulated in the EMS will
              improve scientists  productivity and establish a new paradigm in managing
              experimental  studies.  ***
