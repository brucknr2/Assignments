Abstract    :
                   This award supports paleoclimate reserch in Iceland within the            
              framework of PALE (Paleoclimates of Arctic Lakes and Estuaries).               
              Iceland occupies a key position in the North Atlantic in terms of              
              both climatic and oceanographic parameters.  The climate of the                
              island is a function of the strength and location of the Icelandic             
              Low, the strength and character of the freshwater outflow from the             
              Arctic Basin, and the location of the North Atlantic Drift.  These             
              variables interact to affect the vegetation, hydrology, and glacial            
              history of this area; Iceland thus well placed for developing                  
              longer proxy records of climate change.
