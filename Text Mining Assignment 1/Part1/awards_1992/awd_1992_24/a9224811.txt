Abstract    :
                   The research involves the study of the geometry of                        
              quaternionic orbifolds and Einstein metrics of positive scalar                 
              curvature.  The latter includes the construction of metrics on                 
              torus bundles over Kaehler-Einstein orbifolds.  These have                     
              applications to recent advances in supergravity and the non-                   
              linear sigma model in particle physics.
