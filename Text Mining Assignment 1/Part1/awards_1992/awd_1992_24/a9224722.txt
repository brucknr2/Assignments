Abstract    :
              9224722  Panagiotopoulos  This award supports Professor Athanassios
              Panagiotopoulos of Cornell  University to collaborate in chemical engineering
              research with  Professor Daan Frenkel of the FOM Institute for Atomic and
              Molecular  Physics in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.  Both of their research 
              groups have been very active in the field of molecular simulation of  phase
              equilibria and free energy calculations.  The primary research  objective of
              their collaboration is the development of methods for  the calculation of phase
              equilibria for long-chain polymeric  systems, and the application of these new
              methods to simple physical  models of multisegment molecules.  They will use
              the results of  their calculations for systematic comparisons with statistical 
              mechanical theories of polymer thermodynamics.  They will also  attempt some
              direct comparisons with experimental data where  appropriate.  The proposed
              research will utilize the complementary  skills of the two research groups in
              simulations and algorithm  development.    The determination of the chemical
              potentials and phase behavior of  macromolecular systems from molecular
              simulation is a long-standing  problem in statistical mechanics with
              significant potential  theoretical and practical implications.  The
              collaboration of the  Cornell and FOM groups is likely to contribute
              substantially to  finding a solution, due to a combination of the powerful new 
              techniques they have recently developed.  ***
