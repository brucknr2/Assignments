Abstract    :
              The research entails investigations into the study of the moduli  space of
              Yang-Mills fields on 4-manifolds using techniques of  topology and the
              geometric theory of partial differential  equations.  This research should lead
              to a deeper understanding  of the quantum theoretic background to minimization
              of action  functionals.  As such, there are potential applications to  quantum
              theory and space-time physics.
