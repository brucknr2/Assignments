Abstract    :
                9224783  Hardwick    This is the first year funding of a three-year continuing
              award.   This project is designing and building a prototype archive and 
              version control system that facilitates concurrent engineering by  allowing
              engineers to coordinate concurrent changes to a design.   The system permits
              engineers to merge concurrent changes, find  conflicts between concurrent
              changes, ask questions about the  contents of changes and designs, and resolve
              conflicts between  design versions produced by concurrent changes.  The system
              models  the contents of a design using the EXPRESS language of the STEP 
              standard for the exchange of engineering product data.  The EXPRESS  schemas
              are managed by the archive and version control system in  addition to the
              design versions themselves so that the various  tools of the system have access
              to both the data and its schemas.   The system will significantly advance the
              data management  infrastructure for concurrent engineering and manufacturing by
               supporting collaborations between engineers as they concurrently  work on the
              design of products.   ***
