Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Males of a number of species produce more than one type                        
              of sperm, some types contain and some lack DNA.  Males                         
              of Drosophila obscura produce sperm of various discrete                        
              lengths, a phenomenon known as polymegaly.  While all                          
              types contain DNA, the potential biological benefit of                         
              producing different lengths is unknown.  In fact, the                          
              evolutionary significance of this polymorphism is not                          
              understood in any species.  The present study tests the                        
              biological and evolutionary significance of polymegaly                         
              in some members of the Drosophila obscura group.                               
                                                                                             
              In addition to a better understanding of basic                                 
              reproductive biology and evolutionary theory, this                             
              research may assist in the development of biological                           
              control programs.  One current methodology for                                 
              "natural" insect pest control is to release many                               
              sterile males in the hopes that females will mate with                         
              these males rather than fertile males currently in the                         
              population.  Since a number of insect species exhibit                          
              sperm polymorphism, this research may provide                                  
              information useful in pest management programs.
