Abstract    :
              The purpose of this "high-risk, High-payoff" research is to                    
              develop a new approach to fracture mechanics, called "Quantum                  
              Fracture Mechanics" by the PI.  This will be accomplished using                
              quantum fracture mechanics to focus in on a single typical                     
              problem and analyzing it in detail.  The goal is to predict basic              
              mechanical properties of a material (including the nonlinear                   
              stress-strain diagram, fracture toughness, the R-curve, and                    
              others) in terms of fundamental constants associated with the                  
              atomic structure of the material, rather than from macro-scale                 
              experiments, as is traditionally done.  Such a methodology would               
              be of enormous scientific and practical value.  It would allow                 
              numerical simulations to be performed that could be used to                    
              predict the mechanical properties of new materials prior to their              
              physical realization.  Such a tool would allow for the economic                
              and rapid design and attainment of new materials for high                      
              performance applications.
