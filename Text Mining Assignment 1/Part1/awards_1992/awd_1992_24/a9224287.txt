Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Graduate student Warren Hauk, under the supervision of                         
              adviser Clifford Parks at the University of North                              
              Carolina, is developing molecular datasets to address                          
              fundamental phylogenetic problems surrounding the                              
              Ophioglossaceae, which is generally regarded as the                            
              most primitive of extant fern families.  DNA sequencing                        
              of both a plastid and nuclear gene will be used to                             
              evaluate existing morphological analyses.  Preliminary                         
              analyses demonstrated amounts of sequence divergence                           
              appropriate to address relationships not only among                            
              families and genera but also to the level of cryptis                           
              species, which many species in Botrychium subgenus                             
              Botrychium have been designated.  Comparisons of                               
              plastid and nuclear genes will permit evaluation of the                        
              hybrid origin of putative allopolyploid species.                               
              Morphological and anatomical characters used in                                
              previous phylogenetic studies will be reanalyzed and                           
              compared to (and possibly combined with molecular                              
              trees.
