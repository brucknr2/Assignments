Abstract    :
                9224660  Ozsoyoglu    SDB:  Scientific Database Research for Polymers and
              Materials  Engineering Needs    This is the first year funding of a four-year
              continuing award.    This research project develops a system for managing data
              generated  by fracture study experiments in Polymers and Materials 
              Engineering.  The experiment data produced by materials engineers  is large and
              has several data types that include summary data,  image data, spatial data,
              and temporal data obtained by applying  differing amounts of multiaxial
              stresses to materials at different  times.  The types of queries on the
              experiment data include  statistical queries, matching queries, mapping
              queries, and  temporal queries.  The project involves integrating technologies 
              from spatial and object-oriented databases, computational geometry,  and image
              processing.  New data structures, data models, query  languages and query
              processing techniques that enable efficient  storage and retrieval of data are
              designed.  And a prototype  scientific database management system is developed
              and tested.   Such an integrated data management environment will benefit the 
              researchers in polymers and materials engineering disciplines.   Furthermore,
              the essential principles abstracted in this project  can be used for data
              management in other disciplines.   ***
