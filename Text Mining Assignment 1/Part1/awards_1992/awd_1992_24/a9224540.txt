Abstract    :
                   The major objective of this research is to develop models for             
              the performance evaluation of manufacturing and communications                 
              networks.  The focus will be on modeling "intelligent" networks                
              with dependent nodes, congestion-dependent routing, and concurrent             
              movements of units.  Such networks typically have routing of units             
              to avoid congestion, routing constraints due to physical capacities            
              or workload balancing, dynamically increasing or decreasing the                
              processing rate at a node whenever downstream nodes are starved                
              congested, parallel processing among several nodes, splitting and              
              merging of units, concurrent movement or batch processing of units,            
              and sharing of resources (tools, computer files) to do processing.             
                   The researchers intend to develop a large class of "partially             
              balanced" network processes that incorporate the dependencies,                 
              which cannot be handled by the existing theory of Jackson and                  
              quasi-reversible processes, as they deal only with independent                 
              nodes and routings.  The work involves characterizing the                      
              equilibrium behavior of partially balanced network processes and               
              developing subclasses of these processes with specific network                 
              topologies, node dependencies and flow controls that arise in                  
              manufacturing and communications.
