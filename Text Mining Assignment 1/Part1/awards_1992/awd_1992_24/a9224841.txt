Abstract    :
              9224841  Yarger       The equipment requested in this proposal will enable
              students  in the large-lecture survey course to move from spectators to  active
              participants in using UNIDATA projects to "explore" and  "evaluate" atmospheric
              behaviors.  Many of the students in this  course are education majors, so
              hands-on computer experience will  help reduce computer phobia and demonstrate
              the intimate  relationship between science, computers and their use in K-12 
              education.  This grant will help to obtain 10 workstations for an  interactive
              weather laboratory to support this course  ***
