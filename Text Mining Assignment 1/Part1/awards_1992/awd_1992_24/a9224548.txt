Abstract    :
              The Problem of self consistent  plasma wave-particle interaction               
              is studied using the CHIP-1 facility.  The objective is to                     
              explore these interactions under chaotic conditions in order to                
              provide a meaningful set of data useful to plasma theorists                    
              studying chaotic motion.  The research has application to space                
              physics and particle accelerators and has significance in many                 
              other areas of physics trying to understand and predict chaotic                
              dynamics.
