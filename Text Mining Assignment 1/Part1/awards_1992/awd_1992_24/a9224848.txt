Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research will be devoted to a study of powerful                           
              extragalactic radio sources.  These sources are associated                     
              with the nuclei of quasars and active galaxies, where                          
              enormous amounts of energy are generated on very short                         
              timescales, probably due to the infall of material onto a                      
              supermassive black hole.  At radio wavelengths we see very                     
              compact (a few light-years) 'cores' and 'jet-like' features,                   
              that vary rapidly in total intensity and polarization.  In                     
              many sources, bright 'knots' of emission appear to move down                   
              the jets at several times the speed of light.  The main part                   
              of the research will involve imaging the polarized radiation                   
              from these radio sources at milliarcsecond resolution. The                     
              underlying goal is to elucidate the relationships between                      
              different classes of radio sources and to understand the                       
              physical processes occurring in the vicinity of massive                        
              black holes.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              The Principal Investigator is regarded as an outstanding                       
              theoretical astrophysicist.
