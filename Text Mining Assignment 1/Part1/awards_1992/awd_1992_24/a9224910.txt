Abstract    :
              9224910  Sakaluk  This award supports Professor Scott Sakaluk of Illinois State 
              University to collaborate in behavioral ecology research with  Professor Josef
              K. Mueller of the Institute of Zoology, Albert  Ludwigs University, Freiburg,
              Germany.  The objective of their  research is to test various hypotheses about
              the reproductive  strategies and parental behavior of male "burying beetles" 
              (Nicrophorus vespilloides).  They will carry out field experiments 
              manipulating various factors that influence reproductive behavior in  order to
              test the effect of male assistance on brood success.    Paternal care is rare
              in insects, and the factors favoring its  evolution remain unclear.  Burying
              beetles are one of only a few  arthropod taxa exhibiting biparental care, in
              which both parents  obtain food for the developing young.  There are several
              hypotheses  to explain the continued presence of the male; however, field 
              studies to examine the effects of the male's presence on the number  of
              surviving young have not been done.  This research will test two  competing
              hypotheses (paternal care and mating effort) and attempt  to improve
              understanding of this area of insect behavior.  ***
