Abstract    :
                      Energy consumption usually increases at a faster rate than             
              does economic output in developing nations, because almost all                 
              major changes associated with economic development                             
              (industrialization, increases in the capital-to-labor ratio,                   
              substitution of commercial energy for traditional energy, the                  
              construction of modern infrastructure, mechanization, and                      
              urbanization) require more intensive use of energy.  Economic                  
              development in China in the 1980s did not follow this pattern,                 
              however, as energy intensity actually declined by almost 30                    
              percent from 1980 to 1988.  This project will explore this                     
              decline in China's energy intensity and will identify those                    
              factors that were responsible for the reduction.  Energy will be               
              examined as an intermediate input in the production of goods and               
              services, and changes in energy intensity will be examined within              
              the framework of both final demands and production technologies                
              and functions.  Structural-decomposition analytic techniques will              
              be used to analyze data from a range of different sources that                 
              document Chinese economic activity over the study period, thereby              
              forming the basis for merging quantitative modelling approaches                
              at macro and micro levels with qualitative assessments based on                
              case studies, site visits, and personal interviews.                            
                      This project will enhance understandings about this                    
              important topic in a number of ways.  The database used for many               
              of the analyses will bring together relevant information from a                
              diverse range of sources, thereby facilitating research by                     
              others.  Knowledge of the relationships between economic                       
              development and energy use in China will be improved, but these                
              insights also will provide new perspectives for other nations.                 
              Of special utility will be new knowledge of ways that national                 
              and regional policymakers might be able to foster energy                       
              conservation while simultaneously spurring economic development.
