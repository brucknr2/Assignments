Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Increasing atmospheric CO2 may have profound effects on                        
              ecosystem carbon dynamics that could feed back to                              
              mitigate or exacerbate climate change.  Through some                           
              studies have examined the effects of elevated CO2 on                           
              whole system carbon balance, few, if any, have examined                        
              its effects on soil respiration and soil carbon                                
              storage; these ecosystem processes will likely control                         
              whole-system feedbacks to climate change.  Furthermore,                        
              it is important to understand how elevated CO2 affects                         
              the oxidation of different pools of soil carbon                                
              (relatively recent photosynthate, litter, and old soil                         
              organic matter), because if these pools respond                                
              differently, whole-system carbon storage and carbon                            
              allocation could be dramatically altered.                                      
                                                                                             
              In this proposal, the student request funding to                               
              examine the effects of elevated CO2 on the importance                          
              of rhizodeposits (carbon deposited belowground by plant                        
              roots), a single plant litter cohort, and remaining                            
              soil organic matter, in contributing to soil                                   
              respiration in an annual grassland ecosystem.  He will                         
              also investigate the effect of elevated CO2 on carbon                          
              storage in soil organic matter pools with longer                               
              turnover times.  The proposed research offers a novel                          
              method of partitioning soil respiration into                                   
              contributions of roots and microorganisms using a                              
              stable carbon isotope tracer, will contribute to a                             
              mechanistic understanding of the effects of elevated                           
              CO2 on soil carbon cycling, and will help refine his                           
              predictions of biological feedbacks to global climate                          
              change.
