Abstract    :
                   This project will bring seven undergraduate students to the               
              University of California, Berkeley for an eight week period in each            
              of the summers of 1993, 1994, and 1995.  The research projects will            
              focus on microelectronics, communications, and computer science.               
              The participants will have completed their junior year, and will               
              all be women, or members of an underrepresented ethnic minority.               
              In addition to working one on one with a faculty member in the                 
              Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, each                
              participant will be assigned to a graduate student co-mentor of the            
              same gender or ethnicity.
