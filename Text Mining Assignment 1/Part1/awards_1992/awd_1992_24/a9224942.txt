Abstract    :
                  This is an SBIR Phase II award directed to the use of unobtrusive
              autostereoscopic techniques for the display of three-dimensional views.  The
              advantages of three-dimensional viewing are widely recognized but the
              restrictive use of glasses and the lace of understanding of image acquisition
              and configuration for its 3-D use have thwarted widespread acceptance in
              practical applications.  The teleoperation applications to be considered
              include teleroboticic mining, underwater search and salvage, and medical
              endoscopic microsurgery.  The research concentrates on solving the problems of
              balanced picture acquisition and processing, and unobtrusive viewing systems
              for autostereoscopy and consider mechanical, electronic, and optical
              constraints such as camera mounting, required signal bandwidth, and field of
              view and wide-angle viewing.  These results translate in better choices for
              viewer movement range, camera configuration, and resolution.
