Abstract    :
              An active image information system for biomedical image databases is developed
              based upon the concept of smart images.  A smart image is an image with an
              associated knowledge structure, consisting of protocols, hot spots, active
              indexes and attributes. This active image information system supports the
              objectives of timely delivery and easy accessibility of biomedical image data.
              The experimental prototype of the smart image system is developed by
              researchers at the Department of Computer Science and tested at the Cardiology
              Division of the University of Pittsburgh.  The decision protocols are
              implemented using the smart image system, so that a physician or a cardiologist
              can retrieve and display images from different sources, and conduct the normal
              diagnostic procedures.  The automation of this medical image information
              gathering and archiving process greatly benefits the cardiologists to relieve
              them from the tedious repeated work and to enable them to concentrate on
              patient treatment.  The active image information system and medical image
              databases will also provide a testbed for advanced research in image databases,
              with potential applications to process control, power plant outage management
              and other areas.
