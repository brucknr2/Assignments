Abstract    :
              9224817  HARRISS       Attention on the human dimensions of global change in 
              developing countries has tended to focus on changing rural land-  use patterns,
              but profound changes in human activities that  impact on natural environmental
              conditions also have occurred in  urban places.  Changes in energy use in
              rapidly growing cities of  Asia may have especially strong impacts on future
              emissions of  greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.  This doctoral dissertation
               research project will assess the ways that human activities alter  chemical
              and energy flows to and from the landscape and  atmosphere in Cebu City, a
              rapidly growing industrial center in  the southern Philippines.  A household
              energy-use study will be  conducted in about 600 households, with particular
              attention  focusing on transitions from use of biomass to fossil fuels.  The 
              data from these surveys will be analyzed in concert with data on  commercial
              fossil fuel use in order to better assess the socio-  economic factors that
              influence fuels used for different kinds of  activities.  These analyses will
              contribute toward development of  integrated energy and trace-gas emissions
              models for Asian-  Pacific cities.       This project will provide valuable new
              information about a  representative industrial city in the Philippines,
              focusing  special attention on changing patterns of energy use that impact  on
              biological and atmospheric systems.  In addition to providing  a useful case
              study dealing with an important topic, the  add  dissertation end statement.
