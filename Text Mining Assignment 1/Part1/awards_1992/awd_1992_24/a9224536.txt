Abstract    :
              Professor Michael Klein is supported by a grant from the                       
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to continue his                
              research in the application of computer simulations of                         
              classical and quantum phenomena in condensed molecular systems.                
              Constant pressure molecular dynamics will be used to                           
              characterize disordered phases, and to study phase transitions                 
              in molecular systems including fullerenes and sulfate crystals.                
              Path-integral Monte Carlo will be used to characterize and                     
              study quantum phenomena in solids, fluids and clusters, and                    
              quantum simulations using the Car-Parnello approach will be                    
              used to probe the electronic states of metal ammonia solutions                 
              as they pass through the metal-insulator transition region.                    
              %%%                                                                            
              Computer simulation of molecular systems is providing many rich                
              insights into chemical behavior at the molecular level.  As the                
              computer algorithms and force field models continue to improve,                
              it becomes possible to study larger systems, and to gain useful                
              insights regarding more and more physical and chemical                         
              properties.  Using a combination of simulation techniques                      
              including molecular dynamics, quantum Monte Carlo, and                         
              Car-Paranello theory, Klein is able to perform computer                        
              simulations on systems consisting of large numbers of molecules                
              such as crystalline substances, and metal ammonia solutions.                   
              He is able to study a number of important chemical and physical                
              properties of interest in the design of new materials.
