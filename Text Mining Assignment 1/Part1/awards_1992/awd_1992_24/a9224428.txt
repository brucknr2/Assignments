Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This dissertation project investigates the operation of female                 
              choice of mates in a social environment characterized by male                  
              competition.  Recent studies of primate species with harem social              
              organization and large differences in size between sexes assume                
              male-male competition is responsible for social structure, rather              
              than female choice.  However, an association between polygyny and              
              sex dimorphism does not exist in horses, and dominant harem                    
              stallions fail to sire nearly a third of the foals in their bands.             
                                                                                             
              This study at Assateague Island will examine four possible female              
              reproductive strategies for feral horses, and will combine detailed            
              field obserations of behavior and social organization withpaternity            
              assignment.  These data will allow a better understanding of the               
              mating system of horses and particularly the role of female choice             
              in harem social organizations more generally.  The contrast to the             
              usual situation in primates will be very instructive.                          
                                                                                             
              NSF funds are requested for the genetic laboratory phase of the                
              project, otherwise supported by the Hill Foundation.  The project              
              will enhance the training of a young professional.
