Abstract    :
                   Whereas the fact that Genetic Algorithms are massively                    
              parallel positions them to solve difficult problems by effectively             
              exploiting modern computing technology, the future of genetic                  
              search is unclear.  Fundamental question concerning GA response                
              remain unanswered, partially because it is not apparent from a                 
              theoretical vantage point what GAs are.  Recent developments in                
              their formalization via probabilistic techniques are beginning to              
              change this situation.  This project is directed at broadening the             
              coherent group of results which forms the most recent and complete             
              theoretical underpinnings of simple GAs to date.  Specific                     
              objectives include characterizing the emergent behavior of the                 
              simple GA as an evolutionary system, utilizing recent probabilistic            
              formalizations to analyze the behavior of evolutionary trajectories            
              in quantitative terms, and developing predictive relationships and             
              principle governing the direction of genetic search.//
