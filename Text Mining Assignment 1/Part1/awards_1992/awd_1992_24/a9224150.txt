Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Technical Narrative:                                                           
                                                                                             
              This U.S.-Egypt collaborative research project involving                       
              the University of North Carolina (UNC) and Cairo                               
              University is in the general area of Si-SiGe                                   
              heterostructures.  Project funding will enable the team                        
              from Cairo University to work for various periods of                           
              time in the laboratory of Dr. Sean Washburn at UNC                             
              as well as the IBM Watson Research Center.                                     
              Additionally, Dr. Washburn will spend one week visiting                        
              the laboratory of Dr. Khalid Ismail of Cairo University.                       
              The investigators will perform a series of transport                           
              experiments on small point contacts, lateral resonant                          
              tunneling devices, and interferometers.  The proposed                          
              experiments will (1) extend the study of ballistic                             
              transport to new materials systems, (2) provide a                              
              broader base of experimental data to test theoretical                          
              predictions on ballistic transport, (3) provide the first                      
              system for experimental data for testing recent                                
              predictions of conductance quantization in                                     
              one-dimensional Luttinger liquid, and (4) allow testing                        
              of new predictions for electrostatic interference effects.                     
              This project in materials research fulfills the program                        
              objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling                        
              leading experts in the United States and Egypt to                              
              combine complementary talents and pool research                                
              resources in areas of strong mutual interest and                               
              competence.
