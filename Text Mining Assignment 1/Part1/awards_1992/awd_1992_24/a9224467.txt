Abstract    :
              With the support of this award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic,                 
              and Organometallic Program, Dr. Russell P. Hughes of the                       
              Chemistry Department, Dartmouth College, would continue                        
              investigations on the cleavage and formation of carbon-carbon                  
              bonds promoted by transition metals.  Three projects would be                  
              pursued:  ring-opening in vinylcyclopropene rearrangements;                    
              characterization of eta-3-cyclopropenyl complexes, including                   
              their CO substitution reactions and rotation barriers; and bond                
              cleavage of sterically destabilized cyclopentadienyl ligands.                  
              The latter reactions do not proceed by simple metal insertion                  
              into the carbon-carbon bond.  In order to study the skeletal                   
              rearrangments that occur during the ring opening reactions of                  
              the cyclopentadienyl ligands, selectively isotopically labelled                
              precursors will be prepared.  A 1,2,3,-tri-t-butylcyclopenta-                  
              dienyl ligand has been prepared; advantage will be made of the                 
              incipient strain associated with the compound in order to make                 
              novel compounds.

              By investigating in detail the mechanism of carbon-carbon bond                 
              making and breaking by transition metals, Dr. Russell P. Hughes                
              of Dartmouth College hopes to achieve increased understanding                  
              of this reaction which is important to the petroleum catalyst                  
              industry.  The results could be particularly relevant to the                   
              formation and control of carbon ring compounds.
