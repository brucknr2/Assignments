Abstract    :
              There are approximately 2000 two-girder steel bridges throughout               
              the United States that are 35-40 years old and are subject to                  
              fracture due to age and climate.  Investigation of the potential               
              fracture condition will be pursued by this project, using the I-               
              40 bridge in New Mexico as a case study.                                       
                                                                                             
              The objective of this investigation are three-fold:                            
              1. Investigate the after fracture behavior and the alternate load              
              path present in a two-girder fracture critical bridge.                         
              2. Perform field experiments and evaluation of a new promising                 
              nondestructive evaluation technique.                                           
              3. Develop a state-of-the-art bridge monitoring system.  This                  
              monitoring system will be implemented on the new I-40 bridge in                
              New Mexico.
