Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Technical Narrative:                                                           
                                                                                             
              This proposed conference, organized by the University of                       
              Central Florida and Cairo University, is scheduled for                         
              December 1993 in Cairo, Egypt.  The purpose of the                             
              conference is to report on some of the latest                                  
              developments in the areas of classical and applied analysis                    
              that relate to signal processing and wavelets.  This                           
              combination of topics brings together expertise from many                      
              countries, especially some mathematicians with contacts                        
              and ties with Middle East. This proposal supports the                          
              participation of approximately 15 U.S. mathematicians.                         
              Conference participants will present papers that will be                       
              compiled and published as a conference volume.                                 
                                                                                             
              This conference in mathematical sciences fulfills the                          
              program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by                         
              enabling leading experts in the United States, Egypt and                       
              elsewhere to combine complementary talents and present                         
              research results in areas of strong mutual interest and                        
              competence.  This conference has the potential for                             
              generating new scientific activity and new international                       
              linkages.
