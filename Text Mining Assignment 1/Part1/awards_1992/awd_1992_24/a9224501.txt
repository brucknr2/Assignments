Abstract    :
                   The goal of this research is to better understand the basic               
              physical processes associated with tropical cyclone formation,                 
              structure, and intensity change.  The research will combine                    
              theoretical and observational studies.                                         
                   Research on tropical cyclones is difficult because the storms             
              form and evolve over tropical oceans, notorious data sparse                    
              regions.  Dr. Gray is unique in his approach, relying principally              
              on compositing data from a number of cases as a means of overcoming            
              the problems of insufficient observations.  While this technique               
              has its drawbacks, the research nonetheless has produced some                  
              interesting insights into the behavior of tropical storms and his              
              results have proved stimulating to the community.  Dr. Gray is                 
              recognized as a leader in tropical cyclone research.
