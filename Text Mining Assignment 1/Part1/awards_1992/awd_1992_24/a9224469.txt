Abstract    :
              Professor Ibers of Northwestern University will investigate the                
              synthesis of soluble metal chalcogenide compounds with support                 
              from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic chemistry                 
              Program.  These species are of the type (MxQy)z- where M is a                  
              metal and Q is selenium or tellurium.  The synthetic techniques                
              to be employed are varied, but they will center mainly on                      
              reactions of metal compounds with polyselenide or polytelluride                
              species in non-aqueous solvents or on replacement reactions.                   
              Characterization of the resultant products will be by 77Se and                 
              125Te NMR spectroscopy and by X-ray diffraction studies of                     
              single crystals.

              Simple metal compounds of oxygen and of sulfur that are soluble                
              are widely known.  Much less is known about similar compounds                  
              of those elements lower in the periodic table, selenium and                    
              tellurium.  The first step in gaining such knowledge is the                    
              preparation of the compounds.  Initial studies suggest that                    
              some of these compounds will bear strong similarities to the                   
              corresponding sulfides, but others will represent totally new                  
              structural types.  Thus, a broad range of synthetic methods                    
              will used in a multi-pronged research program directed towards                 
              uncovering the variety of compounds that con be prepared from                  
              these elements.
