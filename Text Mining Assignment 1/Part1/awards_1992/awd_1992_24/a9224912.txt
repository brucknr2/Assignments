Abstract    :
                   The project is concerned with developing problem-solving                  
              software that is based on genetic algorithms (GA) and classifier-              
              systems (CS).  This software models adaptive systems that operate              
              in complex non-linear environments in the following manner:  (1)               
              Goal-directed action involves the construction, testing, and use of            
              internal, forward-predicting models of the environment, and the                
              constant adaptation of such models to the changes of the                       
              environment.  (2)  A tag on a classifier give it a recognizable                
              identity, so classifiers can learn to cooperate, as in a forward-              
              predicting model.  //
