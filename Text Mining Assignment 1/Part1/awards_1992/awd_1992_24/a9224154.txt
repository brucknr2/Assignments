Abstract    :
              Christie         Recent advances in statistical physics based on the concept  of
              the renormalization group are applied to the problem of  computer
              interconnection optimization.  This enables a  thermodynamic model of system
              connectivity to be developed which  is consistent with the hierarchical
              boundary conditions imposed  by the rack-board-chip method of computer
              construction.  From  this theoretical description a new optimization algorithm,
              called  geometrical annealing, is proposed.  In contrast to other 
              thermodynamically based algorithms, geometrical annealing  acknowledges the
              spatial relationships that exist between optimal  wire length arrangements by
              employing minimization routines based  on geometrical principles.  It is
              anticipated that this property  may hold the key to matching the performance of
              experienced human  designers who naturally employ their spatial awareness in 
              producing efficient wiring layouts.  Other benefits of this  research will
              include a deeper understanding of the relationship  between statistical
              mechanics and combinatorial optimization, the  thermodynamic justification of
              the power-law relationship between  connectivity and system size, known as
              Rent's rule, and the  development of new thermodynamic relationships between
              the  parameters which characterize hierarchically structured systems.
