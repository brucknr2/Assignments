Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a project to measure subglacial water             
              pressure, turbidity, electrical conductivity, and flow velocity                
              beneath a non-surge type glacier for a continuous period lasting               
              two full years.  Measurements will be made directly at the glacier             
              bed in boreholes having known trajectories.  The data that is                  
              collected will be used to test and refine existing theories of                 
              subglacial drainage, and to construct and verify a generalized                 
              model of basal hydrology.
