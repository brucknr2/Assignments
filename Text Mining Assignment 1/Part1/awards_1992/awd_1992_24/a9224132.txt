Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a two year project to extend a strain             
              network, established by a European group, 30 km downstream from the            
              GISP2 drilling site in order to provide additional data needed for             
              modeling of the ice flow at the GISP2 site.  The ice flow modeling             
              is needed to provide information on the depth-age relationship of              
              the deepest ice where annual layers are lost.  This information is             
              critical for dating the deep ice of the GISP2 core.
