Abstract    :
              9224858  Lincoln  Logical elegance and execution speed are typically thought to
              be  incompatible traits of declarative programs, but recent  developments in
              resource-conscious logics indicate that it might  be possible to resolve this
              tension.  Type systems for functional  languages based on linear logic can be
              exploited by compilers to  generate optimized target code.  Linear logic can
              also be used as  a computational framework for logic programming.  Logic 
              programming calculi will be enriched with control and update  primitives
              inspired by the linear connectives.  Insights from  logic, type theory, and
              automated reasoning will enhance both the  expressiveness and execution speed
              of declarative programming  languages.  ***
