Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Description:  This project provides support for                                
              a short field study by Dr. Frederick Asher in                                  
              India.  He will collect and analyze samples                                    
              that will be used as the basis for a                                           
              petrographic study of stone artifacts in                                       
              eastern India, defined as Bihar and Bengal,                                    
              including Bangladesh.  The study seeks the                                     
              identification of the sources of rocks used in                                 
              the production of religious artifacts of                                       
              various dates and provenance within eastern                                    
              India.  This area was drawn together under the                                 
              Pala dynasty, between the 9th and 12th                                         
              centuries, when most of the artifacts were                                     
              made.  The determination of the sources of                                     
              stones can lead to identification of economic                                  
              and cultural patterns.                                                         
                                                                                             
              Scope: The project will be carried by Dr. Asher                                
              with support from the Archeology Department of                                 
              India.  The study can lead to establishing                                     
              petrographic studies of artifacts as a viable                                  
              method for establishing the sources of stones                                  
              used in these artifacts, as well as to tracing                                 
              patterns of trade and economic and cultural                                    
              zones.  The project fits the objectives of the
