Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective of this project is to investigate the influence of               
              chirality on phases and phase transitions in liquid crystals                   
              through the use of optical activity and light scattering                       
              measurements.  Previous work has demonstrated that high chirality              
              has a significant effect on both the phases which form in liquid               
              crystals and the transition between phases.  This project seeks to             
              extend this work by:  (1) performing similar optical activity and              
              light scattering measurements in a new liquid crystal system to see            
              if the previously observed effects of chirality are universal or               
              compound specific:  (2) employing dynamic light scattering to probe            
              the time evolution of the complex fluctuations which occur in some             
              phases and near phase transitions in highly chiral liquid crystals;            
              and (3) investigating the fluctuations which take place in highly              
              chiral liquid crystals at phase transitions induced by electric                
              field.  The goal in all these studies is to determine the limits of            
              the present theoretical ideas concerning chiral liquid crystals and            
              to suggest ways they may be extended to properly describe highly               
              chiral systems.
