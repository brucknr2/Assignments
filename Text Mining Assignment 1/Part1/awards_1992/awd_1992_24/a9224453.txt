              The University of Hawaii (UH) requests funding to purchase                     
              shipboard instrumentation in support of NSF-funded research.  The              
              instruments will be used aboard the research vessel MOANA WAVE, a              
              210' vessel that is owned by the Navy and operated by the                      
              University.  All of the instruments are for shared-use by a wide               
              variety of scientists.  Funding will include the acquisition of                
              shipboard computer upgrades, a CTD, and a thermosalinograph.
