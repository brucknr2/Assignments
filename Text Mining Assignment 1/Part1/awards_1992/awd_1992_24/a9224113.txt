Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Graduate student Edmund Crane, under the supervision of                   
              advisers Jonathan Wendel and Donald Farrar at Iowa State                       
              University, seeks to clarify the taxonomic delimitation of species             
              and genera in the tropical fern family Vittariaceae and to infer a             
              phylogenetic framework for the relationships among these taxa.  The            
              phylogenetic study will focus both on morphological features of                
              these ferns and on DNA sequence data from chloroplast genes.  The              
              ferns are mostly tropical epiphytes, a group little studied with               
              respect to DNA variation within and among species.  Geographic                 
              outliers include the strange "Appalachian gametophyte," Vittaria               
              appalachiana, which is widespread in the eastern U.S. but found                
              solely as the asexual, clonal haploid stage or gametophyte and not             
              known in the wild in the sexual, diploid spore-forming stage.  Gene            
              sequence data from samples representing a wide range of fern                   
              families will be analyzed to determine the likely genealogical                 
              position of the Vittariaceae among the leptosporangiate ferns.  The            
              results of the interfamily analysis will then be used to assess the            
              likely derivation of morphological traits within the Vittariaceae.             
              Both morphological and molecular datasets will be integrated in the            
              interpretation of evolutionary pathways in these plants.
