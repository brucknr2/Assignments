Abstract    :
              9224765  Block       This award is for partial support of junior investigators
              in  particle physics to enable them to attend the twenty third in  a series of
              symposia in September at Aspen, Colorado.  These  symposia are typically
              attended by approximately 125  physicists, and cover a wide range of topics. 
              The last two  symposia in the series have been in Santiago di Campostela, 
              Spain (1992) and in Wuhan, China (1991).  The topics to be  covered in the
              symposium, planned for September 12-17, 1993,  are of current interest to all
              particle physicists.  ***
