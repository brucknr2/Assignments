Abstract    :
                   Boshernitzan will continue his work in ergodic theory and                 
              combinatorial number theory.  He will study the homogenous                     
              ergodicity property that dynamical systems may satisfy, pseudo-                
              Anosof interval exchange maps, alpha-rotations with alpha having               
              bounded partial quotients, and symbolic flows coming from                      
              substitutions.  The study will lead to quantitative estimates on               
              how well the orbits of the above mentioned dynamical systems are               
              uniformly distributed.                                                         
                   This project involves research in ergodic theory.  Ergodic                
              theory in general concerns understanding the average behavior of               
              systems whose dynamics is too complicated or chaotic to be                     
              followed in microscopic detail.  Under the heading "dynamics                   
              can be placed the modern theory of how groups of abstract                      
              transformations act on smooth spaces.  In this way ergodic theory              
              makes contact with geometry in its quest to classify flows on                  
              homogeneous spaces.
