Abstract    :
              The area of flavins and flavoproteins is a broad, but clearly and              
              simply defined one.  It covers all aspects of work pertaining to               
              the chemistry and biology of compounds based on the isoalloxazine              
              nucleus and on a very few closely related structures.  Because of              
              the extraordinary versatility of flavins as a prosthetic group                 
              and its involvement in a variety of important biological                       
              oxidation and reduction processes, this area continues to expand               
              rapidly.  Interest in flavins ranges from theoretical chemistry                
              to medical aspects.                                                            
              %%%                                                                            
              The 11th International Symposium on Flavins and Flavoproteins                  
              will be held in Nagoya, Japan in 1993 as one of a series which                 
              has been organized at 3 year intervals since 1965.  Because of                 
              the continued and increasing pace of research in this area, it is              
              important that regularly scheduled meetings be held.  The attempt              
              has been to plan such symposia at three year intervals in order                
              to maximize communication of the rapidly acquired new knowledge,               
              allow timely adjustments on best directions to follow and                      
              stimulate new research.  Review lectures will cover the entire                 
              field and the meeting will bring together scientists from all                  
              over the world from a wide variety of disciplines and promote                  
              valuable discussion and exchange of information.
