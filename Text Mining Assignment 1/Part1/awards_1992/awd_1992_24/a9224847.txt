Abstract    :
              This research is a 24 month extension of a study of decision-making            
              by sentencing jurors in capital cases.  The current project is                 
              designed to examine a recent constitutional development that                   
              promises to alter both the content and tone of sentencing hearings             
              in capital cases.  In Payne v. Tennessee (1991) the U.S. Supreme               
              Court held that personal characteristics of the victim and the                 
              emotional impact of the crime on the victim's family, friends and              
              community can be presented to sentencing jurors.  Since prior                  
              holdings of the Court had excluded such information, Payne,                    
              therefore, changed the rules that determine what information jurors            
              could hear in the sentencing phase of capital cases.  The ruling               
              came at the very end of the sampling time frame for the original               
              study.  This timing affords a unique opportunity to study the                  
              possible effects on juror decision processes of allowing jurors to             
              hear emotional "victim impact" testimony.                                      
                                                                                             
              Interviews will be conducted with a sample of 360 jurors (four                 
              randomly selected jurors each) from 90 trials conducted since the              
              Payne ruling became effective.  In addition to the juror                       
              interviews, the prosecuting and defense attorneys who tried these              
              cases will be interviewed and transcripts of the sentencing phase              
              of the trials will be obtained for data on the character of the                
              evidence and arguments to which jurors were exposed, and other data            
              on the proceedings for comparison and statistical control.                     
              Completed interviews with jurors from 360 cases tried under the                
              prior evidentiary rules will serve as the baseline for assessing               
              the effects of Payne on sentencing behavior.  The same interviewing            
              procedures and instruments covering juror sentencing decisions will            
              be used for comparability between the pre- and post-Payne cases.
