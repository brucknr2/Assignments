Abstract    :
                   Zeta functions play a well-recognized role in many areas of               
              mathematics.  In 1992-93, the Japan-US Mathematical Institute at               
              Johns Hopkins University is hosting a special year on zeta                     
              functions in number theory and in geometric analysis.  This award              
              is for a conference to be held March 29- April 3,1993, to bring                
              together researchers in these subjects.  Visitors to Hopkins                   
              during Spring 1993 in areas related to number theoretic zeta                   
              functions include A. Gyoja, T. Kimura, D. Meuser, F. Sato, and T.              
              Yano.  Visitors in areas related to the geometric analysis                     
              aspects include T. Adachi, A. Katsuda, Y. Petridis, and T.                     
              Sunada.  One connection between these two areas is the study of                
              zeta functions associated to quotients of symmetric spaces, e.g.               
              in the spectral theory of automorphic forms.  Another is the                   
              study of the fine structure of the zeroes of various L-functions,              
              which resembles that of the eigen-values of various Laplacians.                
              A more informal connections is that the principal researchers in               
              these areas often have an intense interest in the strong                       
              analogies between their work and that in areas not directly                    
              related.  We will describe the two areas separately below, but in              
              the second part (zeta functions in geometric analysis) we will                 
              try to indicate some of the overlap between number-theoretic and               
              geometric-analytic zeta functions.                                             
                   This project proposes a conference on zeta functions in                   
              number theory and geometric analysis, with emphasis on the                     
              following subjects: (i) zeta functions of prehomogeneous vector                
              spaces and Igusa zeta functions; (ii) the zeta functions which                 
              arise in the spectral theory of the Laplacian.  The proposed                   
              conference is planned so as to take advantage of the                           
              concentration of experts in these areas present at Johns Hopkins               
              in connection with the concentration year held by the Japan-U.S.               
              Mathematical Institute.
