Abstract    :
              Dr. Leonard W. Fine and other members of the Chemistry Department              
              of Columbia University are being supported to continue a Research              
              Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry.  For the               
              period 1993-5, ten undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each            
              summer actively engaged in a variety of research projects.                     
              Projects cover the traditional areas of chemistry-analytical,                  
              inorganic, organic, physical and biochemistry.  A unique feature of            
              this program is regular field trips to visit industrial                        
              laboratories and their research staff.
