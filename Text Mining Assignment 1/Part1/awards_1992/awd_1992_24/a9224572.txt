Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is a study of the economic and social factors that shaped            
              death rates for various causes during industrialization in                     
              nineteenth century New England.  It will focus on the period 1850-             
              1910 in six communities of western Massachusetts, linking vital                
              statistics registers with census manuscript schedules to achieve a             
              panel design.  The study will address specific hypotheses                      
              concerning the effects of changes in occupational diversity and the            
              distribution of wealth on mortality, while controlling for other               
              demographic and health influences.                                             
                                                                                             
                   Studies in historical demography, such as this one, are among             
              the most scientific contributions to American History, and they use            
              historical data to answer general questions about changes in                   
              population dynamics.  This research will help us understand how                
              social and economic factors led to substantial decreases in death              
              rates in the United States, providing a solid comparative framework            
              for interpreting trends in developing nations today.
