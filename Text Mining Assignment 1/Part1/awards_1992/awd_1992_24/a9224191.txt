Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The radio astronomy program under the direction of the                         
              Principal Investigator, Professor Bernard F. Burke, will                       
              concentrate on the study of extragalactic radio sources,                       
              with particular emphasis on the study of the gravitational                     
              lensing phenomenon.  The first phase of the study, which                       
              involved the mapping of 4000 radio sources with the VLA, has                   
              been completed, and that work has resulted in the discovery                    
              of at least six new examples of gravitational lensing.  The                    
              gravitational time delay effect has been utilized to give an                   
              independent evaluation of the Hubble constant, and to                          
              explore the large-scale geometry of the universe.                              
                                                                                             
              A new class of gravitational lenses, called "Einstein Rings"                   
              has been identified.  Three have been found, and a search                      
              will be made for more of these objects.  These objects are                     
              of particular importance since they allow definitive                           
              measurements of galactic masses to be made.                                    
                                                                                             
              During the period of the grant two new radio source surveys                    
              will take place, one using the Very Large Array (VLA) in                       
              Socorro, New Mexico, and the other to locate sources using                     
              the Parkes 210-foot telescope in Australia.  This will be                      
              followed up by use of the Australia telescope                                  
              interformeteric array to look for gravitational lenses.                        
                                                                                             
              In addition to these programs, the Principal Investigator                      
              will continue a program that uses the VLA survey material to                   
              search for high-redshift radio galaxies and quasars, and to                    
              study their radio properties.                                                  
                                                                                             
              The Principal Investigator is regarded as a world leader in                    
              this research area.
