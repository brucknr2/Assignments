Abstract    :
                   Analyses of light stable isotopes in bulk organic                         
              matter and major compound classes are widely used by organic                   
              geochemists to assess the origin and thermal maturity of                       
              fine-grained sedimentary rocks.  In the last five years, it                    
              has become possible to determine the carbon isotopic                           
              composition of individual organic compounds using                              
              instruments with a gas chromatograph coupled to an isotope                     
              mass spectrometer.  Application of isotope ratio monitoring                    
              of individual compounds (IRM/GC-MS) to a wide range of                         
              geological problems is beginning to emerge.  PIs will                          
              utilize IRM/GC-MS for a direct comparison of the isotopic                      
              composition of lipid biomarkers (organic molecular fossils)                    
              between soft tissues and organic matter within mineralized                     
              tissues of bivalve shells.  Both living shells and fossil                      
              shells will be surveyed.  If sufficient quantities of lipids                   
              can be extracted from shells and if lipids from the shell                      
              mimic the isotopic composition of the mantle tissues, then                     
              it should be feasible to use shell lipids for studies of                       
              molecular paleontology and paleoecology.
