Abstract    :
              9224864  Wood  This proposal is on research to  investigate enhanced plasmid 
              stability by using multiple killer  genes.  Enhanced plasmid stability  can be
              useful for a higher level of  expression of recombinant protien  products in E.
              coli and for  effective genetic engineering  strategies for waste treatment and
               bioremediation.  The two main points  to be examined include:  (1) the  role
              of media composition and  temperature on plasmid stability;  and (2) the effect
              of using two  killer genes for enhanced stability.   Experiments in both
              chemostat and  shake - flask cultures will be  performed. In addition, some 
              modeling will also be performed.  ***
