Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award provides funds to the Psychology Department of Clark                
              University to continue an REU-Site project designed to build upon              
              and make more effective a formal curriculum known as the Research              
              Apprenticeship Program.  The training model features                           
              apprenticeship, hands-on teaching for a ten week period where                  
              students learn by actively participating in all phases of a                    
              research study including:  problem formulation, data collection and            
              analysis, presentation at a professional meeting, manuscript                   
              preparation, and publication.  Eight students, recruited                       
              nationally, will work with one of 19 faculty associates, whose                 
              interests collectively address biological, psychological, and                  
              sociocultural aspects of behavior.  Research projects represent the            
              full spectrum of scholarship in psychology, from neuroanatomy to               
              literary analysis, from work with animals to studies of peoples in             
              foreign cultures.                                                              
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to               
              attract talented students into careers in science through active               
              undergraduate research experiences.
