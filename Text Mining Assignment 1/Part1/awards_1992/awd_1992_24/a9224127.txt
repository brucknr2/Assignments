Abstract    :
              9224127  Hall  This award supports Professor H. K. Hall, Jr. and two
              postdoctoral  research associates from the University of Arizona to collaborate
              in  polymer chemistry research with  Dr. H. G. Korth and Professor R.  Sustmann
              of the Institute for Organic Chemistry of the University of  Essen, Germany. 
              They are interested in the mechanism of initiation  of spontaneous
              polymerizations that occur when electron-rich and  electron-poor olefins are
              mixed.  Theoretical work and kinetic  studies on polymers by the U.S. group
              suggest that there is an  intermediate form which may be a diradical.  This in
              turn initiates  the formation of bonds and produces the polymer.  The missing
              link to  confirm the theory is the direct observation of the initiating 
              diradicals; this would be possible with electron-spin resonance (ESR) 
              spectroscopy.  The German participants in the project contribute  substantial
              expertise in ESR that will make it possible to observe  and identify these
              elusive diradical species.    This research addresses a fundamental question in
              polymers research.   The U.S. investigator has made important and
              ground-breaking  contributions toward understanding what initiates certain
              types of  polymerization reactions.  The proposed collaboration with German 
              investigators will produce new information on this complex process  and enhance
              his productive and innovative research program.  ***
