Abstract    :
              It is proposed to develop a two-course sequence on particle                    
              technology, and to offer it as an option in the Chemical                       
              Engineering curriculum at CUNY.  Both theoretical and                          
              experimental aspects will be covered.  The particle technology                 
              laboratory will be equipped with new instrumentation, with funds               
              co-sheared by the university and industry.  Two other courses                  
              from the graduate curriculum.  Fluidization and Fluid Particle                 
              Systems, will be adapted for the undergraduate students in order               
              to provide a continuation of the new two-course sequence.  The                 
              program will be open and advertised to all interested                          
              universities and industrial companies.                                         
                                                                                             
              The course will fill the need for training specialists in the                  
              area of particle science and technology for materials synthesis                
              and processing, manufacturing of bulk chemicals, mineral                       
              processing, pharmaceutical and other industrial processes.
