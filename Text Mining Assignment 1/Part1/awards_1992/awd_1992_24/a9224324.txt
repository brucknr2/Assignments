Abstract    :
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work of              
              Professor Plummer at Trinity University, who will synthesize                   
              cyclopentene fused polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that are                   
              deformed from their normal planar geometries as verified by X-ray              
              analyses. The ground and excited state properties of these deformed            
              aromatic molecules will be studied experimentally and compared with            
              semi-empirical molecular orbital and molecular mechanics                       
              calculations. Their photochemistry will be pursued to study the                
              mechanism and the effect of ground state strain energy on excited              
              state transformations. The syntheses of measurable temporal domain             
              zwitterionic cation radical-anion radical species is also targeted.            
              The potential for selected compounds to be used in molecular                   
              devices will be explored.

              Non-planar aromatic hydrocarbons are recognized as important new               
              compounds with many intriguing chemical and physical properties. In            
              this project Professor Plummer and his undergraduate students will             
              synthesize many new compounds, determine their non-planar                      
              geometries by X-ray analyses, investigate their photochemical                  
              properties, and provide an extensive computational survey on their             
              physical-organic features.
