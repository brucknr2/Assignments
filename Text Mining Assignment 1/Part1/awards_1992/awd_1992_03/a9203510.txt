Abstract    :
                   This award supports research on problems in the theory of                 
              quadratic forms and the theory of finite-dimensional division                  
              algebras.  Questions considered involve determining the structure              
              of bilinear spaces (more precisely the Knebusch-Witt ring) over                
              algebraic curves, in particular elliptic curves.  A second set of              
              problems involves studying the non-tame valuation theory of                    
              division algebras, in both finite and mixed characteristics.                   
              Both subjects are intimatley related to Galois cohomology, and                 
              therefore problems in Galois theory will be considered as part of              
              the research.                                                                  
                   The research supported involves the theory of quadratic                   
              forms.  This, in its simplest form, is the study of polynomial                 
              forms of degree two.  Equivalently, it is an analysis of the                   
              types of inner products that can define the metric geometry of an              
              n-dimensional vector space.  The study of quadratic forms has                  
              deep interrelations with algebraic geometry and algebraic                      
              k-theory.
