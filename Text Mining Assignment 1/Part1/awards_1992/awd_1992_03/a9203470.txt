Abstract    :
              This project will attempt to quantify the effects of sea ice and               
              ice transport on the presence and persistence of high latitude                 
              oceanic salinity anomalies, and , more generally, on the                       
              circulation of the global oceans.                                              
                                                                                             
              Past global modelling efforts have included only rudimentary ice               
              dynamics and thermodynamics, while sea ice models have generally               
              neglected the large-scale oceanic effects of the sea ice.  This                
              project will couple an ice-ocean model that includes full sea ice              
              dynamics to a baroclinic ocean model.  By varying the fraction of              
              the included global ocean, the sea ice effect can be explicitly                
              demonstrated.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              A series of numerical studies will be concerned with the question              
              of how critical ice export, or equatorward ice transport, is on                
              regional salinity budgets, and how much of a variation in the ice              
              budget can affect the thermohaline circulation of geographically               
              realistic ocean basins.  After separate studies of the northern and            
              southern hemisphere ice-ocean circulation models, a complete model             
              will be constructed for the Atlantic Ocean.  With this model it is             
              anticipated that an asymmetrical global mode of the thermohaline               
              circulation can be obtained, which may then be perturbed in order              
              to assess the global-scale effect of modified ice transport from               
              the Arctic Basin and the Antarctic circumpolar region.
