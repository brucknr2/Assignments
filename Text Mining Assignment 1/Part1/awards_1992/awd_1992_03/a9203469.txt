Abstract    :
                   Professor Gouvea will work on several problems connected                  
              with the theory of p-adic modular forms.  In particular, he will               
              study conjectures on the existence of modular forms connected by               
              congruence conditions.  He will also work on the arithmetic                    
              properties of elliptic curves in twisted families.                             
                   This project falls into the general area of arithmetic                    
              geometry - a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of                    
              mathematics: number theory and geometry.  This combination has                 
              proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems              
              that withstood generations.  Among its many consequences are new               
              error correcting codes.  Such codes are essential for both modern              
              computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
