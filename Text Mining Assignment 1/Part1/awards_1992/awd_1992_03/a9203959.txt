Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              Roanoke College requests support from NSF for connection of its                
              campus network to VERnet.  VERnet is the midlevel network located              
              in the state of Virginia. VERnet will provide operations                       
              management and information services and it will give Roanoke                   
              College connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million               
              bits per second) National Backbone network.                                    
                                                                                             
              The College needs greater functionality and network speed to be                
              able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers              
              along with being able to implement a more reliable mail system.                
              Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.  This                
              is also a unique opportunity for the school to explore innovative              
              educational resources.***//
