Abstract    :
              An International Symposium on Molecular Biology and Function of                
              Carrier Proteins will be held in September 1992 at the Marine                  
              Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, under                      
              auspices of the Society of General Physiologists.  The                         
              Symposium will focus on the molecular biology and structure-                   
              function relationships of membrane carriers, namely uniporters,                
              symporters and antiporters, contrasting their modes of                         
              operation with those of channels and pumps.  The overall aim of                
              the Symposium is to integrate the physiological, biochemical                   
              and genetic approaches to the study of this class of membrane                  
              transport proteins, and to provide a focus for discussion of                   
              emerging strategies to determine how carrier proteins actually                 
              work. Twenty two lectures will be distributed in five sessions:                
              1) Structure and Dynamics of Membrane Proteins, 2) Families and                
              Superfamilies of Transport Proteins, 3) MDR, CFTR, and Related                 
              Proteins, 4) Coupled Ion Exchangers and 5) Sodium-Coupled                      
              Cotransporters.  There will also be two poster sessions for                    
              contributed papers and one session (New Ideas, New Faces) of                   
              talks by young investigators.

              Carrier mediated transport contributes to cell nutrition,                      
              regulation of the ionic composition of the intracellular                       
              milieu, cell volume regulation, cell growth, and many other cell               
              functions.  This conference should contribute to the                           
              understanding of this ubiquitous process.
