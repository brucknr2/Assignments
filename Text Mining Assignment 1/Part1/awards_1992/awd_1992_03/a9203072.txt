Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Phase II SBIR award is concerned with increasing the                      
              maximum current that can be carried by superconducting wire.                   
              The superconducting wire material is Niobium-Titanium (NbTi), a                
              material commonly used in superconducting magnets.  The approach               
              is to introduce artificial pinning centers, impurity material                  
              introduced to prevent the movement of magnetic flux lines.   A                 
              factor of 2 in the maximum current carrying capacity of                        
              superconducting wires at medium to high magnetic fields is                     
              sought.  The increase in maximum current carrying capacity                     
              together with the reduction in processing costs through the new                
              approach to introduction pinning centers is expected to reduce                 
              the superconductor costs is such applications as Magnetic                      
              Resonance Imaging in medicine.                                                 
                                                                                             
              The Phase II research is based on Phase I research in which                    
              a record current density of 7500 amperes per square millimeter at              
              3 Tesla, a relatively low magnetic field, was achieved in NbTi.
