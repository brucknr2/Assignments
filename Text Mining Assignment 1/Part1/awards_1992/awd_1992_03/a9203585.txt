Abstract    :
              This is the first year of a postdoctoral fellowship award to                   
              Dr. James Hutchison. Dr. Hutchison received his Ph. D. for work                
              with Dr. James Collman at Stanford and will be working with Dr.                
              Royce Murray at North Carolina. In this laboratory he will                     
              learn a wide variety of analytical techniques and will learn                   
              how to measure small changes in electronic flux in biological                  
              systems. This will help him to pursue his career interests  in                 
              studying synthetic ion channels based on peptide supported                     
              poly-crown ethers.

              This is the first year of a postdoctoral fellowship award to                   
              Dr. James Hutchison. He will be studying the basic processes by                
              which small electrically charged chemical species pass through                 
              biological systems. Such research can have a major impact on                   
              drug design.
