Abstract    :
                   This research focuses on differential equations and                       
              differential geometry.  The research involves the study of                     
              manifolds without conjugate points, sharp isoperimetric                        
              inequalities for manifolds of various dimensions, degenerate                   
              systems of partial differential equations (especially equations of             
              prescribed curvature, the geometry of isospectral manifolds,                   
              certain classes of minimal submanifolds, and certain applications              
              of geometry to physiology.                                                     
                   In general, this research concerns mathematical models of the             
              Riemannian geometry of manifolds.  Some of this research has                   
              application to physiology; for example, the traditional treatment              
              of gallstones is cholecystectomy (removal of the gallbladder).                 
              However, lithotripsy (fragmentation) and dissolution of gallstones             
              has been advanced as an alternative in recent years.  The                      
              investigators on this award are involved in developing a                       
              sophisticated mathematical model which predicts the behavior of                
              fragments in solvent over time.  The model predicts the evolution              
              of the stone/solvent interface and is a modification of the                    
              curvature flow in differential geometry studied by many                        
              researchers.
