Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              The export of organic matter from the ocean's surface is an                    
              important biological and chemical process.  Biologically, this                 
              export feeds most deeper dwelling organisms, and chemically it                 
              influences the exchange of gases like carbon dioxide and oxygen                
              with the atmosphere.  Export usually is defined in terms of carbon.            
              A common approach is to estimate carbon export from a limiting                 
              nutrient such as the new (nitrate) component of total plankton                 
              production by assuming that 6.6 atoms of carbon are exported for               
              each atom of new production.  However, this gear ratio (one of the             
              Redfield ratios) between the surface water carbon and nitrogen                 
              cycles has never been rigorously examined.  Recent measurements in             
              diverse ocean areas indicate that the net change in inorganic                  
              carbon associated with new production exceeds that predicted from              
              the Redfield conversion by more than 50%.  Thus, current concepts              
              or nutrient cycling in the ocean may be seriously flawed and the               
              role or the ocean as a carbon sink and as an O2 source may be                  
              significantly underestimated.  This research represents the first              
              quantitative study of the relationship between new production and              
              net production in terms of both dissolved inorganic carbon and O2              
              with incubation experiments that can isolate the biological                    
              processes from the confounding effects of mixing and gas exchange.             
              These experiments will provide critical relationships that are                 
              needed for more accurate estimates of oceanic carbon and oxygen                
              fluxes.  The differential recycling of carbon and nitrogen as a                
              reason why the Redfield C:N conversion fails in surface water will             
              also be evaluated.
