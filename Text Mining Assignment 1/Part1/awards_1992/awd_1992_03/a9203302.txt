Abstract    :
              An approach to integrating set theory with functional                          
              programming languages is to be investigated.  This includes                    
              both the design of a class of logics and their application in                  
              a system supporting the development of mechanically verified                   
              software.  It is hoped that ideas from set theory can make                     
              constructive type theories more practical, flexible,                           
              expressive and widely applicable.
