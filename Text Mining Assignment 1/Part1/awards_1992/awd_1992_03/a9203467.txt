Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will integrate a new laboratory technique for                     
              identifying organic constituents, applying newly found kinetic                 
              parameters for these constituents, developing a new organic                    
              maturation model on the basis of the kinetic parameters, and                   
              finally integrating the maturation model to develop a predictive               
              tool for modeling basin evolution and hydrocarbon generation.                  
              The ability to transfer the understanding of coal maturation to                
              the maturation of kerogen, which is the most common source for                 
              oil and gas, will be especially useful.                                        
                                                                                             
              Both researchers have extensive research backgrounds and                       
              experience in the chemistry and kinetics of coal reactions.  They              
              have significant publication records, funding support, and                     
              instrumentation and should be able to complete this project                    
              successfully.
