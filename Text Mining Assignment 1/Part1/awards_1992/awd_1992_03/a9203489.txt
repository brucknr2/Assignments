Abstract    :
                   Hawkins, Petersen, and Wierdl will continue to investigate                
              subtle phenomena in the area of almost everywhere convergence in               
              ergodic theory which involve coalescing uncountably many                       
              exceptional sets of measure zero into a single bad set of measure              
              zero, namely random sampling of continuous-parameter stationary                
              processes and ergodic theorems for randomly applied commuting                  
              maps.  A characterization of situations in which the random                    
              ergodic averages always converge almost everywhere would provide               
              a powerful extension of the Random Ergodic Theorem and would also              
              generalize the return times theorem of Bourgain, Furstenberg,                  
              Katznelson, and Ornstein.                                                      
                   This project involves research in ergodic theory.  Ergodic                
              theory in general concerns understanding the average behavior of               
              systems whose dynamics is too complicated or chaotic to be                     
              followed in microscopic detail.  Under the heading "dynamics                   
              can be placed the modern theory of how groups of abstract                      
              transformations act on smooth spaces.  In this way ergodic theory              
              makes contact with geometry in its quest to classify flows on                  
              homogeneous spaces.
