Abstract    :
              The nature and origin of fluids and digenetic solids in                        
              accretionary complexes can be inferred from geochemical, isotopic              
              and mineralogical studies of convergent margins. The Barbados                  
              Ridge, Peru margin, Nankai Trough and New Hebrides island arc to               
              be studied in this project are different in structure, thermal                 
              regime, sedimentology and geochemistry. The objective of the                   
              project is to constrain the fluid-rock interactions in these four              
              contrasting settings and to quantify the flow of water and                     
              solutes through the accretionary prism. Fluids being expelled                  
              from such settings play a key role in controlling the                          
              deformational, thermal, and geochemical evolution of these                     
              margins. A synthesis of the fluid systems will be important in                 
              planning future ODP drilling in accretionary wedges.
