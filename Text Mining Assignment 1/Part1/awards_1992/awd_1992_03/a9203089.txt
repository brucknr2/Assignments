Abstract    :
              This research will use a series of geotechnical centrifuge models              
              to explore the effect on geotextile reinforced constructed soil                
              slope and soil retaining wall stability when the backfill is silt              
              or clay. The four point focus will be on the effects on sloped wall            
              stability of different batter angles; of the drainage                          
              characteristics of the system which includes permeability of the               
              soil, the in-plane permeability of the geotextile, and the vertical            
              spacing between layers of geotextile reinforcement; of the length              
              of reinforcement; and of the addition of lime to the cohesive soil.            
              The ultimate outcome will be the development of a simple analytical            
              tool for design of walls and slopes which are less expansive to                
              construct in areas where granular soils are not readily available.
