                   This project will assist the Association for Women in                     
              Mathematics (AWM) in the dissemination of the career information               
              booklet, Careers That Count.  This project helps to address the                
              national agenda in mathematics and science education by providing              
              information about career opportunities in the mathematical                     
              sciences.
