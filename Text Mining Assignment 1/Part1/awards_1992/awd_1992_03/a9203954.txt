Abstract    :
              This research effort will conduct measurements of primary                      
              production and grazing on cruises to the equatorial Pacific in                 
              1992.  The basic measurement techniques will use the stable isotope            
              13C to assess total carbon production and the dilution technique to            
              measure grazing by microzooplankton.  Measurements will be directed            
              toward quantifying the potential for dissolved organic production              
              by the equatorial upwelling system and providing comparisons for               
              the model simulations.
