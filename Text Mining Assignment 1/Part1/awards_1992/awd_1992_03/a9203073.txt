Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Phase II project addresses the problems in the quality of                 
              images transmitted in a computer environment.  A common problem                
              is the "tile effect" which is introduced by compression of the                 
              signal for transmission and then decompression for viewing.  The               
              principal investigator is developing a new algorithm, called the               
              JPEG/RBC algorithm, which is based on a two source decomposition               
              derived from a noncausal model for image data and fits closely                 
              within the framework of the JPEG standard.  A preliminary version              
              of the algorithm was shown in Phase I to reduce this problem as                
              well as the compressed data rate when compared to commonly used                
              algorithms.  Potential applications include photo ID systems,                  
              medical imaging, intelligence and prepress.
