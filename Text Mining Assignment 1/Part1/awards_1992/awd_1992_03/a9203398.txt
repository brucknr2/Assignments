Abstract    :
                   The principal investigators will continue their work in                   
              differential geometry, hermitian geometry, and differential                    
              topology. In particular, they will study volume-minimizing cycles              
              in Grassmann manifolds, fibrations of spheres by great spheres,                
              stratified spaces, Einstein metrics and symplectic geometry. This              
              award will continue support for one of the strongest programs in               
              differential geometry in the country. In addition to their                     
              research, the principal investigators will be expected to                      
              continue making a strong contribution to education at the                      
              graduate and undergraduate level as well as their work with high               
              school teachers and students.                                                  
                   This award will support research in the general area of                   
              differential geometry and global analysis. Differential geometry               
              is the study of the relationship between the geometry of a space               
              and analytic concepts defined on the space. Global analysis is                 
              the study of the overall geometric and topological properties of               
              a space by piecing together local information. Applications of                 
              these areas of mathematics in other sciences include the                       
              structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas boundaries, and                 
              the large scale structure of the universe.
