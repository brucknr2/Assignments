Abstract    :
              This project will allow publication of a systematic analysis of a              
              group of lacewing insects, the research for which was previously               
              funded by NSF.  This study represents one of the few analyses of               
              this group of insects and the publication of its results will be               
              useful to other systematists, to ecologists and to agricultural                
              applications.
