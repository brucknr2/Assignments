Abstract    :
              Understanding the tectonic framework across the West Antarctic                 
              Rift system is critical for deciphering the evolution of the                   
              Pacific margin of Gondwana; for understanding the characteristics              
              of wide and narrow modes of continental extension; and for                     
              determining the geological controls on the dynamics of the West                
              Antarctic ice sheet, the globe's last great "marine" ice sheet.                
              This award supports an integrated geophysical experiment                       
              including airborne radar and surface altimetry augmented by                    
              satellite imagery, in addition to, airborne gravity and                        
              aeromagnetic measurements within a carefully chosen West                       
              Antarctic corridor.  This corridor covers the western portion of               
              the Byrd Subglacial Basin and the easternmost portion of the                   
              Interior Ross Embayment.  The experimental objectives will be                  
              achieved by imaging the tectonic fabric across the West Antarctic              
              Rift system and characterizing the distribution of sedimentary                 
              basins, volcanic rocks and important ice dynamical boundaries                  
              within this corridor.
