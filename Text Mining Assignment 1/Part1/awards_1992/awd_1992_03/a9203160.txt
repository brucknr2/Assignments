Abstract    :
              The Fellow will model geodetic data and crustal deformation                    
              associated with active magmatic systems.  Kilauea Volcano flows                
              and deforms in response to many complex magmatic and structural                
              processes.  Data collected since 1965 at the Hawaii Volcano                    
              Observatory (HVO) includes inflation and deflation information of              
              summit magma-reservoir, dike injections along rift zones, and                  
              earthquakes originating within the volcanic opening.  The study                
              expects to use the many  repeated measurements of distance,                    
              height, and tilt to establish average rates of deformation, and                
              then to solve for the generating structures and processes.  The                
              Fellow plans to spend her fellowship tenure at the United States               
              Geological Survey at Flagstaff.
