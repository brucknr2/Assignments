Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The nature of hydrothermal venting through submarine ridges on the             
              Juan de Fuca Ridge will be characterized and quantified using                  
              profiles of sediment pore-water chemistry from the very thin                   
              sediment that partially covers the outcrops.  The outcrops will be             
              photographed to determine whether visible vents and biological                 
              communities are present.  Samples of rock,m indurated sediment and             
              hydrothermal precipitates will be taken.  Any hydrothermal                     
              discharge to the overlying water column presumably will be                     
              delineated.
