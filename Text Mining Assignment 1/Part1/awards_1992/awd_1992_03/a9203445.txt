Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor S. Stahl for                
              research in graph theory.  Professor Stahl will study embeddings               
              of graphs on closed orientable surfaces.  In particular, he will               
              attempt to study the genus of a randomly chosen orientable                     
              embedding of a graph.                                                          
                   Graph Theory go back perhaps two hundred years, but only in               
              the last half-century has the field become an active, fertile,                 
              and flourishing branch of mathematics. A graph is a network of                 
              lines ("edges") joining points ("vertices"), thus the language of              
              graphs becomes a natural way of describing interrelationships                  
              among separated objects.  Graph Theory figures most prominently                
              as an essential tool in Communications Theory and Computer                     
              Science.
