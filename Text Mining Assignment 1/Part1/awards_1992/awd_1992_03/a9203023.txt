Abstract    :
              The goal of this effort is to develop a stable electrocatalyst                 
              and gas-diffusion electrode for use in an on-site                              
              electrochemical generator for hydrogen peroxide.  It is                        
              projected that the catalyst/support/gas-diffusion electrode                    
              system under investigation will lead to a hydrogen peroxide                    
              generator capable of operating at 1 volt and 100 milliamperes                  
              per square centimeter; capital costs would be a third and                      
              operating costs a half of those associated with present state-                 
              of-the-art systems.  Optimal performance is determined for                     
              carbon, gold-catalyzed carbon, and gold-catalyzed Ebonex                       
              electrodes.  Units employing these are then scaled up to                       
              electrode areas of 50-100 square centimeters and long-term                     
              behavior studied including cell current efficiency, long-term                  
              electrode stability, and potential chemical interferences.                     
                                                                                             
              On-site hydrogen peroxide generators have applications in a                    
              large number of situations, including pulp and paper                           
              production, textile manufacture, chemical processing, water                    
              treatment, and sanitation.
