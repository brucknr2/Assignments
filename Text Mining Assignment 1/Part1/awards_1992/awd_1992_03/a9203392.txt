Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will help the Department of Chemistry at Franklin and Marshall                 
              College, which is an undergraduate school, acquire, maintain                   
              and operate a Polarized Specular Reflectance  Microspectrophoto                
              meter.  The areas of chemical research that will be enhanced by                
              the acquisition include:                                                       
                                                                                             
              1)  Polarized Specular Reflectance Spectroscopy on Binuclear                   
                  Metalloprotein Models and Porphyrinic One-Dimensional                      
                  Conductors.                                                                
                                                                                             
              2)  Polarized Spectroscopy of Porphyrin Analogs and One-                       
                  Dimensional Porphyrinic Conductors.                                        
                                                                                             
              3)  Polarized Electronic Spectroscopy in the Determination of                  
                  Solvent Effects on Solution Photophysics.                                  
                                                                                             
              4)  Spectroscopic Studies of Metalloprotein Active Sites.                      
                                                                                             
              Polarized specular reflectance spectroscopy is used to study                   
              the spectroscopy of absorption bands, where the spectral data                  
              on structurally defined inorganic complexes correlate the                      
              electronic structure with the geometric features of the metal                  
              complexes.  This correlation provides definitive spectral                      
              assignments which allows the unique electronic structures of                   
              the complexes to be known.
