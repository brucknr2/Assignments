Abstract    :
                   This work will study relativistic field theory models of                  
              hadronic systems at finite density and temperatures.  Sum rule                 
              techniques will be used to establish links between nuclear                     
              phenomenology and the underlying QCD theory of the strong                      
              interaction.
