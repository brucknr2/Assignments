Abstract    :
                   This research is concerned with a study of algorithmic                    
              problems in the theories of groups, semigroups, inverse                        
              semigroups and associative algebras.  Related problems about                   
              automata, varieties and pseudo-varieties will also be considered.              
              Algorithmic problems to be considered include the word problem                 
              for non-periodic semigroup varieties, for finitely based                       
              varieties of associative algebras, for presentations and                       
              varieties of inverse semigroups.  Other problems to be considered              
              include the algorithmic classification of finitely generated                   
              subgroups of free groups via finite inverse monoids, the Rhodes                
              problem for the class of finite groups and the extension problem               
              for finite inverse automata to various pseudo-varieties of                     
              groups.                                                                        
                   This research is in the area of semigroups.  A semigroup is               
              one of the simplest of the abstract mathematical structures,                   
              consisting of a set with one associative operation on it.  The                 
              structure of these very general objects will be investigated.                  
              Applications will be given to various areas of mathematics and                 
              computer science.
