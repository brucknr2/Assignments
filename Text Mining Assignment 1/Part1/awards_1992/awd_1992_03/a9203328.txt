Abstract    :
                   Cold air cyclones are intense cyclonic storms that form on the            
              cold air side of polar fronts and do not fit the classical mold of             
              extratropical cyclones.  The Principal Investigator will study the             
              formation and structure of these storms using both observational               
              and numerical modeling studies.  The Investigator has carefully                
              chosen four specific cases for investigation.  These cases                     
              represent a wide range of cold air cyclone characteristics and                 
              results will provide insight into the different formation                      
              mechanisms and forcing function.                                               
                   Specific research objectives include: examining the dynamical             
              and physical distinctions between different types of cold air                  
              cyclogenesis; delineating the roles played by baroclinic and                   
              diabatic processes; detailing evolving structures of each case;                
              contrasting the characteristics of cold air cyclones to classical              
              extratropical cyclones.
