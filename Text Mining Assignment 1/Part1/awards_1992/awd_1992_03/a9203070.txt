Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              Funds are requested to purchase an ICP-MS to be housed in the                  
              School of Oceanography at the University of Washington.  Access to             
              an instrument of this type does not presently exist in the Seattle             
              area, and there are at least ten active NSF research grants at the             
              University of Washington which would make use of the high                      
              sensitivity and rapid sample analysis capabilities of the                      
              instrument.  Presently identified users are in the School of                   
              Oceanography, the Department of Geological Sciences, and the NOAA-             
              Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratories.
