Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  An extensive study of the electrical conductivity within                  
              Middle Valley on the Juan de Fuca Ridge will be conducted using a              
              deep tow electromagnetic surveying instrument.  Middle Valley is a             
              segment of the mid-ocean ridge crest buried deeply by sediments and            
              hosting a vigorous and well studied hydrothermal system.  The                  
              conductivity measurements constrain two parameters related to                  
              hydrothermal circulation; the temperature gradient, and the                    
              porosity of the sediments.  The study will also investigate the                
              extent of the large sulfide ore bodies within Middle Valley.  In               
              addition, a controlled source will be used to extend the                       
              electromagnetic studies to greater depth.
