Abstract    :
              Dr. Elizabeth M. Sanford has been awarded a Postdoctoral                       
              Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Sanford's doctoral degree was from                
              UCLA under Professor Francois Diederich. She intends to                        
              continue research with Professor Jean Frechet at Cornell. In                   
              Frechet's laboratory, she will learn the synthetic techniques                  
              for creating particularly large structures and characterizing                  
              them. She will also gain experience in the techniques of                       
              polymer chemistry. These skills will help prepare her for her                  
              long-range goal of preparing polyporphyrin dendrimers for the                  
              study of electron transfer.

              The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as                 
              an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the                   
              knowledge and experience of new Ph.D's and attract them into                   
              meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and                       
              teaching.
