Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will study the effect of pressure on                
              hydrogen bonding in hydrogarnets. To do so he will determine the               
              crystal structures at high pressure of four synthetic specimens                
              using a new high-P cell developed for the high-intensity neutron-              
              powder diffractometer at the Los Alamos Scattering Center. This                
              study will indicate whether garnet might be a storage site for                 
              hydrogen in the Earth`s mantle.
