Abstract    :
              Mathematicians frequently illustrate proofs with an                            
              accompanying diagram.  The aim of this endeavor is to                          
              investigate the hypothesis that these diagrams serve as a                      
              proof plan - a high level description of how the proof is to                   
              be carried out.  This will be done by building a computer                      
              program which can interpret diagrams as plans to be followed                   
              by an automated reasoning program.  Preliminary results                        
              suggest that the automated reasoning task is much simplified                   
              by the presence of guidance from the diagram.  The work will                   
              proceed by identifying new theorems to be proved using the                     
              system, and diagrams that may be associated with them, and by                  
              implementing rules for interpreting these diagrams as proof                    
              plans which will then be passed to our automated reasoning                     
              system.  Weaknesses in the existing automated reasoning system                 
              have been identified, and these will also be addressed.
