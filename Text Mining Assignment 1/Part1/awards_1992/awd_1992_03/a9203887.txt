Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The oceanographic instrumentation program supports requests to                 
              acquire instrumentation for the collection, processing and analysis            
              of oceanographic data.  This proposal from Woods Hole Oceanographic            
              Institution requests funding for acquisition of a hybrid QQ                    
              quadrupole tail that will convert an existing High Resolution Mass             
              Spectrometer into a state-of-the-art Magnetic Sector Mass                      
              Spectrometer (MS-MS).  The entire facility will be available for               
              shared-use by the oceanographic research community and will support            
              the research efforts of many NSF-funded scientists.                            
                                                                                             
              The quadrupole extension adds the capability of obtaining                      
              structural elucidation of high molecular weight macromolecules.                
              The PIs are particularly interested in analyzing high-molecular-               
              weight, marine organic materials, such as the products of                      
              chlorophyll decomposition and structural variations of kerogens and            
              polysaccarides.
