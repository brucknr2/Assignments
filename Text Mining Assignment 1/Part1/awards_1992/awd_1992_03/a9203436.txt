Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will extend the modeling of gene               
              amplification to situations in which there is new experimental                 
              evidence.  Some of the aspects of gene amplification to be                     
              considered are integration of extrachromosomal fragments, unequal              
              chromatid exchange, and variable length of repeats in telomeres                
              at the ends of chromosomes.  The mathematical models to be used                
              will include branching processes and random walks.  The models                 
              will be used to estimate the probabilities and transition rates                
              of the events.                                                                 
                   The principal investigator will develop new mathematical                  
              models in genetics.  The goals of this work will be to test if                 
              mathematical models based on previously proposed informal                      
              biological models are sufficient to reproduce experimental                     
              observations in quantitative detail, to provide a better                       
              understanding of the molecular processes, and to suggest new                   
              experiments which would be informative.
