Abstract    :
                   Professor Schwitters, Chairman of the International                       
              Organizing Committee of the 26th International Conference on                   
              High Energy Physics (ICHEP 92).  The conference will be held                   
              in Dallas, Texas, on August 6-12, 1992, on the Campus of

              conference, will continue the tradition of the 'Rochester'                     
              international conferences started by Professor Robert Marshak                  
              at the University of Rochester in 1950.  These conferences,                    
              held every other year under the auspices of the International                  
              Union of Pure and Applied Physics, bring together over 1200                    
              physicists from throughout the world to discuss the latest                     
              results in elementary particle physics research.
