Abstract    :
                   This research concerns three areas of spectral geometry: (1)              
              spectral geometry, trace formulas, and determinants for Kleinian               
              groups, (2) finiteness and compactness theorems for isopectral                 
              Riemannian manifolds, and (3) spectral geometry of free boundary               
              problems.  The research concerns the development of trace                      
              formulas and the study of determinants of Laplacians for                       
              arbitrary geometrically finite discrete groups of hyperbolic                   
              isometries.  The  emphasis is on co-infinite volume groups, and                
              the goal is to understand poles of the scattering operator                     
              geometrically and to study the behavior of the determinant of the              
              Laplacian and Selberg zeta function under deformations.                        
                   This research is in the general area of geometry and, in                  
              particular, Kleinian groups acting on hyperbolic n-dimensional                 
              space.  The research has significance both to geometry and to                  
              mathematical physics.
