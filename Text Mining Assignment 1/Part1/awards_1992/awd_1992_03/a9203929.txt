Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will study the multidimensional                
              hypergeometric functions and applications in representation                    
              theory and conformal field theory. He will use methods from                    
              partial differential equations and geometry to study                           
              representations of an arbitrary Kac-Moodey algebra and their                   
              quantum deformations. Other applications of the research in                    
              hypergeometric functions will be in the areas of algebraic                     
              geometry and algebraic K-theory.                                               
                   This award will support research in the general area of                   
              differential geometry and global analysis. Differential geometry               
              is the study of the relationship between the geometry of a space               
              and analytic concepts defined on the space. Global analysis is                 
              the study of the overall geometric and topological properties of               
              a space by piecing together local information. Applications of                 
              these areas of mathematics in other sciences include the                       
              structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas boundaries, and                 
              the large scale structure of the universe.
