Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award from the U.S.-Brazil Cooperative                                    
              Science Program supports research in chemistry                                 
              to be conducted by Dr. Willie L. Hinze of Wake                                 
              Forest University and Dr. Frank H. Quina of the                                
              Universidade de Sao Paulo in Sao Paulo, Brazil.                                
              The projected research will provide a better                                   
              understanding of micelle-like polymeric systems                                
              and could lead to the development  of new                                      
              mobile/stationary phases for chromatographic                                   
              separation of optically active compounds.                                      
                                                                                             
              The research will focus on the preparation and                                 
              characterization of chiral and non-chiral ionene                               
              surfactants and the evaluation of their ability                                
              to function as chromatographic mobile or                                       
              stationary phases.  The ability of these systems                               
              to catalyze important chromatographic detection                                
              reactions, which would permit enhanced detection                               
              in TLC/HPLC, will be evaluated.  The project                                   
              will couple the talents of Dr. Hinze as an                                     
              analytical chemist with the physical chemistry                                 
              expertise of his Brazilian counterpart.  ***//
