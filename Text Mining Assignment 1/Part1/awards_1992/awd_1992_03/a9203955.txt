Abstract    :
              Detailed and precise pH profiles will be obtained in the equatorial            
              Pacific Ocean in conjunction with CO2 system measurements.  The                
              work entails measurements of spectrophotometric pH on each seawater            
              sample analyzed for total inorganic carbon, CO2 partial pressure,              
              and total alkalinity.  Spectrophotometric alkalinity measurements              
              will permit assessments of the contribution of organic protolytes              
              to seawater total alkalinity.  These measurements will be used to              
              assist in investigations of ocean-atmosphere carbon fluxes.
