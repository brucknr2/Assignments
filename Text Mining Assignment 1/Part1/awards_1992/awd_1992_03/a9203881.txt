Abstract    :
                   Several times a year, usually in the months from May to                   
              September, a mesoscale vortex called the "Catalina Eddy" interrupts            
              the prevailing fair weather patterns of coastal southern California            
              and imposes a dramatically different wind, cloud and temperature               
              regime for up to a week at a time including pollutant transport                
              patterns that radically depart from the usual.                                 
                   From observational analyses, researchers have identified three            
              factors that might have a strong influence on the formation of the             
              eddy.  These are topographic relief, strong northerly airflow and              
              diurnal surface heating.  Under this Research in Undergraduate                 
              Institutions award, the Principal investigator will use a numerical            
              model to simulate the Catalina Eddy for the purpose of better                  
              understanding of the influence of these three factors.
