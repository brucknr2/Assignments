Abstract    :
              The purpose of the workshop will be to examine the role of the                 
              probabilistic models in characterizing geotechnical uncertainties.             
              The workshop will consist of invited "probabilists" (those who                 
              advocate the use of reliability methodology), and                              
              "traditionalists," who will present papers that will examine the               
              reasons for the current state of affairs and will discuss the                  
              possibilities for deriving greater benefit from reliability                    
              methodology.
