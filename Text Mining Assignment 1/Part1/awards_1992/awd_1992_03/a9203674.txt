Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is an individual award for the Postdoctoral Fellowship in                 
              Plant Biology.  The applicant received her Ph.D. from the                      
              University of Minnesota in molecular biology studying a gene family            
              involved in self-incompatibility in Arabidopsis.  She plans to                 
              carry out her postdoctoral fellowship research in the laboratory of            
              Dr. Gerd Jurgens at the University of Munich in Germany.  Her                  
              research entitled "Genetic analysis of pattern formation in the                
              Arabidopsis embryo: establishment of cotyledon position" will                  
              broaden her scientific training into developmental biology.
