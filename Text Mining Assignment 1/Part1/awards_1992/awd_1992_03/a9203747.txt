Abstract    :
              The theoretical objective of the research is to determine if                   
              bifurcations based on continuum damage constitutive equations are              
              good indicators of failure modes.  Both general and discontinuous              
              bifurcations will be determined based on newly formulated                      
              constitutive equations that allow for changes in the elasticity                
              tensor and are more appropriate for quasi-brittle materials that               
              the usual formulations of plasticity.  The experimental phase will             
              provide orientations and widths of failure zones together with                 
              strain fields for specimens subjected to both uniaxial compression             
              and axial compression with lateral pressure.  The use of x-rays                
              will provide whole-field data that cannot be obtained in any other             
              manner.  Specimens will constructed so that their response will be             
              two-dimensional and, therefore, uniquely suitable for real-time x-             
              ray displays.  The experimental data will provide both the insight             
              and the verification necessary to validate the underlying                      
              hypotheses used in the theoretical approach.
