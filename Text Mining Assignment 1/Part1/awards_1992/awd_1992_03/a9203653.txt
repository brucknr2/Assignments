Abstract    :
              Dr. George A. O'Doherty has been awarded a postdoctoral                        
              Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. O'Doherty's doctoral degree was                   
              from Ohio State University under the supervision of Professor                  
              Leo Paquette. Dr. O'Doherty intends to continue his research at                
              Stanford University with Professor Barry Trost. In his                         
              postdoctoral research Dr. O'Doherty will learn about the use of                
              organometallic reagents in organic synthesis. This will help                   
              him towards a career goal of developing novel synthetic organic                
              reactions based on odd electron organometallic reagents and                    
              using them for the construction of large ring compounds.                       
              %%%                                                                            
              The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as                 
              an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the                   
              knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract them into                   
              meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and                       
              teaching.
