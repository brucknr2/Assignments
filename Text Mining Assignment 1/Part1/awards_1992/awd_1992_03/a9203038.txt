Abstract    :
                   Many studies have shown that air pollutants, including                    
              acidic deposition, can affect plants in ways which may be either               
              deleterious or beneficial to phytophagous insects.  However, the               
              biochemical and nutritional basis of such potential effects have               
              not been established.  This represents a crucial gap in our                    
              understanding of the impact of air pollution on plants, as well                
              as our knowledge of the role of host plant quality in insect                   
              plant interactions.                                                            
                   The P.I. hypothesizes that acidic deposition causes                       
              qualitative and/or quantitative biochemical changes in red spruce              
              foliage which alter its nutritional value for spruce budworm                   
              (SBW), Choristoneura fumiferana, thereby impacting the insect's                
              growth, development, and survival.  This hypothesis will be                    
              tested by relating SBW performance to physical and nutritional                 
              characteristics of one of its hosts, red spruce, exposed to                    
              varying levels or natural and artificial acidic fog.                           
                   The results of this study will elucidate the biochemical and              
              nutritional bases of the effects of acidic air pollution on                    
              plant-insect interactions and will provide a better understanding              
              of the impact of these pollutants on forest ecosystems.
