Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal plans to investigate the interfaces between the high             
              Tc superconductor oxide film and other material media.  The high Tc            
              superconductor oxide film, deposited on a yttria-stabilized                    
              zirconia (YSZ) buffered silicon substrate.  This 2-terminal device             
              structure is characterized electrically by the I-V and C-V                     
              measurements.  The high Tc superconductor oxide is of the ytrrium-             
              barium-cupric oxide (YBCO) type.  Deposition is made by the pulsed             
              deposition (PLD) method.  Processing parameters will be varied and             
              the resultant 2-terminal device structures will be probed of their             
              interface bahaviors.                                                           
              %%%                                                                            
              This research will provide information to the understandings of                
              the interfaces between the high Tc superconductor oxide film layer             
              and other material media in a 2-terminal device structure.                     
              Electrical characterization of the 2-terminal device structure,                
              through the I-V and C-V measurements, will provide information                 
              which can suggest future improvements in the performance of the                
              device structure.  It will enhance the potential usefulness of                 
              superconducting devices.
