Abstract    :
              The proposed work would orient small, single crystalline grains of             
              high temperature superconductor (HTSC) powders by exploiting both              
              the magnetic and shape anisotropies, in order to create a bulk                 
              sintered 'granular single crystal' with complete crystalline                   
              alignment.  The potential of this approach for producing high                  
              critical current polycrystalline pellets will be explored by                   
              studying the effects of annealing, residual misalignment, and                  
              surface treatment on the transport properties of these materials.              
              Alternative approaches for maintaining oxygen stoichiometry in the             
              densified materials will be explored.  Detailed pole figure                    
              analyses and microscopic grain boundary studies will be undertaken             
              together with various forms of pinning mechanisms.
