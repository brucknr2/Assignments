Abstract    :
                   A central question in multivariate data analysis is the                   
              number of factors, usually couched in terms of the "true" rank of              
              the covariance matrix.  A variety of optimality criteria can be                
              applied to the sample covariance matrix; and these are in fact                 
              the basis for many standard multivariate inferential procedures                
              including principal components analysis, factor analysis,                      
              multivariate analysis of variance and discriminant procedures.                 
              This research will examine various model selection methods,                    
              giving special attention to robustness.  New approaches to                     
              discriminant analysis will be drawn using ideas from projection                
              pursuit.                                                                       
                   Researchers analyzing observations on many variables simul-               
              taneously face the problem of deciding how many factors are                    
              really important.  The statistical procedures used to assess the               
              e number of important factors needs to be stable in the presence               
              of normal variation present in the data.  This research focusses               
              on desirable new methods to determine the number of such factors               
              and also on methodology to identify interesting features in the                
              data when many variables are observed at the same time for only a              
              moderate number of individuals.
