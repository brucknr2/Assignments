Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The objectives of this research are the measurement of the                
              clear air field of motion and the evolution of the raindrop spectra            
              in selected thunderstorms.  These measurements will be made using              
              two doppler radars at the Arecibo Observatory, Puerto Rico,                    
              including their use as an interferometer.  A third radar (915 MHz),            
              a portable device, will be borrowed to ensure that winds below the             
              cloud base can also be measured.
