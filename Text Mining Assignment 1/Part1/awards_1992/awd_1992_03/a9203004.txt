Abstract    :
              9203004  Berry  We propose the development of portable numerical software 
              (Fortran and C) and management tools for the application of the  latent
              semantic indexing approach to data retrieval from  scientific databases.  The
              software will implement state-of-the-  art iterative numerical methods
              (Lanczos-based and Subspace  Iteration-based) for computing the sparse singular
              value  decomposition as needed on a full spectrum of computer systems  ranging
              from low-end workstations (Sun-4, Machintosh II) to high-  end supercomputers
              (CRAY Y-MP,CRAY-2S).
