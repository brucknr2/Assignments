Abstract    :
              Construction compliance with design                                            
              intentions is an important

              Noncompliance with requirements                                                
              specified in construction drawings                                             
              appears most pervasive in light                                                
              residential construction and other

              severity of noncompliance with

              is not well documented and

              establish quality control policies
