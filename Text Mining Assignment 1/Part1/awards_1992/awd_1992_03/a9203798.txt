Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is an individual award for the Postdoctoral Fellowship in                 
              Plant Biology.  The applicant received his Ph.D. from Harvard                  
              University in molecular genetics of maize B-chromosome.  He plans              
              to carry out his postdoctoral fellowship research in the laboratory            
              of Dr. Virginia Walbot at Stanford University.  His research                   
              entitled "Cold Stress Mechanisms in Maize" will broaden the                    
              applicant's scientific training into plant physiology and                      
              environmental regulation of gene expression in plants.
