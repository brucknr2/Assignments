Abstract    :
                   Kumar will continue his work on equivariant cohomology with               
              generalized coefficients.  He will study a new G-equivariant                   
              cohomology theory of a G-space, where G is a real Lie group.                   
              This new cohomology theory is defined as the cohomology of the                 
              complex which is obtained from the polynomial functions on the                 
              Lie algebras of G by generalized functions on the Lie algebra.                 
              This cohomology is encountered in studying the index theory of                 
              transversally elliptic operators on G-manifolds.                               
                   The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian                 
              mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in                  
              twentieth century mathematics.  As the mathematical vehicle for                
              exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system, the                            
              representation theory of Lie groups has had a profound impact                  
              upon mathematics itself, particularly in analysis and number                   
              theory, and upon theoretical physics, especially quantum                       
              mechanics and elementary particle physics.
