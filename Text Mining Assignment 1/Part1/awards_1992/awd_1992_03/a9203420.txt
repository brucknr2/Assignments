Abstract    :
                   This supplement provides funding for a pilot Teacher                      
              Enhancement Project at Northeastern University.  The project                   
              involves establishing the Center for the Enhancement of Science and            
              Mathematics Education (CESAME).  This Center will be organized                 
              within the framework of the Industry/University Cooperative                    
              Research Center (I/UCRC) model developed by NSF.  CESAME will                  
              differ in one major way from a conventional IUC in that to date                
              IUCs have focused upon fostering research projects conducted by                
              scientists and engineers working in technological areas relevant to            
              industry.  CESAME will be concerned with fostering projects                    
              conducted by teachers and other parties concerned with enhancing K-            
              12 education.  By applying the IUC approach to education, CESAME               
              will systematically disseminate results and nurture the development            
              of "teacher-mentors".  These leaders are vitally needed to spark               
              widespread positive changes in the country's educational system.               
              Another important facet of the proposed Center is the melding of               
              state resources with those of federal and industrial partners.  The            
              Bay State Skills Corporation (BSSC) and the Massachusetts                      
              Corporation for Educational Telecommunications (MCET) will be                  
              active participants in CESAME.  This mixture of state, federal and             
              private sector participation is critical in an area such as pre-               
              college education.                                                             
                   The Program Director recommends Northeastern University be                
              awarded $100,000 for the first year of this pilot Teacher                      
              Enhancement Project.  This project is being co-funded ($50,000) by             
              the Education and Human Resources Directorate, Teacher Enhancement             
              Program.                                                                       
                   Near the end of the first year the Program Director will                  
              review the progress of the Center on a number of criteria,                     
              including the following:  (1) the extent to which the university-              
              industry interaction is developing; (2) the extent to which the                
              support base of $100,000 is met and expanded; (3) the extent to                
              which a robust educational program is developing.  If the review is            
              satisfactory, the Program Director will recommend support of the               
              second year of this continuing award.
