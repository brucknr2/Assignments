Abstract    :
                   Many of the really exciting advances in sciences are now                  
              being made in highly interdisciplinary environments; and many of               
              the important aspects revolve around statistical issues.  This                 
              research project will bring together statisticians and scientists              
              from academic, governmental, laboratory and industrial setting to              
              delineate crucial problems in several scientific areas and to                  
              identify and formulate the needed statistical research..
