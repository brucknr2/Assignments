Abstract    :
              This research is concerned with the development of fast                        
              algorithms for constraint satisfaction problem.  Constraint                    
              satisfaction formations are currently used in many ways,                       
              including the generating test of correctness for electronic                    
              circuits, the understanding of line drawings by computer, the                  
              solution of combinatorial problems, and folding of RNA                         
              molecules.  The set of constraint satisfaction problems is one                 
              of the NP complete problem sets, so it is unlikely that a fast                 
              algorithm for all constraint satisfaction problems will ever                   
              be found.  For several hundred years some of the best                          
              researchers have been looking for fast algorithms for NP                       
              complete problems sets, and they have never found an algorithm                 
              that is fast for every problem in an NP complete set.  None                    
              the less, algorithms have been found that are fast for most                    
              problems in certain NP complete problems sets.  This research                  
              is concerned with sets where the importance of the problems in                 
              the sets vary as parameters associated with the set are                        
              varied.  By studying the average running time of particular                    
              algorithms as the parameters are varied, algorithms that are                   
              fast under a wide range of conditions can be found.
