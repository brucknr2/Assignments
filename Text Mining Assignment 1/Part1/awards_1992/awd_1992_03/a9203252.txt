Abstract    :
              Finite element modeling of elasto-plastic rolling and sliding                  
              contact will be extended to the near-surface region so that it                 
              can include surface damage due to repeated loading of individual               
              asperities and surface irregularities.  These irregularities                   
              produce intense spikes in the pressure distribution and result in              
              cyclic plasticity and fatigue damage very close to the contact                 
              surface.  The effects are not addressed by conventional Hertzian               
              theory for smooth contact surfaces and become determining factors              
              in the failure of rolling elements made from advanced materials.               
              The modeling of the effects of irregularities will be extended to              
              also study their effects on bodies with shallow modified surface               
              layers and coatings in order to determine which properties and                 
              dimensions of these layers give optimal rolling element                        
              performance.
