Abstract    :
                   This award is concerned with research on group-theoretic                  
              algorithms with emphasis on procedures for studying groups                     
              defined by finite presentations.  Special attention will be given              
              to improving the performance of two procedures of growing                      
              importance to computational group theory, the Knuth-Bendix                     
              procedure for strings and the Baumslag-Cannonito-Miller                        
              polycyclic quotient algorithm.  The connection between these                   
              procedures and three other fundamental algebraic algorithms,                   
              coset enumeration, the LLL lattice reduction algorithm, and the                
              method of Groebner bases will also be explored.  It is expected                
              that one result of the research will be a new implementation of                
              the Knuth-Bendix procedure for strings, along with careful                     
              documentation, which can be shared with other researchers.                     
                   This project is in the general area of group theory and the               
              computer-aided computational aspects of this field.  There is a                
              growing interest in using computers to answer theoretical                      
              questions in algebra and conversely, algebra is quite useful for               
              the development of algorithms.  This project makes serious use of              
              both the theory and practice of symbolic calculations to solve                 
              real problems in group theory.
