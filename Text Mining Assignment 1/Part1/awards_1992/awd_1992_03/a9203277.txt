Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Laboratory experiments and numerical modeling will be combined to              
              study the shoaling-induced wave breaking in the near-shore                     
              environment. The main focus of the study is the region where                   
              sustained breaking occurs after breaker onset and is the spatially             
              dominant mechanism for wave dissipation on natural beaches.
