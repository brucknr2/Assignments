Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Nanoscale interfaces are examined in both single phase materials               
              and multiphase materials.  The goal is to obtain a better                      
              understanding of the atomic level structure and chemistry of                   
              interfaces in nanostructured materials.  An initial comparison is              
              made between grain boundary structures, energies and hardness in an            
              iron-based alloy as a function of grain size and preparation                   
              technique (gas atomization and mechanical attrition).                          
              Intermetallic alloys and composites are included in the research               
              for comparison to the single phase alloys.  Deformation and grain              
              refinement are followed as a function of mechanical attrition                  
              variables in multiphase alloys, including composites.  Several                 
              techniques are used to characterize the nanostructured state: X-ray            
              diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, high resolution                 
              electron microscopy for interface structure, and differential                  
              scanning calorimetry to measure the stored enthalpy of deformation.            
              %%%                                                                            
              This research examines the processing, structure, and chemistry of             
              nanostructured materials.  This is a new class of materials that               
              can possess unique properties because of the extremely fine grain              
              size developed in the processed structure. The research also                   
              examines the mechanical alloying process used in producing                     
              commercial quantities of metal alloys.
