Abstract    :
              This is an individual award for the Postdoctoral Fellowship in                 
              Plant Biology.  The applicant received his Ph.D. from Michigan                 
              State University working on the molecular biology of the                       
              photosynthetic membrane proteins in Synechocystis.  He plans to                
              carry out his postdoctoral fellowship research in the laboratory of            
              Dr. Allan Bennett at the University of California at Davis.  The               
              proposed research entitled "Analysis of the molecular mechanisms               
              controlling guard cell function" will broaden the applicant's                  
              scientific training into plant cell biology, physiology and                    
              biochemistry.  The applicant plans a 6 month foreign experience in             
              the laboratory of Dr. Goffeau at Universite Catholique de Louvain,             
              in Belgium.
