Abstract    :
              This applicant will study the development of transplanted                      
              immature neurons (nerve cells) in rodents. During                              
              development of the central nervous system, neurons must                        
              migrate from the site where they are formed to the                             
              appropriate place in the brain, and establish very precise                     
              connections to other neurons both within and outside the                       
              immediate vicinity.  Specifically, she plans to study the                      
              integration of donor neurons into host brains that have been                   
              made neuron-deficient.  This work is planned to take place                     
              in the laboratory of Dr. Jeffrey Macklis at Harvard                            
              University.
