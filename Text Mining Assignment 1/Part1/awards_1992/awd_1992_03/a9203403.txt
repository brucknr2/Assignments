Abstract    :
                   This project will support a six week summer program for 24                
              women undergraduates, selected nationwide, which would provide                 
              them with an intensive immersion in mathematics designed to                    
              motivate them and strengthen their preparation for entrance into               
              a doctoral program in mathematics after graduation.  The program               
              will also seek to broaden and strengthen the efforts of the                    
              nation's mathematics faculty to encourage more women to major in               
              mathematics and to direct the most promising students to graduate              
              school.  The program will also encourage participating students                
              to serve as leaders in mathematical activities among their peers               
              at their own institutions.  Finally, data will be gathered and                 
              analyzed with a view to clarifying the reasons why many fewer                  
              women mathematics majors than men currently go on to doctoral                  
              programs in mathematics.
