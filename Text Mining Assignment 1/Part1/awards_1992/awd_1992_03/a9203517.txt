Abstract    :
                   Brylinski intends to continue his work on the geometric                   
              construction of characteristic classes and on explicit integer-                
              valued Cech cocycles for them.  He expects to develop general                  
              methods to construct cohomology classes for the gauge groups and               
              groups of diffeomorphisms.  He will also continue his study of the             
              geometry and topology of knots in a smooth manifold, with emphasis             
              on the action of the group of unimodular diffeomorphisms.  He will             
              analyze rigorously some topological quantum field theories, using              
              line bundles on moduli spaces.                                                 
                   The details of these parts vary, but all are concerned with               
              reducing geometric information to a subject for calculation.  The              
              nature of the geometric information involved is the crux of the                
              difficulty.  While questions about lengths, areas, angles, volumes,            
              and so forth virtually cry out to be reduced to calculations, it is            
              far different with what are known as topological properties of                 
              geometric objects.  These are properties such as connectedness                 
              (being all in one piece), knottedness, having no holes, and so                 
              forth.  All systematic study of such properties, for example, how              
              to tell whether two geometric objects really differ in respect to              
              one of these properties or are only superficially different, or how            
              to classify the variety of differences that can occur, all these               
              have only truly been comprehended and mastered when they have been             
              reduced to matters of calculation.
