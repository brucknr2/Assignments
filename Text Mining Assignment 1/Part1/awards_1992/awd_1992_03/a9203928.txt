Abstract    :
              The work carried out at Yale during                                            
              the last three years has resulted                                              
              in a number of neural network                                                  
              models for the identification and                                              
              control of nonlinear dynamical                                                 
              systems.  It has also raised                                                   
              numerous theoretical and practical                                             
              questions concerning the prior                                                 
              information that will be needed to

              well as to assure its robustness in                                            
              more complex environments.  To
