Abstract    :
                   Ignoring the errors in the explanatory variables, as in                   
              classical least squares, can introduce serious bias in the fitted              
              function.  This research will incorporate partial information                  
              from various sources using either Bayesian or frequentist                      
              techniques or combinations, will evaluate the resultant                        
              methodologies, and will apply these methods to measurement error               
              problems arising in chemistry and environmental monitoring.                    
                   Regression models describe relationships among explanatory                
              and response variables.  When the explanatory variables are also               
              subject to random error, the regression model may be                           
              systematically distorted unless special analyses are used.  This               
              research will extend these special analyses to incorporate                     
              information about the reliability of the explanatory variables.                
              The new methods for analysis should find application in chemistry              
              and environmental monitoring (to be tried as part of this                      
              research), astronomy, medicine and behavioral science.
