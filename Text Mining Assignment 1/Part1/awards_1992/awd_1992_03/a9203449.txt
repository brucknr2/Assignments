Abstract    :
              9203449  Post    Because present costs of plasma enhanced chemical vapor 
              deposition diamond films re technology is the attainment of high  deposition
              rates of good quality material.  Diamond coatings for  cutting tools, heat
              sinks for thermal management, and free-  standing thick infrared (IR) optics
              are a few applications in  which high deposition rates are crucial.  Diamond
              deposition  processes using a high power density microwave reactor were 
              developed in Phase I to obtain deposition rates of 15 um/hr.   These rates are
              one order-of-magnitude larger than previously  possible in similar systems
              operating at lower power.  These  Phase I results demonstrated that operation
              at high power  densities opens a completely new operating regime for microwave 
              based deposition reactors.  In this research, an experimental  program is
              undertaken aimed at understanding the gas phase,  chemistry changes at high
              power densities, to develop techniques  to control film morphology, and to
              increase the growth rates to  50 um/hr.  Such understanding would lead to
              increased confidence  on the scale-up of diamond deposition reactors as one
              would be  able to identify which are the most important parameters which 
              control deposition rates.  ***
