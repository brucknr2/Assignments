Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The magnetic properties of cores from fine-grained sediments              
              will be studied from two shallow-marine basins near Nova Scotia:               
              the Emerald and LaHave basins.  Geomagnetic paleosecular variation             
              and rock-magnetic properties will be combined with existing                    
              lithologic, micropaleontological and seismic data to determine a               
              higher level of late Quaternary stratigraphy.
