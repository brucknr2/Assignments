Abstract    :
              An invitational workshop with national and international experts               
              is planned to review and discuss current practice, research needs,             
              and emerging technologies in structural connections for buildings.             
              The workshop will focus on the needs for the construction industry             
              in the three areas of steel, concrete, and mixed (steel and                    
              concrete) construction.  The planned workshop would encourage a                
              crossover of knowledge among disciplines.                                      
                                                                                             
              Connections represent one of the key challenges in advancing the               
              technology for structural systems.  The purpose of the planned                 
              workshop is, therefore, to identify those opportunities and                    
              challenges in the connection area which will make a difference in              
              the 21st century and which require a carefully planned and                     
              nationally coordinated approach for realization or a solution.                 
              The workshop will include a review of today's connection technology            
              and discuss the emerging and required technologies for steel,                  
              concrete and mixed connections.  A combination of plenary sessions             
              and breakout sessions will be conducted.  A few selected keynote               
              presentations will be made to set the stage for the breakout                   
              sessions.
