Abstract    :
              With this grant from the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor                   
              Thomas H. Morton of the University of California, Riverside,                   
              will examine the gas phase chemistry of organic cations which                  
              react via ion-dipole complexes.  The neutral products from the                 
              reactions of organic cations generated by 70eV electron impact                 
              will be examined by using an electron bombardment flow reactor.                
              This reactor will provide stereochemical information about                     
              cation rearrangements which will be critical in order to                       
              understand ion molecule reactions.  Gaseous cations generated                  
              by resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization will also be                      
              examined.  Ionizations of specific conformations of molecules                  
              will be studied by slowing down conformational changes through                 
              rapid cooling by supersonic jet expansion.                                     
              %%%                                                                            
              The chemistry of gas phase molecules from which an electron has                
              removed will be examined.  The neutral products from these                     
              reactions will be isolated and identified.  Several molecules                  
              which can exist in more than one rapidly interconverting                       
              geometry will also be examined.  These molecules will be cooled                
              to stop their interconversions and the chemistry of each                       
              geometric form of the molecule will be examined.
