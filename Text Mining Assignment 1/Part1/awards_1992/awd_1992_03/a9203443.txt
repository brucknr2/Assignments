Abstract    :
                   Rathjen intends to work on the following four problems and                
              related issues.  (1) Give an ordinal analysis of Pi-1-2                        
              comprehension.  (2) Develop strong ordinal representation systems              
              on the basis of recursively large ordinals in lieu of their large              
              cardinal analogues.  (3) Determine the proof-theoretic strength of             
              restricted foundations in weak set theories.  (4) Is Feferman's                
              theory T-0 together with least fixed point axioms for monotone                 
              operators conservative over T-0 with respect to arithmetic                     
              sentences?                                                                     
                   Proof theory concerns itself with axiomatic systems and                   
              methods of proof within them, particularly with the relative                   
              strength of different systems.  The system A is said to be properly            
              stronger than the system B if every proposition that has a proof in            
              B also has a proof in A but the converse is not so.  The                       
              investigator is pursuing a number of questions along these lines,              
              varying in technical difficulty and degree of interest to the                  
              experts, but none is really susceptible to a brief discussion in               
              laymen's terms.
