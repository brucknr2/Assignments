Abstract    :
                   Professor Huntley will work on several problems connected with            
              automorphic forms.  In particular, he will study non-holomorphic               
              cusp forms on higher rank reductive groups.  He hopes to prove an              
              analogue of Weyl's law for such groups.  He will also study small              
              eigenvalues and their relation to the Ramanujan conjecture.                    
                   Automorphic forms arose out of non-Euclidean geometry in the              
              middle of the nineteenth century.  Both mathematicians and                     
              physicists have thus long realized that many objects of fundamental            
              importance are non-Euclidean in their basic nature.  This field is             
              principally concerned with questions about the whole numbers, but              
              in its use of geometry and analysis, it retains connection to its              
              historical roots and thus to problems in areas as diverse as gauge             
              theory in theoretical physics and coding theory in information                 
              theory.
