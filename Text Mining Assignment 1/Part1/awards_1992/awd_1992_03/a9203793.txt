Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is an individual award for the Postdoctoral Fellowship in                 
              Plant Biology.  The applicant received his Ph.D. from the                      
              University of Wisconsin in molecular biology studying regulatory               
              gene sequences in Agrobacterium.  He plans to carry out his                    
              postdoctoral fellowship research in the laboratory of Dr. Tom                  
              Guilfoyle at University of Missouri.  His research entitled "A                 
              functional study of the biochemical role of a family of small                  
              auxin-induced proteins" will broaden the applicant's scientific                
              training into the mode of action of plant hormones in particular               
              and plant physiology and biochemistry in general.
