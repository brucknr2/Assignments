Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a two year project to continue                    
              measurements of dust concentration along the Summit ice core using             
              the 90o Laser-Light-Scattering (LLS) instrument developed under the            
              previous grant (DPP-8922042).  As part of this instrument there is             
              a special heater that melts ice in increments along the core and               
              sucks the meltwater at 90o is measured by a photomultiplier tube               
              and the output, which is proportional to the mass of suspended                 
              particulate matter in the meltwater, is recorded by a computer.                
              Preliminary measurements of laser light scattering on unmelted ice             
              using a similar technique have been made and the initial results               
              are promising.  More work on the technique of laser light                      
              scattering on unmelted ice will be pursued in this study.
