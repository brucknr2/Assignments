Abstract    :
                   The primary objectives of the proposal are to study biased                
              sampling models and tests of significance in projection pursuit.               
              For biased sampling models, penalized maximum likelihood                       
              estimators will be sought and their properties analyzed through a              
              combination of simulation and asymptotic analysis.  Techniques                 
              from isotonic estimation are expected to be useful and new                     
              techniques will be developed as well.  Significance tests for                  
              projection pursuit will be studied through simulation and                      
              asymptotic analysis, probably drawing on recent work on the                    
              maxima of Gaussian random fields.  It is conjectured that                      
              coupling methods may yield a proof of the Markov Renewal Theorem.              
                   Observational studies often encounter or utilize purposively              
              unequal probability sampling models (referred to as biased                     
              sampling models).  A long term goal of this research is the                    
              development of methodology for inference when the (unequal                     
              probability) selection mechanism can be modeled.  A second aspect              
              of this research considers projection pursuit, that is, the                    
              search for underlying relationships in large complex data sets                 
              with many cases and with many variables.  In particular, criteria              
              for determining when relationships have been recognized                        
              accurately will be sought.
