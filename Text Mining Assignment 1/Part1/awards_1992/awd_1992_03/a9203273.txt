Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The PI's two main purposes in this proposal are:  (1) to add              
              a Peruvian scientist (Dr. Carlos Calderon) to the Jicamarca Radio              
              Observatory staff, and (2) to continue upgrading the data taking               
              and processing equipment.  The focus in equipment upgrades will be             
              placed on interfacing both new and old receivers with the Harris               
              Night Hawk computer and CSPI array processor.
