Abstract    :
                   Moy will continue his joint work with Barbasch investigating              
              the unitary dual of a reductive p-adic group and will investigate              
              with Hales certain ways to establish what is called a uniform                  
              germ expansion for orbital integrals.  The research in unitarity,              
              with a goal of classifying all unitary representations, will be                
              to investigate certain basic representations called unipotent                  
              representations.  The investigations in uniform germ expansions                
              will be to find a way for determining whether two spaces of                    
              distributions are equal.                                                       
                   The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian                 
              mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in                  
              twentieth century mathematics.  As the mathematical vehicle for                
              exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system, the                            
              representation theory of Lie groups has had a profound impact                  
              upon mathematics itself, particularly in analysis and number                   
              theory, and upon theoretical physics, especially quantum                       
              mechanics and elementary particle physics.
