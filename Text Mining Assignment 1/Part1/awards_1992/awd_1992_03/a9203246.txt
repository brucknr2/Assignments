Abstract    :
                   This research concerns string equations in mathematical                   
              physics and integrable systems.  In particular, the research                   
              concerns the solutions of partial differential equations related to            
              quantum field theory and string theory that may have solutions                 
              representable as special types of Feynman type integrals.  The                 
              project will also concern isopectral manifolds of differential                 
              operators and boundaries.  In particular, what is the behavior of              
              the differential operators and how does one regularize the                     
              differential operators near their blow-up locus.                               
                   This research is in the general area of geometric analysis and            
              mathematical physics and illustrates the exciting interaction                  
              between mathematics and physics, especially in quantum field theory            
              and string theory where there is a circle of ideas involving                   
              integrable systems, module space, algebras, and matrix models.
