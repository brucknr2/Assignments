Abstract    :
              This cooperative project between George Rapp, University of                    
              Minnesota, and Chen Tiemei, Peking University, will analyze                    
              potsherds from the Early Bronze Age site of Jingnanshi in the                  
              middle reaches of the Yangtze River valley. Using neutron                      
              activation, sherds selected by Chinese archaeologists will be                  
              analyzed at the University of Wisconsin reactor facility. This                 
              analysis will provide quantitative information on interaction                  
              spheres of the communities along the river system from the most                
              critical time of development of civilized society in east Asia.                
                                                                                             
              Archaeological science in China is in its formative stages.  This              
              collaboration will contribute to advancing this science through                
              application of new techniques not yet widely used in China.                    
              Through this cooperation, US scientists will also gain access to               
              important archaeological sites, and to future discoveries                      
              anticipated in China.  Results of this research may shed light on              
              the complex interactions and trade relations in a period of early              
              Chinese civilization dating from the mid- to early second                      
              millennium BC.
