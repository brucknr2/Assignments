Abstract    :
                   The principal investigators will work on problems in                      
              stochastic differential equations and stochastic control with                  
              applications to mathematical finance.  This will include a study               
              of the problem of general equilibrium in complete markets and how              
              market characteristics are affected by the preferences of the                  
              individual agents.                                                             
                   Mathematical studies of investment theory are important for               
              strengthening the infrastructure of the economic sciences.  A                  
              reasonable theory of small investor behavior in a continuous time              
              financial market is one example of how mathematics can                         
              successfully contribute to outstanding important economic                      
              problems.
