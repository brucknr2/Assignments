Abstract    :
              A novel coating has been synthesized under a "Small Grants for                 
              Exploratory Research" (SGER) award.  It is a metastable compound,              
              which appears to be carbon nitride and which appears to have                   
              unusual tribological properties.  Theory predicts that is should               
              have hardness greater than that of diamond, the hardest known                  
              materials.  Under the present award a systematic study will be                 
              undertaken to optimize the deposition process for tribological                 
              performance and to fully evaluate the composition, microstructure              
              and friction and wear behavior of this novel coating material.
