Abstract    :
                   Professor Greenberg will work on several problems connected               
              with a generalized Iwasawa theory. He intends to study the Selmer              
              group in certain infinite extensions of the rational numbers and               
              in certain families of p-adic representations.                                 
                   This project falls into the general area of arithmetic                    
              geometry - a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of                    
              mathematics: number theory and geometry.  This combination has                 
              proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems              
              that withstood generations.  Among its many consequences are new               
              error correcting codes.  Such codes are essential for both modern              
              computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
