Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Interfacial phenomena have become a frontier in polymer science,               
              and much excitement is being generated in a wide variety of the                
              areas dealing with molecular organization and self-assembly of                 
              surface-active polymers, forces between surfaces with adsorbed                 
              polymer chains, interface-mediated chain conformations and polymer-            
              segment density profiles at interfaces.                                        
                                                                                             
              This is a project directed at the polymer-chain transport on                   
              monolayers at the interfaces of air/water and oil/water and toward             
              such interfaces.  With the interfacial dynamic techniques of 1)                
              surface-fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, 2) surface                 
              quasielastic light scattering, and 3) electrocapillary-wave                    
              diffraction in conjunction with the interfacial static techniques              
              of neutron reflectivity and spectroscopic ellipsometry, the                    
              investigators will examine (1) polymer lateral diffusion on the                
              interface of air/water (A/W) and oil/water (O/W); (2) polymer                  
              monolayer viscoelasticity at A/W and at air/polymer interface; (3)             
              polymeric interfaces and effect of copolymers as the surfactants;              
              and (4) extend chain diffusion studies to electrophoresis of                   
              polyelectrolytes with the technique of electric-field-modulated                
              Forced Rayleigh Scattering.
