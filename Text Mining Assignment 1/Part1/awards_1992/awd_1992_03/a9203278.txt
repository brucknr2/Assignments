Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will investigate the phenomenon of "bleaching" in a               
              widespread genus of reef dwelling benthic foraminifera from the                
              Florida Keys region with the purpose of examining its potential as             
              a useful environmental indicator of the "bleaching" problem in                 
              general. Recent widespread episodes of "bleaching" of coral reef               
              organisms has raised concern about the environmental quality of                
              coral reef ecosystems and the potentially deteriorating health of              
              these systems. Foraminifera are small and easily collected                     
              organisms and their collection results in minimal environmental                
              impact to the reefs. The goals of the research are: 1. to describe             
              the process of bleaching and recovery in both laboratory and field             
              bleached individuals; 2. to examine if high temperature and ultra-             
              violet radiation , as well as fluorescent light can induce                     
              bleaching; 3. to determine to what degree the foraminifera can                 
              bleach and still recover; 4. to determine if bleaching inhibits the            
              laying down of the forams calcified shell; 5. to develop techniques            
              to rapidly assay for bleaching.
