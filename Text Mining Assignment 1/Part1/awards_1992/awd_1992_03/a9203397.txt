Abstract    :
                   Professor Sheingorn will work on several problems connected               
              with automorphic forms.  In particular, he will study the                      
              consequences of the insight that certain number theoretic objects              
              are equivalent to geometric traits of geodesics on highly                      
              symmetric spaces.                                                              
                   Automorphic forms arose out of non-Euclidean geometry in the              
              middle of the nineteenth century.  Both mathematicians and                     
              physicists have thus long realized that many objects of                        
              fundamental importance are non-Euclidean in their basic nature.                
              This field is principally concerned with questions about the                   
              whole numbers, but in its use of geometry and analysis, it                     
              retains connection to its historical roots and thus to problems                
              in areas as diverse as gauge theory in theoretical physics and                 
              coding theory in information theory.
