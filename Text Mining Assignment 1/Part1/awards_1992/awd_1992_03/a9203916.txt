Abstract    :
                   This research entails a hierarchy of numerical modeling                   
              studies designed to investigate fundamental dynamics of the upper              
              ocean circulation in 3 regimes: the equatorial, coastal and                    
              subtropical oceans.  The primary model to be used in this                      
              research is a nonlinear, 2 1/2-layer dynamic/thermodynamic ocean               
              model which allows exchange of water between the 2 active layers.              
              The study tasks are either continuations, or natural extensions, of            
              work currently being funded by NSF (8817026 and 8912015).  There               
              are two unifying themes for much of the research: (1) understanding            
              the dynamics of a new type of frontal instability, and (2)                     
              exploring the sensitivity of solutions to the parameterization of              
              entrainment and detrainment physics.

                   The study contains research components that are directly                  
              applicable to all oceans, and research components that are more                
              applicable to specific oceans.  The research components directly               
              applicable to all oceans are: (1) the investigation of the                     
              variability associated with equatorial currents, coastal currents              
              and small-scale oceanic fronts, and (2) the study of interactions              
              between the equatorial, coastal and subtropical ocean circulations.            
               The research components more applicable to specific oceans are:               
              (1) the study of the driving mechanisms of various flow patterns in            
              the Indian Ocean, particularly in the Bay of Bengal, along the                 
              coasts of India, and near the equator, (2) the study of the New                
              Guinea Coastal Undercurrent in the Pacific Ocean.
