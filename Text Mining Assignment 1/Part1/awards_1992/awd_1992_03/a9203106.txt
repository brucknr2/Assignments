Abstract    :
              Fundamental questions of programming language semantics will                   
              be examined through the utilization of algebras, categories,                   
              and monads in an effort to provide a systematic and conceptual                 
              approach to their interpretation and solution.  Areas of                       
              investigation include algebraic fixed point semantics,                         
              categorical models with strong closure properties, axiomatic                   
              domain theory, monadic and comonadic computation, partial data                 
              types, invariant objects, and categorical iterators.
