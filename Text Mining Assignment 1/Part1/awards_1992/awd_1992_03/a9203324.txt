Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              An analysis of geophysical data, specifically gravity and                      
              magnetics, from the Manus Microplate (Bismark Sea) will allow a                
              well-constrained identification of the nature of the deformation at            
              the boundaries and an analysis of its distribution and partitioning            
              around the microplate.  3-D magnetization inversions will be used              
              to trace the details of the surficial evolution of the magmatic                
              systems.  These results will be compared with recent microplate and            
              propagating rift models and observations, and with 3-D geophysical             
              and theoretic studies of mid-ocean spreading centers.
