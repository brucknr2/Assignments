Abstract    :
              A general purpose, self-consistent ensemble                                    
              Monte Carlo model will be developed for two-                                   
              dimensional high-field transport & ultrafast                                   
              phenomena in compound semiconductor                                            
              devices.  A "super-particle" with "cloud-in-cell"                              
              charge assignment scheme for either separate                                   
              or combined background electron and photo-                                     
              generated carrier sub-ensembles, which couples                                 
              an efficient Poisson solver to the Monte Carlo                                 
              algorithm using the evolving distribution                                      
              functions in a self-consistent way.  The                                       
              program will employ an adaptive energy scale                                   
              in combination with a scheme to reduce self-                                   
              scattering rate while maintaining resolution of                                
              the energy distribution without a prior                                        
              assumption on the maximum electron energy.                                     
              These feature will enable, for the first time,                                 
              interactive implementation of such complex                                     
              computations on a work-station level platform.
