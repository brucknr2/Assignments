Abstract    :
                   A GPS survey network will investigate the relationship between            
              caldera deformation and deformation of the Taupo Volcanic Zone                 
              (TVZ) of North Island, New Zealand.  GPS stations in these high                
              strain rate areas will be resurveyed in the second year of this                
              experiment.  The high accuracy epoch GPS measurements which are                
              made during the surveys will also be the basis for future                      
              deformation  monitoring.  It is anticipated that future                        
              measurements will be made by Victoria University and the NZGS as               
              GPS programs are developed there.
