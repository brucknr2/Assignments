Abstract    :
              This award addresses the need for less time-consuming simulations              
              of larger biomolecular systems, for example water-membrane systems             
              of more than ten thousand atoms.  The recent availability of                   
              implementations of the three-dimensional fast multipole method                 
              presents an opportunity for the rapid implementation of                        
              enhancements to a molecular dynamics package.  Highly suitable is              
              a computer program of the investigator and his collaborators called            
              MD, which interfaces to the data files and processing routines of              
              a popular macromolecular modeling package.  The program MD has been            
              used to test computational methods, to advance science, and to                 
              benchmark computer systems.  The PI will incorporate code into MD              
              that implements the fast multipole method, will parallelize this               
              code, and will combine it with distance class techniques and simple            
              higher order time-integrated schemes.
