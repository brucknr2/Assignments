Abstract    :
              This research is focused on several existing models of the                     
              dynamics of colliding rigid bodies. Although recent work has                   
              revealed energy inconsistencies in the classical Newton-Whittaker              
              method, there is insufficient experimental supporting evidence of              
              the behaviors implicit in the model structures. To test some of                
              the more recent approaches a series of laboratory experiments                  
              involving load cells, kinematic chains and a high-speed camera                 
              processor will be carried out. The data set will include normal                
              force at collision point, coefficients of friction, coefficient                
              of restitution as well as pre and post-impact velocities.                      
              Analysis of the experimental results and the several existing                  
              models will serve to advance our understanding of two and three                
              dimensional impact dynamics.*** //
