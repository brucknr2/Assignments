Abstract    :
              Dr. Craig A. Coburn has been awarded a Postdoctoral Fellowship                 
              in Chemistry. Dr. Coburn's doctoral degree was from Brown                      
              University with Professor Kathlyn Parker. Dr. Coburn intends to                
              continue his research with Professor Samuel Danishefsky at the                 
              Sloan-Kettering Institute. In his postdoctoral work, Dr. Coburn                
              will learn the techniques of the synthesis of complex                          
              biologically active molecules. This will complement his                        
              graduate work developing methods towards the synthesis of                      
              Gilvocarcin and help to prepare him for his career goal of                     
              synthesizing difficult natural products such as taxol and its                  
              analogs.                                                                       
              %%%                                                                            
              The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as                 
              an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the                   
              knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.'s and attract them into                  
              meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and                       
              teaching.
