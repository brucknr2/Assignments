Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  A lidar system developed at the University of Maryland is                 
              being restored to operation at Utah State University, as part of               
              the Bear Lake Observatory (BLO) facilities - a mid-latitude CEDAR              
              observatory.  Lidar observations will be made initially in the                 
              altitude range 30-70 km, as done previously at College Park,                   
              covering the upper stratosphere and lower mesosphere.  The altitude            
              coverage will be extended with the addition of a more powerful                 
              laser by Clemson University upward to 80 km.  At higher altitudes,             
              near the mesopause, these lidar observations will be complemented              
              by the passive optical instruments at BLO.  Vertical profiles of               
              molecular density and temperature will be derived from clear-air               
              portions of the atmosphere above 30 km, using Rayleigh scattering              
              at 532 nm.  The downward extension of these profiles into regions              
              were Mie (particulate) scattering significantly adds to the lidar              
              return will employ Raman scattering from atmospheric molecules.                
              These profiles will be used to examine the occurrence, structure,              
              interaction, and variability of planetary waves, tides, and gravity            
              waves in the middle atmosphere above an extended mountainous                   
              region.  This award provides funds for the PI to help make the                 
              system operational at BLO, and begin measurements.
