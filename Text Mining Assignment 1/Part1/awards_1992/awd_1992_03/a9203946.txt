Abstract    :
                   Humans employ diagrams and other pictures, both real and                  
              imagined, as aids to reasoning, and many kinds of problems are                 
              solved by an interaction between propositional reasoning and                   
              spatial imagery.  This research will explore computational                     
              explanations of this ability.  The use of diagrams is in part a                
              form of spatial reasoning, which is the use of representations of              
              objects in space for problem-solving, inferring, and learning.                 
              Spatial reasoning is an important ability of humans, and machines              
              with similar capacities will have certain advantages over machines             
              without them, including a more natural mode of interaction with                
              people.  The proposed research hypothesizes that these are forms of            
              representation that aid human reasoning by providing                           
              psychologically and computationally efficient ways of capturing and            
              propagating the constraints of real world events and mathematical              
              abstractions.  The creation, modification and transformation of                
              these representations allow a person to perform mental experiments             
              that make deductions and test conjectures about the corresponding              
              physical situations and mathematical relations.  The ultimate                  
              result of this research could be a better scientific understanding             
              of the psychology of reasoning with imagery, and the basis of a                
              technology for machines that can think directly in images.//
