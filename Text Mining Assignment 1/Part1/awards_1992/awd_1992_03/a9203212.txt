Abstract    :
                   This grant covers experimental Elementary Particle                        
              Physics Research by a large group at the University of                         
              Washington in collaboration with other NSF and DOE supported                   
              scientists.  The group will continue studying the detailed                     
              predictions of the Standard Model of Quarks and Leptons.  They                 
              have a broad program studying the production and decays of the                 
              charmed quark, the heaviest lepton, the tau lepton, and the                    
              heaviest boson, the Z0 neutral boson.  They also collaborate                   
              on studies of very high energy cosmic rays.
