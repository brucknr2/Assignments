Abstract    :
              Dr. Sonny Lee has been awarded a Postdoctoral Fellowship in                    
              Chemistry. Dr. Lee's doctoral degree was from Harvard under the                
              supervision of Professor Richard Holm. Dr. Lee intends to                      
              continue research at the California Institute of Technology                    
              with Professor Harry Gray where he intends to study                            
              photoinitiated electron transfer. This will also expose him to                 
              techniques of molecular biology such as site directed                          
              mutagenesis, and protein purification and handling. This                       
              experience will prepare him for his long term goals of studying                
              the coupling of electron transfer to chemically active sites in                
              biological systems.                                                            
              %%%                                                                            
              The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as                 
              an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the                   
              knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.'s and attract them into                  
              meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and                       
              teaching.
