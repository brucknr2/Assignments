Abstract    :
                   Professor Keating will work on the Igusa tower that arise in              
              the theory of modular curves, the action of the automorphism                   
              group of certain formal groups defined on the moduli space of                  
              deformations and finally to characterize the fields arising from               
              formal groups obtained by deformations.                                        
                   This project falls into the general area of arithmetic                    
              geometry - a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of                    
              mathematics: number theory and geometry.  This combination has                 
              proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems              
              that withstood generations.  Among its many consequences are new               
              error correcting codes.  Such codes are essential for both modern              
              computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
