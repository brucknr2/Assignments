Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will study the mineralogical transition             
              from smectite to chlorite. Goals of the project are to determine               
              if random ordering is metastable with respect to regular ordering,             
              and also to establish which techniques provide the best                        
              characterization of discrete and mixed-layer phases. By studying               
              an active geothermal system in Iceland the PI hopes to determine               
              the relationship between clay mineral paragenesis and metamorphic              
              grade.
