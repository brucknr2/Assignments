Abstract    :
                   Professor Palathingal will undertake the investigation of                 
              single quantum annihilation of positrons, using the Dynamitron                 
              facility of the Brookhaven National Laboratory.  Differential                  
              cross sections will be measured with enhanced precision for the                
              core electron shells, employing thin targets of varied atomic                  
              number.
