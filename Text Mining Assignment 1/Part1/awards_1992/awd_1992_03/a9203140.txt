Abstract    :
              From a general point of view, the proposed work will involve the               
              development, implementation and evaluation of a general object-                
              oriented framework for use in nonlinear dynamic structural finite              
              element analysis.  This framework will consist of sets of classes              
              of objects modeling nodes, elements, degrees-of-freedom,                       
              materials and so on.  In light of the special issues surrounding               
              nonlinear dynamic analysis, the classes will be designed with the              
              following goals in mind:  to allow flexibility in algorithm                    
              selection, implementation, and distribution; to be well-suited                 
              for parallel implementation; and to function well in an                        
              interactive environment with respect to model development,                     
              modification and visualization.  To achieve these goals, several               
              key components will be used: coordinate-free geometry, iterative               
              techniques for solving systems of equations; and an element-by-                
              element implementation strategy.//
