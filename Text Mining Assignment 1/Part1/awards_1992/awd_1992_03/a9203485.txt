Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  In 1989 a long lasting earthquake swarm was detected near 60              
              degrees north on the Reykjanes ridge.  The area of the swarm has               
              been mapped and imaged by SeaMARC II and Hydrosweep in 1990, and               
              suggests the presence of two apparent young lava flows.  During the            
              summer of 1992 the Russian research vessel Keldysh with its two                
              deep-diving MIR submersibles will investigate, verify, and sample              
              these two flows.  The award is to provide support for the principal            
              investigator to participate in the cruise.
