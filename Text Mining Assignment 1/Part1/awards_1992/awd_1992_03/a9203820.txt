Abstract    :
              Stable isotope and chemical analyses of fluid inclusions provide               
              important geochemical constraints on the formation conditions of               
              minerals in a variety of geological environments.  Hydrogen and                
              oxygen isotope measurements have been made of inclusions in                    
              optically transparent hydrothermal ore and gangue minerals like                
              quartz, adularia, fluorite, and sphalerite.  No one, however, has              
              reported stable isotope analyses of fluid inclusions in native                 
              metals.  There are a few published papers and abstracts (all in                
              Russian) that address inclusions in native metals.  In one abstract            
              Petrovskaya et al. (1974) report that 0.1-1.5 mm inclusions,                   
              containing CO2 as a major constituent, are common in some native               
              gold.  Beyond such simple but important observations, however, the             
              literature is to all intents and purposes devoid of information on             
              the subject.  Native metals, while not of widespread occurrence,               
              should be among the best mineral repositories for environmental                
              fluids.                                                                        
              Stable isotope analyses of inclusions trapped in gold will provide             
              valuable insights into (1) the environmental conditions of native              
              gold formation and related processes of ore deposition, (2)                    
              possible geochemical differences between inclusion fluids trapped              
              in different cogenetic hosts, (3) past continental climates, and               
              (4) variation of the oxygen isotope composition of ocean water                 
              through geologic time.
