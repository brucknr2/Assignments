Abstract    :
              This an individual award for the Postdoctoral Fellowship in Plant              
              Biology.  The applicant received her Ph.D. from the University of              
              Illinois and her Ph.D. research was in regulation of photosynthetic            
              metabolism in barely.  She plans to carry out her postdoctoral                 
              fellowship research in the laboratory of Dr. June Nasrallah at                 
              Cornell University.  The proposed research entitled "Analysis of               
              the role of protein phosphorylation in the self-incompatibility                
              response of Brassica" will broaden the training of the Fellow into             
              plan molecular genetics and developmental biology.
