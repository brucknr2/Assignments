Abstract    :
                   Essential laminations are a recently defined generalization of            
              both the incompressible surface and the codimension-one foliation              
              without Reeb components of a compact 3-manifold.  Both of these                
              more classical objects have proved remarkably useful in obtaining              
              geometric/topological information about 3-manifolds from                       
              homotopy-theoretic data, and the essential lamination has already              
              begun to show itself to be a worthy successor to both of its                   
              `parents.'  The investigator intends to use essential laminations              
              to study the extent to which the fundamental group of a 3-manifold             
              determines the manifold up to homeomorphism, and also to study the             
              question of whether or not the manifold admits a hyperbolic                    
              structure.  He further intends to use the existence of normal forms            
              for essential laminations to study the question of whether or not              
              a 3-manifold (principally a hyperbolic 3-manifold) contains an                 
              essential lamination.                                                          
                   It is a surprising fact that although we live in a three                  
              dimensional space, a so-called 3-manifold, and so are blessed with             
              a natural intuition about such geometric objects, in the end this              
              does not carry us as far as we might have expected, for questions              
              which have been settled by algebraic calculations for higher                   
              dimensional manifolds still remain baffling in the 3-dimensional               
              case.  The most famous of these is the celebrated conjecture of                
              Poincare from around the turn of the century concerning 3-                     
              dimensional spheres, where precisely the original 3-dimensional                
              case is the only one still open.  The investigator is pursuing a               
              variety of questions about 3-dimensional manifolds, some with                  
              slightly strange notions of distance on them, so-called hyperbolic             
              metrics, but time and time again these questions have been shown to            
              have clear relevance to the case of manifolds with a more familiar             
              notion of distance.
