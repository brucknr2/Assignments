Abstract    :
              Successful colonization of plant tissue by Pseudomonas syringae                
              appears to require the ability to cope with oxidative stree caused             
              by the HOOH produced during early phases of the interaction.  P.               
              syringae strains were found to contain 10 to 100-fold higher levels            
              of catalase activity than their nonpathogenic relatives, P.                    
              fluorescens and P. putida.  At least 8 catalase isozymes were                  
              detected in lysates of P. syringae pv. glycinea race 4.  Two of                
              these isozymes were unique to the periplasm.  Catalase activity in             
              P. syringae strains was dependent on the growth phase of the                   
              culture.  The specific activity of cytoplasmic catalases increased             
              during the transition to stationary phase.  These results are                  
              consistent with the involvement of multiple catalase isozymes in               
              the reduction of oxidative stress during pathogenesis by these                 
              bacteria.
