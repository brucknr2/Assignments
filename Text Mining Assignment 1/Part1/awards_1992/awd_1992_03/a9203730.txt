Abstract    :
              Since, in contrast to other methods, interval computations give results        
              with mathematical certainty, even in the presence of uncertainty in the        
              data, roundoff error, and nonlinearities, they are of unique potential         
              importance throughout science, engineering, and operations research.           
              The work in this project will advance realization of this potential in         
              the following ways.                                                            
                                                                                             
                   o  A modern, portable, standardized library of elementary functions       
                      will be developed, compatible with the operator overloading            
                      feature of Fortran 90, to be used in conjunction with interval         
                      arithmetic computations.                                               
                                                                                             
                   o  A parsing technique for nonlinear systems of algebraic equations       
                      will be implemented to better take advantage of the structure of       
                      such systems, and thus avoid much of the overestimation and            
                      resulting inefficiency in interval nonlinear system solvers.           
                                                                                             
                   o  The methods will be applied to various practical problems,             
                      including robust geometric computation, robot kinematics,              
                      chemical kinetics equilibrium, and chemical refinery models.
