Abstract    :
              This is an individual award for the Postdoctoral Research                      
              Fellowship in Plant Biology.  The applicant received his Ph.D. from            
              Stanford University.  His Ph.D. research was in the area of plant              
              genetics, with emphasis on genome evolution.  He plans to carry out            
              his postdoctoral fellowship research in the laboratory of Dr. Axel             
              Brennicke at Institute fur Genbiologische Forschung Berlin GmbH, in            
              Berlin, Germany.  The proposed research entitled "Biochemistry of              
              replication in mitochondria of Arabidopsis thaliana" will broaden              
              the training of the Fellow into nucleic acid biochemistry and will             
              introduce him to a new model plant system.
