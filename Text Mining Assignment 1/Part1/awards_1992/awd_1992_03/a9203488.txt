Abstract    :
                This project concerns the design and study of computational methods          
              for the solution of nonlinear systems of equations involving multi-            
              dimensional parameter vectors.  Such systems arise frequently in               
              equilibrium problems in science and engineering where, generally,              
              interest centers on the computational assessment of the change of the          
              solutions under variation of the parameters.  The work utilizes that           
              under conditions, which typically hold in practice, the set of all             
              solutions forms a differentiable manifold in the combined state and            
              parameter space.  It has been shown previously that a consistent use           
              of differential geometric concepts and techniques provides a new and           
              powerful tool for the development of the desired computational methods         
              for analyzing the shape and properties of the solution manifold.  This         
              project will investigate the further development of a manifold-                
              approximation algorithms, of the resulting computational errors and of         
              sensitivity measures for the computed solutions, of the reduced basis          
              method and its errors in the multi-parameter case, and of methods for          
              solving ordinary and certain partial differential equations on                 
              implicitly defined manifolds.
