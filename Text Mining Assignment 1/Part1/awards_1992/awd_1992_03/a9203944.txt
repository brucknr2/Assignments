Abstract    :
                   The region encompassing the Qinghai-Xizang (Tibetan) Plateau              
              is of special importance in the study of global climatic                       
              variation because, as the largest and highest plateau in the                   
              world,  Qinghai-Xizang strongly influences such large-scale                    
              climatic phenomena as the Asian monsoon.  Our understanding of                 
              the climate of this area is severely constrained by lack of                    
              meteorological data predating 1950.  This award supports a                     
              project designed to increase our understanding of the nature and               
              causes of climatic variation in western China over the past                    
              thousand years.  Tree-ring data from western china will be used                
              to reconstruct temperature and precipitation variation.  A                     
              significant component of the research effort will be the                       
              development of methods to measure climatically sensitive xylem                 
              characteristics (e.g., density, cell structure) using image-                   
              analysis techniques.  The validity of the reconstructions will be              
              assessed through comparisons with other proxy climatic data                    
              (e.g., historical records, isotopic variations in glacial ice).                
              The reconstruction will be used to address (1) the nature of                   
              long-term temperature trends, (2) the temporal and spatial                     
              patterns of drought, and (3) the relationship between trends in                
              temperature on the Tibetan Plateau and Asian monsoon.
