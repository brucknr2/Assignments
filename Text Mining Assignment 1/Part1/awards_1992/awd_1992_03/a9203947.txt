Abstract    :
              Instrument Cluster Studies of the Mesosphere and Lower                         
              Thermosphedr at Arecibo                                                        
              This award supports a three year program of continued                          
              comprehensive studies of mesosphere and lower thermosphere                     
              aeronomy.  This program builds on the techniques and results of                
              the 1989 AIDA (Arecibo Initiative in Dynamics of the Atmosphere)               
              campaign and will utilize the radar and optical facilities of                  
              Arecibo Observatory as well as sodium and iron lidars from Penn                
              State and/or the University of Illinois.  Of particular interest               
              are the apparently linked dynamical and chemical processes                     
              leading to the formation of ion, neutral sodium, and neutral iron              
              layers in the 80-110 km height range.  Additional interest                     
              centers on the origin of the 6-hour tide, the relationship of                  
              this tide with sporadic intermediate ionization layers, on the                 
              occasional unexplained occurrence of ion layers as low as 82 km                
              altitude, and on convective processes as observed in the sodium                
              layer.  This research program will culminate in the proposed 1994              
              AIDA-LAMS (LAyers and MicroStructure) campaign which will utilize              
              several radars and lidars as well as other instruments to                      
              investigate these and other phenomena.  Several graduate and                   
              undergraduate students will be part of this research effort which              
              also involves research residencies at the Observatory.
