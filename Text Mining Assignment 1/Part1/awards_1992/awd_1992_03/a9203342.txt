Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A large and diverse number of marine organisms accumulate a                    
              remarkable diversity of toxic halogenated organic compounds.                   
              However, neither the ecological roles nor biosynthetic controls of             
              these compounds are well understood and this is especially true for            
              organisms other than molluscs and sponges (poriferan taxa).  This              
              project involves a synoptic study of the benthic enteropneust,                 
              Saccoglossus kowalevskyi, which will establish some of the key                 
              environmental and genetic factors which regulate patterns of                   
              haloorganic accumulation in these organisms, and provide new                   
              insights on the effects of toxic haloorganics on microorganisms and            
              biogeochemical processes in marine sediments.  Saccoglossus                    
              kowalevskyi is ideally suited for this work since: 1) it is a                  
              common component of the intertidal macrofauna; 2) many aspects of              
              its biology (e.g., feeding, digestion, reproduction, excretion) are            
              well characterized; 3) it has a significant impact on freshly-                 
              deposited organic matter in the intertidal zone.  In addition, this            
              research will help establish a model for secondary product                     
              accumulation that differs from currently accepted models based on              
              studies of molluscs and sponges.
