Abstract    :
                   The main goal of this project is to develop methods from                  
              topology and apply them to representation theory of groups and                 
              automorphic forms.  The first part is a program to study perverse              
              sheaves from the micro-local point of view.  This includes an                  
              extension of the category of perverse sheaves to arbitrary                     
              homogeneous symplectic manifolds as well as the study of the mixed             
              and irregular versions of the theory.  The second part attempts                
              applications to representation theory, in particular, geometric                
              constructions of representations and micro-local study of                      
              characters of representations.  The third part is work on the                  
              geometric Langlands conjecture from various points of view.                    
                   Groups are the natural algebraic structures to describe                   
              symmetry.  It is a classical method of understanding a group to                
              realize (or represent) it as a collection of transformations of a              
              vector space.  The theory of representations has become highly                 
              evolved and even made itself indispensable in the study of quantum             
              mechanics, but it is by no means a completed theory and a closed               
              book.  The investigator is bringing to bear some of the latest                 
              topological and geometric methods in answering outstanding                     
              questions of representation theory.  Connections with other topics             
              in algebra and analysis are to be expected.
