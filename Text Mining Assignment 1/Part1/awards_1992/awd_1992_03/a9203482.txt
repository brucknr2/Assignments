Abstract    :
                   This awards supports the research of Professor A. Nemethi to              
              work in algebraic geometry.  He will work on invariants of                     
              singularities and global polynomials.  He plans to study the                   
              behavior of the signature for composed singularities.  He hopes                
              to see the connections between the signature of surface                        
              singularities and the Casson invariant of links.                               
                   The research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one of                
              the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which blossomed                
              to the point where it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems               
              that have stood for centuries.  Originally, it treated figures                 
              defined in the plane by the simplest of equations, namely                      
              polynomials.  Today, the field uses methods not only from                      
              algebra, but also from analysis and topology, and conversely it                
              is extensively used in those fields.  Moreover, it has proved                  
              itself useful in fields as diverse as physics, theoretical                     
              computer science, cryptography, coding theory and robotics.
