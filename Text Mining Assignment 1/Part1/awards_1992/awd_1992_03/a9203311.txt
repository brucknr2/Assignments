Abstract    :
              Dr. Thomas J. Meyer of the Chemistry Department, University of                 
              North Carolina at Chapel Hill, will continue to study the                      
              detailed mechanisms for oxidation of organic substrates by high                
              oxidation state ruthenium and osmium polypyridyl complexes.                    
              This work will be supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and                
              Organometallic Chemistry Program.  Of particular interest are                  
              reactions of di-oxo complexes which can accomplish the transfer                
              of four electrons.  New compounds will be synthesized in which                 
              the metal-oxo sites are linked by briding groups, thus giving                  
              spatial control to the reaction.  In addition, the chemistry of                
              the analogous imido complexes will be investigated.  Special                   
              attention will be paid to aqua to oxo conversions, so that the                 
              nature of the hydrogen transfer step, perhaps as hydride or a                  
              proton, can be elucidated.

              This fundamental research is relevant to understanding the                     
              behavior of selective catalysts for organic reactions and the                  
              development of effective industrial catalysts which utilize                    
              atmospheric oxygen.  Olefins, aromatic hydrocarbons, amines,                   
              and other classes of compounds might be oxidized by the                        
              catalysts developed.
