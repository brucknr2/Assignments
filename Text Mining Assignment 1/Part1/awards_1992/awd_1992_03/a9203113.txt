Abstract    :
                   This research will test three specific hypotheses that may                
              account for the maintenance of non-functional anther and pollen                
              production in functionally female plants of Thalictrum polygamum,              
              a native perennial plant with a cryptically dioecious breeding                 
              system.  Anther and pollen production may remain in females as a               
              reward for insect pollinators because of selection pressure for                
              increased insect visitation (Adaptation Hypothesis); as a                      
              correlated response because of selection maintaining anther and                
              pollen production in males (i.e. a strong, positive genetic                    
              correlation exists between anther and pollen production in males               
              and females, Genetic Constraint Hypothesis); or as vestiges of                 
              the ancestral cosexual state because there is little or no                     
              selective benefit to their removal (i.e. no "cost" to females for              
              production of anthers and pollen, Ancestry Hypothesis).                        
                   The second portion of this project will evaluate the                      
              evolutionary pathway by which dioecy has evolved in the T.                     
              polygamun, the possible role of resource reallocation as a                     
              selective force important to this transition, and the relevance                
              of wind pollination to the change.
