Abstract    :
                   The investigators will use mathematical analysis and                      
              computation to investigate neural processing in the auditory                   
              brainstem and midbrain.  The project has four main topics: (1)                 
              Mathematical development of a model for azimuthal localization in              
              the lateral superior olive based on intensity differences; (2)                 
              Development and analysis of computational models for azimuthal                 
              localization by the medial superior olive and avian analogues                  
              based  on phase differences; (3) Models for the neural processing              
              of echoes in the lateral lemniscus of the bat and                              
              mathematical questions of signal reconstruction; (4) General                   
              principles of neural processing.                                               
                   The purpose of this project is to understand the basic                    
              organizational principles of parts of the brain that                           
              analyze sounds.  These parts are made up of small signaling                    
              devices called neurons, which are organized and connected so that              
              they perform specific functions (for example, to determine the                 
              location of a sound based on the fact that the sound will be                   
              louder at the ear more closely directed toward the sound source).              
              Progress in understanding these principles of organization may                 
              make possible the design of artificial hearing devices that could              
              be used in industrial robots or could be used to improve the                   
              hearing of humans with serious hearing deficiencies.
