Abstract    :
                   Professor Kottwitz will work on several problems connected                
              with automorphic forms.  In particular, he will study endoscopy                
              and its applications to Shimura varieties.  He will also work on               
              the stable version of Arthur's trace formula, problems of bad                  
              reduction of Shimura varieties and connections between the stable              
              trace formula and the Lefschetz fixed point formula.                           
                   Automorphic forms arose out of Non-Euclidean geometry in the              
              middle of the nineteenth century.  Both mathematicians and                     
              physicists have thus long realized that many objects of                        
              fundamental importance are non-Euclidean in their basic nature.                
              This field is principally concerned with questions about the                   
              whole numbers, but in its use of geometry and analysis, it                     
              retains connection to its historical roots and thus to problems                
              in areas as diverse as gauge theory in theoretical physics and                 
              coding theory in information theory.
