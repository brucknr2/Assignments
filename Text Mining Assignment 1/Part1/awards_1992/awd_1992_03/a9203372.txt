Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This proposal requests support to study the composition and               
              dynamics of intermediate layers.  The PIs will measure these layers            
              using incoherent scatter radar, optical techniques, and HF Radar               
              sounders.  Two opposing models of intermediate layers will be                  
              evaluated to determine their composition.  Secondly, the PIs will              
              focus on the tidal control of the low-altitude limit of the layer.             
              The study's aim is to increase capability in modeling the valley               
              region between E and F regions in the ionosphere through a greater             
              understanding of ionization sources and tidal control of the                   
              descending plasma layers.
