Abstract    :
                   This project will support the study of effective and robust               
              strategies for the solution of large linear systems that arise                 
              from the discretization of elliptic boundary value problems.                   
              Major emphasis will be on the solution of non-self-adjoint,                    
              indefinite problems, e.g., the exterior Helmholtz problem.  Both               
              preconditioning strategies and computational strategies on                     
              parallel machines will be investigated.  In the area of                        
              preconditioning strategies, the objective will be the derivation               
              of estimates of condition numbers as well as the distribution of               
              eigenvalues and singular values of the preconditioned systems.                 
              The preconditioning of pseudospectral discretizations by finite                
              difference or finite element discretizations will also be                      
              studied.  In the area of computational strategies, the                         
              effectiveness and implementation of various preconditioning                    
              strategies on SIMD and MIMD computer systems will be studied.                  
                   In solving boundary value problems for elliptic equations                 
              numerically, it becomes necessary to solve the very large systems              
              of linear equations that arise when the continuous problem is                  
              replaced with a discrete problem.  The principal investigator                  
              will develop numerical methods that are both efficient and robust              
              for solving such systems.
