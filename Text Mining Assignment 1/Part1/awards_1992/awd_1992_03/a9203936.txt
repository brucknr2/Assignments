Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The study will reconstruct the high resolution record of eolian                
              deposition in the Arabian sea and the Gulf of Aden using deep                  
              drilling cores.  The objective is to understand terrestrial                    
              climatic evolution in this area over the past 7 million years.                 
              Magnetic susceptibility will be measured to obtain the eolian                  
              variability record.  General circulation model experiments will                
              also be employed to investigate linkages between high and low                  
              latitude climatic regimes.
