Abstract    :
              This is an individual award for the Postdoctoral Fellowship in                 
              Plant Biology.  The applicant received his Ph.D. from the                      
              University of California at Berkeley in molecular genetics in                  
              maize.  He plans to carry out his postdoctoral fellowship in the               
              laboratory of Dr. Donald McCarty at University of Florida.  His                
              research entitled "Genetics and molecular biology of embryogenesis             
              and seed maturation in maize" will broaden the applicant's                     
              scientific training into plant development.
