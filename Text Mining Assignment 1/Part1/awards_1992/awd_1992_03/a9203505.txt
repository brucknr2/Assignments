Abstract    :
                   Feres will study several problems in differential geometry                
              and dynamical systems whose aim is to understand certain                       
              phenomena of rigidity of group actions.  The solution to these                 
              problems could shed some light on a general conjecture of                      
              Zimmer's concerning actions of higher rank lattice groups and                  
              improve certain aspects of Gromov's theory of rigid                            
              transformation groups in the special case when such groups                     
              possess elements that define dynamical systems with hyperbolic                 
              behavior.                                                                      
                   This project involves research in ergodic theory.  Ergodic                
              theory in general concerns understanding the average behavior of               
              systems whose dynamics is too complicated or chaotic to be                     
              followed in microscopic detail.  Under the heading "dynamics                   
              can be placed the modern theory of how groups of abstract                      
              transformations act on smooth spaces.  In this way ergodic theory              
              makes contact with geometry in its quest to classify flows on                  
              homogeneous spaces.
