Abstract    :
              1his project, in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic                
              Chemistry Program, will involve the synthesis and                              
              characterization of new iron thiolate complexes that                           
              incorporate N-H to S hydrogen bonds, which are designed to                     
              serve as models for iron-sulfur proteins.  The objective of the                
              study is to determine the effect of such hydrogen bonds on the                 
              redox potential of the iron thiolate complexes.  The results                   
              are expected to provide significant insight into the way in                    
              which the redox potentials are controlled in the biological                    
              molecules.  Characterization of the thiolate complexes will                    
              involve electrochemistry (cyclic voltammetry), infrared and                    
              Raman scattering spectroscopies, and x-ray crystallography.

              Proteins that contain iron-sulfur clusters are involved in a                   
              variety of electron transfer processes that occur in biological                
              systems.  The precise driving force (redox potential) for these                
              clusters varies in subtle ways that are not yet understood.  It                
              has been hypothesized that hydrogen bonding to other portions                  
              of the protein is responsible for "tuning" of the redox                        
              potential.  The objective of this research is to design and                    
              synthesize models for the iron-sulfur clusters that will allow                 
              for a systematic test of this hypothesis.
