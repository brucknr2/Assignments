Abstract    :
                   This award provides support for the operation and maintenance             
              of the NSF-University of Arizona Accelerator Mass Spectrometry                 
              (AMS) Facility. The AMS Facility at Arizona operates a tandem                  
              accelerator and associated sample preparation facilities on behalf             
              of a wide-ranging national community of researchers who depend on              
              it for analysis of rare cosmogenic isotopes (mainly radiocarbon or             
              14C) used for dating of natural samples and artifacts. The AMS                 
              technique enables uniquely sensitive analysis for radioactive 14C              
              in extremely small samples or where the concentration is extremely             
              low. Recent projects at the NSF-University of Arizona AMS Facility             
              have included analysis of polar ice and lake sediment cores for                
              paleoclimate records, definitive dating of the Shroud of Turin,                
              dating of specific organic molecular components in fossil samples,             
              determining exposure ages of meteorites and terrestrial erosion                
              surfaces, dating of early American maize remains, dating of fossil             
              human skeletal remains, general archeological dating, dating                   
              prehistoric art, as well as numerous projects in earth sciences,               
              hydrology, atmospheric sciences, and agronomy.
