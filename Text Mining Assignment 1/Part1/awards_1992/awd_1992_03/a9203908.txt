Abstract    :
              The authors are proposing to organize a workshop in                            
              April or May of 1992 on modeling and identification of                         
              uncertainty for the purpose of robust control design.  It                      
              is anticipated that such a workshop will foster                                
              collaborations and accelerate the development of this                          
              research area.  The workshop will also consider more                           
              broadly the question of the connections between                                
              analysis, simulation, and experiments in control design,                       
              as well as the problem of developing meaningful                                
              benchmark applications to aid researchers in evaluating                        
              and comparing different methodologies.
