Abstract    :
              In the last decade the nonlinear                                               
              optical properties of                                                          
              semiconductors, especially GaAs and                                            
              A1GaAs have been studied                                                       
              extensively near their bandgap, and                                            
              have been applied with limited                                                 
              success to all-optical switching.                                              
              However little is known about the                                              
              physics and applications of                                                    
              semiconductors near half their gap.                                            
              Our preliminary results on a

              shown the potential for classical                                              
              all-optical waveguide switching                                                
              below half the band gap.  Based on                                             
              this preliminary result, it is
