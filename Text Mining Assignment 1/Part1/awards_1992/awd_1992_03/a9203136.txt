Abstract    :
                   Pfeffer will extend the classical Kirillov theory of real                 
              nilpotent Lie groups to the non-type-I setting.  The basic                     
              technique involved exploits the structure of co-adjoint orbits                 
              closures in the dual of the associated Lie algebra.  These                     
              closures are cosets of subgoups of the Lie algebra dual which                  
              annihilate ideals in the Lie algebra.  Pfeffer will investigate                
              whether the space of co-adjoint orbit closures is homeomorphic to              
              the primitive ideal space.                                                     
                   The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian                 
              mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in                  
              twentieth century mathematics.  As the mathematical vehicle for                
              exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system, the                            
              representation theory of Lie groups has had a profound impact                  
              upon mathematics itself, particularly in analysis and number                   
              theory, and upon theoretical physics, especially quantum                       
              mechanics and elementary particle physics.
