Abstract    :
                   Design is the key technology for industries that wish to                  
              increase their competitive advantage in the international                      
              marketplace.  This advantage comes from the ability to identify                
              customer demands and quickly translate these into new products.                
              The application of methodologies which can shorten the lead-time               
              in product development and be applied as a general tool for design             
              in many fields will be essential for the future competitiveness of             
              the United States industry.  The purpose of the workshop is to                 
              explore how the axiomatic approach to design can be applied to                 
              satisfy the industrial needs and be further developed to provide               
              the fundamental basis for design.                                              
                    The workshop will examine the design needs and problem in the            
              areas of product and process design, software design and                       
              organizational design.  The needs of the industry will be examined             
              in terms of fundamental design methodologies.  The constraints and             
              requirements imposed by industrial practice to the automotive,                 
              construction, material, electronic and software industries will be             
              discussed.***//
