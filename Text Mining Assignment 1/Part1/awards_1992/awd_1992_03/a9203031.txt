Abstract    :
                   The objective of this research is to study fine root                      
              dynamics along a floodplain forest chronosequence sere on the                  
              Bonanza Creek LTER near Fairbanks, Alaska.  The aboveground                    
              structure and function of these and other taiga forests are well               
              documented, but little is known about below ground processes.                  
              Direct observations of roots, made with minirhizotrons, will be                
              used to study the life history and longevity of fine roots and                 
              mycorrhizae.  These data will be used to estimate the rate at                  
              which the fine root system is turning over and being replaced                  
              each year.  Fine root/mycorrhizae production and motality rates                
              determined via direct observation will be combined with biomass                
              and nutrient content data derived from destructive harvest of the              
              root systems to determine patterns of carbon allocation to fine                
              roots and mycorrhizae during succession.  The research is                      
              designed to capitalize on the strengths of direct and indirect                 
              methods of studying root systems to better understand the role of              
              roots and mycorrhizae in ecosystem processes in the Alaskan                    
              taiga.
