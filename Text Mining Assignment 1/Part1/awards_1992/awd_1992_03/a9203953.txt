Abstract    :
              Measurements of DOC and DON by the high temperature catalytic                  
              oxidation method will be made on samples from upper ocean                      
              hydrocasts along four N-S transects across the Equatorial Pacific              
              in both the spring and the fall of 1992.  The sampling grid was                
              designed and the timing of the cruises was selected in order to                
              observe the complete range of seasonal variability.  These survey-             
              type measurements will provide critically needed data for                      
              constraining upper ocean models of the carbon and nitrogen cycles.
