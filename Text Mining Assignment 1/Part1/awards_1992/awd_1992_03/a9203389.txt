Abstract    :

               This is the first year funding of a three-year continuing award.   Multimedia
              information systems have emerged as an essential  component of many application
              domains ranging from digital  libraries to entertainment technology.  However,
              most  implementations of these systems cannot support a continuous  display of
              multimedia objects and suffer from frequent disruptions  termed  hiccups . 
              This is due to the large size of these objects  that requires them to be almost
              always disk resident, and the  disparity between the low I/O bandwidth of the
              current disk  technology and the high bandwidth requirement of multimedia 
              objects.  To resolve this limitation, a multimedia object is  declustered
              across multiple disk drives, enabling the system to  utilize the aggregate
              bandwidth of multiple disks to support its  continuous retrieval.  Moreover,
              virtual data replication is being  developed as a mechanism to support
              simultaneous display of several  objects to different users.  This project
              investigates techniques  that: (1) provide on-line access to vast amount of
              multimedia data;  (2) minimize the response time of the system by prefetching
              data;  and (3) maximize the processing capability of the system by  optimizing
              the placement of the objects across the processors.  The  results of this
              research are expected to provide a foundation for  the development of high
              performance multimedia information systems  that can scale to thousands of
              processors.   ***
