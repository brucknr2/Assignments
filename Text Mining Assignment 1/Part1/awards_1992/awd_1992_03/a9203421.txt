Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Geometry has been viewed by many mathematics educators as a               
              natural context in which to introduce students to higher-order                 
              mathematical thinking.  Results of the Phase I Small Business                  
              Innovation Research (SBIR) study establish the technical basis                 
              for a new educational software tool, The Geometer's Sketchpad,                 
              that has as its purpose the provision of a visual environment                  
              with dynamic constructions, allowing students to investigate                   
              geometric shapes and relationships in ways that have heretofore                
              not been possible.  The research objectives of the Phase II                    
              research focus on (1) development and testing of prototype                     
              classroom materials; (2) development and testing of prototype                  
              software; (3) assessment of attitudes and achievement among                    
              various student populations using The Geometer's Sketchpad; and                
              (5) making The Geometer's Sketchpad accessible to the broadest                 
              range of students.  The project will provide software for                      
              applications that include enhanced versions of the software,                   
              versions for other hardware platforms, foreign language versions,              
              and books and collections of sketches/scripts for secondary,                   
              elementary, and university audiences.
