Abstract    :
                   The objective of this project is to develop a new form of                 
              designer system for modeling discrete products which is capable of             
              capturing the designer's intentions and all necessary life-cycle               
              considerations for a product.  The product modeler should also be              
              capable of propagating the intentions as part of the product                   
              information to the manufacturing planning systems using domain                 
              specific life-cycle issues as constraints in evaluating the design             
              and thus assuring concurrency of evaluation for life-cycle issues              
              of the product during the design process.                                      
                   This system will have a general framework for all discrete                
              product domains but will be developed domain by domain in a                    
              progression from sheet metal fabrication, to assembly, to machining            
              etc.  Finally, process planning modules (and other tractable non-              
              company specific planning systems) will be added for each domain               
              providing for a complete design and planning system.
