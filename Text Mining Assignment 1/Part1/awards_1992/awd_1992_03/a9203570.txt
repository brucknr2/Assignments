Abstract    :
              Dr. Hernando Trujillo has been awarded a Postdoctoral                          
              Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Truillo's doctoral degree was from                
              Dartmouth with Professor Russell Hughes. He plans to continue                  
              research with Professor Didier Astruc at Bordeaux. In Atruc's                  
              laboratory, he will learn about electron chain catalysis with                  
              transition metal catalysts. This will also bring him into                      
              contact with techniques stuch as Mossbauer spectroscopy, cyclic                
              voltammetry and ESR. These experiences will help him with his                  
              long range goal of studying highly strained molecules and                      
              addressing the questions of their reactivity.

              The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as                 
              an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the                   
              knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.'s and attract them into                  
              meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and                       
              teaching.
