Abstract    :
                   This proposal is concerned with the dynamics of some partial              
              differential equations that arise in mathematical physics.                     
              Problems concerning the method of accelerated convergence, KAM                 
              theory, center manifolds, and normal forms are complicated in the              
              finite dimensional case.  In infinite dimensions there are                     
              additional complications such as the appearance of zero divisors               
              rather that just small divisors.                                               
                   Dynamical systems is a geometric rigorous way of describing               
              the behavior of solutions of systems of ordinary or partial                    
              differential equations which can not be solved explicitly.  The                
              ability to accurately describe the behavior of such solutions has              
              important ramifications in understanding the world around us.
