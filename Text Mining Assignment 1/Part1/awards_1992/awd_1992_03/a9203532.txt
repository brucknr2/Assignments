Abstract    :
              This project is concerned with techniques for active selection of              
              training examples for neural network learning, while                           
              simultaneously growing the network to fit the data.  The approach              
              uses a statistical sampling criterion, Integrated Mean Squared                 
              Error, to derive a "greedy" selection criterion which picks the                
              next training example that maximizes the decrement in this                     
              measure.  This selection criterion is usable for a wide class                  
              estimators.  A practical realization of this schemes for multi-                
              layer neural networks is demonstrated.
