Abstract    :
                   This awards supports the research of Professor R. Friedman                
              to work in algebraic geometry.  He will continue to study the                  
              connections between the algebraic and smooth properties of                     
              4-manifolds.  In particular, he will try to decide if every                    
              complex surface diffeomorphic to a rational surface is itself                  
              rational and whether one can characterize smoothly embedded                    
              2-spheres of certain types lying on a complex surface.                         
                   The research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one of                
              the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which blossomed                
              to the point where it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems               
              that have stood for centuries. Originally, it treated figures                  
              defined in the plane by the simplest of equations, namely                      
              polynomials.  Today, the field uses methods not only from                      
              algebra, but also from analysis and topology, and conversely it                
              is extensively used in those fields.  Moreover, it has proved                  
              itself useful in fields as diverse as physics, theoretical                     
              computer science, cryptography, coding theory and robotics.
