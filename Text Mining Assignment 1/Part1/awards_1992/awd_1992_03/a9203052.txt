Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is grant is directed to experimental research on icosahedral              
              phase formation and stability in selected alloys.  Emphasized are              
              (1) determination of the atomic structure of the bcc Ti-Cr-Si                  
              approximant from precision powder and single crystal X-ray                     
              diffraction studies; (2) expansion of the investigation into                   
              related phases discovered in the Ti-Zr transition metal alloys; (3)            
              measurement of low and high temperature resistivity in bcc Ti-Cr-Si            
              to compare with the transport properties already measured in Al                
              crystalline approximants; (4) estimation of the glass-to-                      
              icosahedral phase and glass-to-alpha phase interfacial energies in             
              Al-Mn-Si; (5)  extension of an atomic model for Al-Mn to predict               
              the structure of Al-Co-Cu.                                                     
              %%%                                                                            
              Research on icosahedral phase structure and stability provides an              
              important link to metallic glasses and complex intermetallic                   
              alloys.  Understanding formation of these phases is required for               
              improved metal alloy design.
