Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This project will provide for participation in the creation               
              and operation of ALOMAR, an Arctic Lidar Observatory for Middle                
              Atmosphere Research.  In conjunction with other CEDAR and European             
              lidar programs, the PIs will develop a high-power laser providing              
              sodium temperature and wind measurement capabilities with ALOMAR.              
              This research, when completed, will address a range of geophysical             
              processes occurring at high latitudes, but having global                       
              implications, using unique capabilities among current atmospheric              
              lidars.
