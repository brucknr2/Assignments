Abstract    :
              It is suggested that undrained steady state (or residual)                      
              strength, and associated (critical) confining pressure can be                  
              assessed in a straightforward manner from drained triaxial tests               
              with volume change measurements based on a proposed effective                  
              stress interpretation of such undrained behavior. If the                       
              envisioned procedure can be verified as part of this study, it                 
              should be possible for all geotechnical firms with the standard                
              laboratory capability to perform drained triaxial tests on sands               
              (with associated volume change measurements) to accurately assess              
              the residual strength of such liquefying material, which                       
              otherwise require sophisticated equipment beyond the capability                
              of the great majority of geotechnical firms.
