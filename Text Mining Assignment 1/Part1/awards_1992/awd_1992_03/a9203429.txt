Abstract    :
              This research project will apply recently developed geometrical                
              methods for analyzing dynamical systems towards the area of large              
              amplitude motions of a small fishing vessel. The methods to be                 
              applied include Poincare, maps, invariant manifolds, lobe                      
              analysis and Melnikov vector analysis. To achieve a more                       
              realistic model of ship capsizing, the approach will be global,                
              admitting multiple degrees of freedom and multiple frequency                   
              excitations. The products of this research effort are expected to              
              lead to a better understanding of the interaction of vessel and                
              environment characteristics influencing vessel stability.***
