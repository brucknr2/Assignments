Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports a research and development program                         
              investigating various aspects of adaptive optics and high                      
              resolution imaging techniques for astronomy.  Areas to be                      
              investigated include the development of innovative methods of                  
              wavefront sensing using the properties of natural starlight and                
              fast, low noise detectors in both visible and near infrared                    
              wavelengths, and the incorporation of speckle imaging, tip/tilt                
              correction for image motion and full adaptive correction in                    
              scienceprograms at the 2.3 meter and 6.86 meter Multiple Mirror                
              telescopes of the Steward Observatory.  Graduate students will be              
              involved in the development and use of these techniques.
