Abstract    :
                   The evolution of ecological specialization is a major theme               
              in evolutionary history.  The evolutionary consequences of such                
              specialization have received considerable attention, but have                  
              rarely been studied using knowledge of phylogenetic relationships              
              of the taxa involved, a prerequisite for answering many kinds of               
              evolutionary questions.  This research will involve an                         
              investigation of the evolutionary consequences of trophic                      
              specialization in garter snakes (genus Thamnophis) using an                    
              explicitly phylogenetic approach.  The first part of the study                 
              tests hypotheses that certain traits (head shapes and visual                   
              characteristics) are adaptations for a specialized underwater                  
              foraging mode.  The investigation will provide an especially                   
              powerful examination of adaptive hypotheses by combining within a              
              phylogenetic context (1) comparative tests of the evolutionary                 
              association of head shape and visual traits with feeding mode,                 
              and (2) experimental analyses of trait function.  The second part              
              of the study will involve rigorous phylogenetic and statistical                
              tests of the idea that specialist taxa are constrained in their                
              subsequent evolution.  These tests will focus on trophic niche                 
              transitions among terrestrial specialists, aquatic specialists,                
              and generalist garter snakes.  This examination of constraint                  
              will complement the tests of adaptation, because contraints on                 
              niche transitions provide the evolutionary boundaries within                   
              which the adaptive changes occur.
