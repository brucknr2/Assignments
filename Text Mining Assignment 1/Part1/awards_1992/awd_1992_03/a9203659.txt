Abstract    :
                   This project focuses mathematical research on problems of                 
              approximation and special functions.  The latter comprise the                  
              basis of much of approximation theory, although there is a                     
              considerable body of work concentrating on analysis of the                     
              functions themselves.  Work to be done includes studies of                     
              weighted potential and weighted polynomials in the complex plane,              
              asymptotics for orthogonal polynomials and special functions,                  
              roots of polynomials and extremal problems for Blaschke products               
              and rational functions.  Work will also be done on the degree of               
              approximation by Bernstein operators and Bergman kernel methods                
              for numerical conformal mapping.                                               
                   Approximation is the defining feature of mathematical                     
              analysis.  Compact expressions of solutions of problems arising                
              in the physical universe rarely occur.  More often, the solutions              
              must be approximated by known quantities which have desirable                  
              properties and are easily computed.  This research contributes to              
              the dual goals of understanding the special functions of analysis              
              and discovering their approximation properties.
