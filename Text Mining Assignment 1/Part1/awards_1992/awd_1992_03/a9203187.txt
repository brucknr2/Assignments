Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The award will allow the purchase a new Finnigan Mass Spectrometer             
              for the paleoceanography group at Woods Hole Oceanographic                     
              Institution.  A multi-sample "Kiel" device is also be installed for            
              the capability to analyze a large number of samples automatically              
              around the clock.  Office of Naval Research and the Institution                
              will share the cost of the new machine.  The Woods Hole                        
              paleoceanographic community consists of nine very productive PIs               
              and the existing mass spec facilities are either dedicated to                  
              specialized use of cannot accept a large addition load of isotopic             
              analyses.
