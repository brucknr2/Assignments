Abstract    :
              Gonzaga University is establishing a connection to NSFNET via a                
              56,000 bits per second line through the NorthWestNet mid-level                 
              network.  The connection enables the school's faculty and students             
              to communicate and collaborate with the national scientific and                
              educational community, and to access network resources.  Areas of              
              science to be addressed on the Internet by Gonzaga include physics,            
              computer science, engineering and mathematics.  Gonzaga is also                
              implementing a Center for Information and Technology, which will               
              serve as a resource accessible over the Internet housing databases             
              in scientific, economic, demographic and technological fields.                 
              This award funds part of the costs for one year.
