Abstract    :
                   Pillay intends to investigate:  1) some problems in the model             
              theory of differential fields, among them the possible existence of            
              a superstable non-differentially closed differential field;  2)                
              some problems involving the number of models of both countable and             
              uncountable stable theories;  3) the possibility of defining a                 
              field in sufficiently rich o-minimal structures, and the                       
              identification of groups definable in o-minimal structures.                    
                   The subarea of model theory within mathematical logic concerns            
              itself with axiomatic systems, particularly questions about                    
              theories founded on systems of axioms, which can be answered purely            
              from considering the forms of the axioms without real regard for               
              their content.  It is surprising how much can sometimes be learned             
              in this way, for it often seems to be getting something for                    
              nothing.  Model theorists have developed a rich subject and have               
              been able to shed light even on such well-studied topics in algebra            
              as the theory of groups and the theory of fields.
