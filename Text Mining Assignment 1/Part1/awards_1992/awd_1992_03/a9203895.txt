Abstract    :
              Shin         This is a project to build and experiment with a  multiprocessor
              for real-time applications.  The multiprocessor  will ultimately consist of 19
              nodes arranged in a hexagonal mesh,  with each node containing three 68020
              processors for computation,  a commercial controller for communications
              control, and a custom  chip for communications routing.  An initial
              multiprocessor  containing only a few nodes is being developed to allow 
              experimentation that will guide full-scale construction.   Experiments on the
              system consist largely of synthetic benchmark  programs produced by a workload
              generator.  The workload  generator produces benchmarks that have computation, 
              communication, and deadline characteristics of several classes of 
              applications, but are easier to vary an instrument than real  applications
              would be.
