Abstract    :
              This project seeks to develop controller design procedures for                 
              repetitive control systems that relate controller design to                    
              specified levels of performance of the system. Procedures will be              
              developed for the simplified case of repetitive controllers with               
              large time delay values as well as the more general case where                 
              the time delay values are not large. The controller design                     
              procedure will be based on H infinity control theory and robust                
              performance will be sought. Available theory for H infinity                    
              control of distributed parameter systems will be modified and                  
              applied to repetitive control systems. Currently available                     
              repetitive controllers will also be viewed in an H infinity                    
              framework so that the relationship of weights used in the H                    
              infinity problem and the resulting controller is better                        
              understood. It is expected that the H infinity repetitive                      
              controllers designed using this approach will perform at least as              
              well as currently available repetitive controllers. Usefulness of              
              the controller design procedures developed here and of the                     
              controllers themselves will be established by application to                   
              closed loop servohydraulic testing. The use of servohydraulic                  
              actuators raises considerations of actuator-related                            
              nonlinearities which are specific to this application. These                   
              nonlinear effects will be characterized as model error, in terns               
              compatible with the H infinity  controller design procedure.                   
              Furthermore, the stability of repetitive control systems with                  
              these nonlinear effects will be evaluated by appropriate                       
              stability analysis techniques.***  //
