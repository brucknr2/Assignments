Abstract    :
              In this project, the Principal Investigators will collaborate                  
              with Russian and Canadian scientists in a repeated survey of the               
              upper 1500 meters of the subtropical and subpolar North Pacific.               
              The total program includes four surveys of the Oyashio/Kamchatka               
              Current region, one geochemistry cruise in the western North                   
              Pacific, and spring and fall trans-Pacific cruises each year for               
              four years that cover all the major circulation features north of              
              the Subtropical Front.  US participation in the two trans-Pacific              
              cruises, will allow the PI's to gain access to the entire data                 
              set, allowing them to study a number of major questions related                
              to North Pacific circulation.
