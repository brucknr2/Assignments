Abstract    :
              &r. John T. Fourkas has been awarded a Postdoctoral Fellowship                 
              in Chemistry. Dr. Fourkas' doctoral degree was from Stanford                   
              University under the supervision of Professor Michael Fayer.                   
              Dr. Fourkas intends to continue research at The University of                  
              Texas/Austin under the sponsorship of Profesor Mark Berg. Dr.                  
              Fourkas' area of postdoctoral research will be in ultrafast                    
              condensed-phase dynamics.  He will build and use femtosecond                   
              laser systems and learn about optical coherence techniques.                    
              The postdoctoral experience will ultimately be applied to study                
              the dynamics of liquids in constrained media such as zeolites,                 
              micelles and porous glasses.                                                   
              %%%                                                                            
              The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as                 
              an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the                   
              knowledge and experience of new Ph.D's and attract them into                   
              meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and                       
              teaching.
