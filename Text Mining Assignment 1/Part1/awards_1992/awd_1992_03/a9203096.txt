Abstract    :
              This is a proposal for modern nucleic acid sequence analysis                   
              instrumentation.  Sequencing experiments to be pursued                         
              include: (1) sequencing of cloned mutant genes for the                         
              enzyme luciferase in order to better characterize the active                   
              site of the enzyme, (2) sequencing of the regulatory regions                   
              of the lux operons of Vibrio harveyi and Xenorhabdus                           
              luminescens, (3) sequencing of cloned fragments containing                     
              recombinational hot-spots to determine orientation, (4)                        
              sequencing of the products of confirmed in vitro                               
              recombination to characterize the recombinational event, (5)                   
              sequencing of other members of a new family of retroviral                      
              sequences found in as many as thirty copies per mouse                          
              genome, and (6) sequencing of portions of a novel transposon                   
              in Streptococcus suis which mediates its own transfer via                      
              conjugation.
