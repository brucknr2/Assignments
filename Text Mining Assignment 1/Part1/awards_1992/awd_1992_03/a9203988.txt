Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The study will analyze a unique set of seismic data from the                   
              Endeavor segment of Juan de Fuca Ridge collected 1991 to determine             
              patterns of seismicity, its correlation to vent activity and to                
              test the hypothesis of two types of earthquake systems on this part            
              of the Ridge.  This study will help lead to an understanding of                
              time scales of ridge processes and help plan the future long-term              
              RIDGE observatory in the area to be deployed in 1994-95.
