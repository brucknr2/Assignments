Abstract    :
              The Fellow will study cycling of high-field-strength elements                  
              in the mantle by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry.                 
              An important component to the theory of plate tectonics is the                 
              cycling of material from the mantle to the crust at ocean ridges,              
              and back into the mantle at subduction zones.  High-field                      
              strength elements (HFSE)  will be used to study basalts erupted                
              at volcanic arcs, where they tend to be low in HFSE, and basalts               
              erupted on oceanic islands that tend to be enriched in HFSE.                   
              This study should evaluate the hypothesis that major basaltic                  
              volcanism on Earth is part of a cycle, formed at ocean ridges,                 
              subducted at ocean trenches, undergoes reactions that lead to arc              
              volcanism, and eventually resurfaces as plumes feeding ocean                   
              islands.  The Fellow will spend her fellowship tenure at Cornell               
              University.
