Abstract    :
                   Professor Gillet will continue his work on Arakelov theory                
              and arithmetic Riemann-Roch type theorems.  He will also work on               
              Gersten's conjecture in Algebraic K-theory and connections                     
              between Lichtenbaum's conjectures on K-theory and Regulators and               
              arithmetic intersection theory.                                                
                   This project falls into the general area of arithmetic                    
              geometry - a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of                    
              mathematics: number theory and geometry.  This combination has                 
              proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems              
              that withstood generations.  Among its many consequences are new               
              error correcting codes.  Such codes are essential for both modern              
              computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
