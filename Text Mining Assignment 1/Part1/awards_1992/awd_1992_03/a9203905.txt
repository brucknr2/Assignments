Abstract    :
                   Logical methods are playing an increasingly important role                
              in many areas of computer science and mathematics.  The                        
              applications of logical methods to problems in both areas, in                  
              particular, the ways in which logical methods can be applied to                
              understand the theory of computation including the study of the                
              effective or computational content of theorems in mathematics and              
              how logical methods can be used to solve a variety of problems in              
              computer science are the foci of this conference activity.                     
              Topics will include recursion theory, recursive and polynomial                 
              time mathematics, the general theory of computation, automata,                 
              complexity theory, and various other applications of logic within              
              computer science including non-classical logics such as temporal               
              and dynamic logic, concurrent programming, nonmonotonic                        
              reasoning, program verification, and hybrid control.                           
                   This project will support the Meeting on Logical Methods in               
              Mathematics and Computer Science to be held at Cornell University              
              from June 1-3, 1992.  The purpose of this conference is to bring               
              together researchers from both mathematics and computer science                
              to explore the many applications of logical methods to problems                
              in both areas and to increase the interaction between                          
              mathematical logicians and computer scientists.
