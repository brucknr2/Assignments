Abstract    :
              This project will explore several basic algorithmic questions                  
              in symbolic algebraic computation and investigate their                        
              applications to geometric modeling.  The overall goal of the                   
              project is to design, analyze and test efficient algorithms                    
              for solving systems of polynomial equations and related                        
              problems, and to test their applicability to geometric                         
              modeling problems.  The specific problem areas to be studied                   
              are: analysis of algorithms for solving system of polynomial                   
              equations such as the Wu-Ritt characteristic set algorithm and                 
              Lazard's triangular set algorithm; developing variations of                    
              these and other algorithms to efficiently handle systems of                    
              polynomial equation of special interest; designing efficient                   
              new algorithms based on Grobner bases and a new basis                          
              conversion algorithm for manipulation of polynomial ideals;                    
              investigation of the properties of the general Dixon resultant                 
              and algorithms for computing it; and exploration of the use of                 
              these techniques in solving algorithmic problems in geometric                  
              modeling.  The design and analysis of the various algorithms                   
              will be accompanied by experimentation with trial                              
              implementations on existing computer algebra systems.  The aim                 
              of the experimentation will be to incorporate possible                         
              improvements suggested by the analysis and to uncover                          
              phenomena that might possibly be missed out in the analysis.                   
              Fine tuned implementations of a few special purpose algorithms                 
              are also planned.
