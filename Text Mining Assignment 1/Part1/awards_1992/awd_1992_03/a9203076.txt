Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                  
              Program provides continued support for the research program of                 
              Dr. John E. Bercaw of the Chemistry Department, California                     
              Institute of Technology.  The research will focus on the                       
              mechanisms of reactions of organometallic compounds.  Selective                
              catalytic oxidation of hydrocarbons and other organic                          
              substrates will be investigated in detail.  Kinetic and                        
              thermodynamic factors which influence the formation and                        
              cleavage of C-O, H-O, and M-O or M=O bonds will be emphasized,                 
              as well as 1,2 addition reactions to C-H bonds.                                
              Cyclopentadienyl compounds of tantalum and high valent                         
              ruthenium and iron oxo compounds which contain ancilliary                      
              O,O,O-tripodal ligands will be used.

              Conversion of methane and other light alkanes to liquids, such                 
              as alcohols or higher hydrocarbons, could simplify transport of                
              these energy sources and enable the first step of their                        
              conversion to specialty chemical products.  By developing new                  
              types of transtion metal compounds which are capable of                        
              oxidizing organic substrates and providing a better                            
              understanding of the kinetic and thermodynamic factors                         
              operative in these reactions, improved oxidation catalysts may                 
              be developed.  During the course of these fundamental studies,                 
              new compounds will be synthesized and careful investigations of                
              the steps of the oxidation reactions will be carried out.
