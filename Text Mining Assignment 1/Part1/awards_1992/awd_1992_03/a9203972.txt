Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator plans to extend his recent                     
              results on the existence of nonsingular globally defined                       
              solutions of the Einstein/Yang-Mills field equations and to                    
              attempt to find asymptotically flat "black-hole" solutions whose               
              existence would refute the so-called hair trigger conjecture.                  
                   These problems impact upon both gravitational physics and                 
              relativity theory and have the potential of determining the role               
              of geometry  when gravity is modeled by Einstein's theory of                   
              relativity.
