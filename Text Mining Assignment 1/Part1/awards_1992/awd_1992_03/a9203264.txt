Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The proposed research is to support numerical simulations and             
              theoretical modelling of the low latitude thermosphere and                     
              ionosphere as part of the proposed MISETA initiative.  MISETA                  
              (Multi-Instrument Studies of Equatorial Thermosphere Aeronomy)                 
              seeks to carry out measurements at Jicamarca and Arequipa, Peru, by            
              coherent and incoherent scatter radar, digisonde, spaced                       
              scintillation reciever, Fabry Perot interferometer and all-sky                 
              imager.  These instruments will provide data on the neutral and                
              inoized atmosphere including measurements of vertical and zonal                
              drifts, electron densities, ion, electron, and neutral                         
              temperatures, zonal and mericonal neutral winds, and spread_F and              
              electrojet observations.  Emphasis is on the coupled thermosphere-             
              ionosphere dynamics; topics to be explored include the role of                 
              atmosphereic gravity waves in seeing spread-F phenomena, the                   
              importance of latitudinal gradients in the zonal neutral wind and              
              interhemispheric transport for equatorial electrodynamics, the                 
              significance of the midnight pressure bulge in understanding the               
              onset of spread-F and its dependence upon season, and geomagnetic              
              storm effects at low latitudes.                                                
                                                                                             
                   This particular proposal seeks funding to allow participation             
              of a graduate student at Dartmouth College in the MISETA                       
              initiative.  The student would participate in numerical simulations            
              of the MISETA data sets and theoretical studies with the NCAR                  
              thermosphere-ionosphere general circulation model (TIGCM) and the              
              thermosphere-ionosphere-electrodynamics general circulation model              
              (TIEGCM).
