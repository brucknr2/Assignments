Abstract    :
                   This project has three specific areas of study: Efficient                 
              Channel-Based Equalization, the computation of the equalizer via               
              channel characterization derived from embedded training data;                  
              Interference Rejection for Code-Division Multiple Access, near-far             
              and intersymbol interference and interference from disparate users;            
              and Multicarrier Methods for Broadcast Transmission, for mitigation            
              of time-varying fading effects.   The focus of the study is on the             
              time-varying multipath data channel.  At relatively low data rates,            
              the time-varying nature of wireless communication channels often               
              leads to channel variation over a small number of symbol intervals.            
              In this case a significant amount of training data can be embedded             
              in the transmitted packets of data to enable adjustments to be made            
              at the receiver.  An alternative, perhaps forced by the need for               
              higher data rates, is to increase the bandwidth of the transmitted             
              signal. Then the relative rate of channel variation is less                    
              compared to the symbol rate, and the fraction of training is                   
              reduced.  As wider bandwidths are used, multipath effects become               
              more important and more sophisticated receiver structures need to              
              be used. The research studies both narrow and wideband                         
              transmission, for applications in digital cellular radio and                   
              digital broadcast channels.
