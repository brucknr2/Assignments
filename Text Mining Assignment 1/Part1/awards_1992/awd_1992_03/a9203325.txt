Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is a continuation of the PI's numerical model                     
              work on the Leeuwin Current off western Australia.  The primary                
              goal of the numerical experiments is to study the roles of seasonal            
              ocean thermal forcing and seasonal wind forcing in the observed                
              seasonal structure of the Leeuwin Current.  Extensions of previous             
              work include the incorporation into the model of bottom topography             
              and continuously-forced and seasonally varying thermal and wind                
              forcing.
