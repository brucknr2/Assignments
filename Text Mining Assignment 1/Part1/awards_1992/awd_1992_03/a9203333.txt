Abstract    :
                   The objective of this research is to apply recently                       
              developed ideas and techniques from statistical mechanics,                     
              plasma physics, and, particularly, dynamical systems theory to                 
              problems involving the evolution of self-gravitating systems                   
              of objects, both Newtonianly and in general relativity.  One                   
              general problem to be considered is the "relaxation" and                       
              stability of galaxies and galactic nuclei.  Two principal aims                 
              here are (a) to understand from first principles the origins                   
              of the observed similarities amongst galaxies, a nontrivial                    
              issue in that the nominal relaxation time tR is typically                      
              orders of magnitude larger than the age of the Universe; and                   
              related to this, (b) to understand how galaxies respond to                     
              strong external stimuli, as provided, e.g., by collisions with                 
              other galaxies, by very rapidly evolving towards a new                         
              statistical equilibrium.  The other area to be considered                      
              entails an application of ideas from statistical physics to                    
              quantum field theory in the early Universe.  Two principal                     
              aims here are (a) the modeling of phase transitions and other                  
              quantum field theoretic processes as simple stochastic                         
              processes and (b) an analysis of particle creation in the                      
              early Universe, with the ultimate aim of obtaining an improved                 
              understanding of "gravitational entropy" and the observed                      
              "arrow of time."
