Abstract    :
                   Theoretical research in elementary particle physics will                  
              attempt to further elucidate the structure of particles which                  
              interact via the strong nuclear force.  The technique to be                    
              used replaces the space - time continuum by a discrete lattice                 
              of points.  Some of the calculations will be aimed at testing                  
              the reliability of this technique.  Since the technique is in                  
              wide use in a number of applications, this test is important.                  
              Clearly, so too is the effort to better understand the                         
              structure of the particles.
