Abstract    :
                   Research will be carried out on the properties of neutrinos,              
              specifically the oscillation between muon- and electron-like                   
              neutrinos and anti-neutrinos, which occurs by virtue of their                  
              having different, albeit very small masses.  A large detector                  
              being built at the LAMPF laboratory will be used in conjunction                
              with the LAMPF beam stop as a source of muon neutrinos.  New                   
              limits on the mass difference will be set, thus providing basic                
              information on these fundamental particles, and facilitating                   
              comparison with mass differences inferred from direct observation              
              of solar neutrinos.  The PI and undergraduate students will carry              
              out development of various elements of the data acquisition                    
              system, both hardware and software.
