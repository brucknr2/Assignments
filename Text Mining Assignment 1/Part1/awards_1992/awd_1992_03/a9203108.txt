Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              New "engineered" thermoplastics are polymer-polymer blends                     
              which have a high modulus, good toughness, and high softening                  
                                                                                             
              temperatures.  They can therefore be used in designed                          
              structures which typically require metals.  Other polymer                      
              blends have special properties that permit them to be used for                 
                                                                                             
              particular applications.  Most blends are made by mixing two                   
              or more immiscible polymers in the molten state.  Their                        
              multiphase structure must be stabilized to prevent coalescence                 
                                                                                             
              when the blend is extruded or molded by a polymer processor.                   
                                                                                             
              The main method for compatibilization is to use a block                        
              copolymer which can act like a polymeric soap to stabilize the                 
                                                                                             
              morphology.  This block copolymer can be premade and                           
              compounded into the mixture or it can be formed in situ by                     
              coupling reactions between the two different chains.                           
                                                                                             
              A research program is planned to understand and control the                    
              morphology which develops during melt mixing.  Two model pairs                 
                                                                                             
              of immiscible polymers, polystyrene (PS) and poly(2-                           
              vinylpyridine) PVP, and linear low density polyethylene (LLPE)                 
                                                                                             
              and poly(ethylene-co-polypropylene) PEP will be used as test                   
              materials.  The LLDPE/PEP system offers unique opportunities                   
              since it can be made miscible at elevated temperatures.                        
              Morphologies created by precipitation from the miscible melts                  
                                                                                             
              will be compared by mixing immiscible melts and by reactive                    
              coupling.  New and useful morphologies should result from this                 
                                                                                             
              research as well as strategies and quantitative models for                     
              efficient compatibilization of polymer blends.
