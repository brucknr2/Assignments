Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              During the last glacial period temperatures were colder, the                   
              thermocline base was shallower, nutrient concentrations were lower             
              and oxygen minimum zone was indistinct.  The PI will examine                   
              isotopic variations in formaminifera south of the glacial polar                
              front in the North Atlantic to learn more about their relationship             
              to thermocline and its dynamics and the changes in glacial polar               
              front.
