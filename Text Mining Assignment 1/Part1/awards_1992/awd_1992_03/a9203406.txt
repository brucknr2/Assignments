Abstract    :
                   Algorithms will be constructed to calculate generalized                   
              solutions of problems arising in the calculus of variations that               
              involve non-convex bulk energy functionals and which have no                   
              classical minima.  The generalized solutions, consisting of a                  
              parameterized Young measure and a weak limit (of a minimizing                  
              sequence) do exist and will be calculated numerically by these                 
              algorithms.  The proposed approach offers considerable economy                 
              over direct simulation of the oscillatory minimizing sequences                 
              since the weak limit and Young measure are slowly varying                      
              quantities in general, which may be well approximated using                    
              coarse meshes.                                                                 
                   In many physical problems, the observed macroscopic                       
              properties are averages of fine-scale quantities visible only                  
              through optical or possibly electron microscopes.  For example,                
              many common metals consist of layers of several distinctly                     
              different component metals.  The problem of determining the                    
              properties of such a materials by direct averaging over the fine               
              layers is beyond the scope of current computers.  The Young                    
              measure characterizes the averaged properties very succinctly.                 
              In this project, the theory of Young measures will be utilized to              
              develop computer codes capable of determining both the                         
              microscopic and macroscopic properties of such materials.
