Abstract    :
                   This grant supports the research of Professor N. Katz as                  
              principal investigator and Drs. H. Darmon and F. Rodriquez-                    
              Villegas as post-doctoral associates.  Professor Katz will work                
              on the l-adic cohomology of varieties over finite fields, the                  
              l-adic theory of exponential sums and the arithmetic theory of                 
              differential equations.  Dr. Darmon will study relations between               
              the arithmetic of schemes and the analytic properties of                       
              l-functions.  Dr. Rodriquez-Villegas will study the arithmetic                 
              properties of special values of l-functions of CM-fields.                      
                   This project falls into the general area of arithmetic                    
              geometry - a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of                    
              mathematics: number theory and geometry.  This combination has                 
              proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems              
              that withstood generations.  Among its many consequences are new               
              error correcting codes.  Such codes are essential for both modern              
              computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
