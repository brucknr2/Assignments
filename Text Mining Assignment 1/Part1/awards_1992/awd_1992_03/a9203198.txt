Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The PIs propose to operate the CEDAR Class-I Imaging System               
              compiling a multi-wavelength database containing sub-auroral                   
              phenomena.  Topics the PIs will study include:  (1) investigation              
              of the under-reported and poorly understood temporal/spatial                   
              variabilities in Stabel Auroral Red arcs, (2) study of ionospheric             
              storms and field-aligned current signatures upon the sub-auroral               
              ionosphere, and (3) continuing development of a prototype imaging              
              spectrograph for use with a bare CCD detector.
