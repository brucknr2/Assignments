              This is an individual award for the Postdoctoral Fellowship in                 
              Plant Biology.  The applicant received his Ph.D. from the                      
              University of California at Los Angeles in molecular biology                   
              studying the regulation of membrane protein genes in Lemna.  He                
              plans to carry out his postdoctoral fellowship research in the                 
              laboratory of Dr. Arthur R. Grossman at Carnegie Institution of                
              Washington at Stanford.  His research entitled "Generation and                 
              Characterization of mutants in chromatic adaptation In Fremyella               
              diplosiphon" will broaden the applicant's scientific training into             
              photobiology and environmental biology.
