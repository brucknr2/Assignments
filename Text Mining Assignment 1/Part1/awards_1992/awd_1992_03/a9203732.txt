Abstract    :
              This research develops an existing scalable fault-tolerant and                 
              visually programmable platform called GLU which enables                        
              parallel application to be run on existing hardware.                           
                                                                                             
              The essential property of GLU that makes it all work is the                    
              way it actually combines declarative and procedural code.  GLU                 
              programs consist of a declarative top layer and lower layers                   
              of procedural code, e.g., C or FORTRAN.  The procedural code                   
              is written without thinking about parallel evaluation.  All                    
              the parallelism and the fault tolerance come from the                          
              declarative level.                                                             
                                                                                             
              GLU will be developed by making improvements at various                        
              levels: in the range of machines that can be used, in                          
              performance (and measurement thereof), in the                                  
              declarative/procedural interface to allow systematic reuse of                  
              existing code, in the graphical specification of the                           
              declarative layer, and in the graphical layer itself.
