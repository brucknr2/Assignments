Abstract    :
              Dr. Theresa C. Kavanaugh has been awarded a Postdoctoral                       
              Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Kavanaugh' doctoral degree was                    
              from MIT with Professor Robert Silbey. She intends to continue                 
              research with Dr. Richard Stratt at Brown. In his laboratory,                  
              she will learn about liquid structure and cultivate an                         
              understanding of semiconductor liquids. This will build on the                 
              knowledge she has gained on non-linear properties and prepare                  
              her for her long range career goals of understanding surface                   
              effects of semiconductor clusters through the use of                           
              theoretical studies.

              The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as                 
              an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the                   
              knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.'s and attract them into                  
              meaningful careers in contemporary chemical resesearch and                     
              teaching.
