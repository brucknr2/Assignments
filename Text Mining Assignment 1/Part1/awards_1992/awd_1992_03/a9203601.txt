Abstract    :
              Dr. Eugene G. Mueller has been awarded a Postdoctoral                          
              Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Mueller's doctoral degree was from                
              Harvard under the supervision of Professor Jeremy Knowles. He                  
              intends to continue his research with Professor John Bercaw at                 
              the California Institute of Technology. Dr. Mueller's thesis                   
              work involved studies of the stereochemistry of phosphoryl                     
              transfers. He plans to do postdoctoral work in basic inorganic                 
              chemistry studying agostic interactions in catalyis and                        
              learning about oxidation of substrates by ruthenium based                      
              systems. This will help prepare him for his long range career                  
              goals of the chemical modelling of the myo-inositol oxidase                    
              enzyme.                                                                        
              %%%                                                                            
              The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as                 
              an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the                   
              knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.'s and attract them into                  
              meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and                       
              teaching.
