Abstract    :
                   The goal of this research is to develop algorithms for                    
              identifying a low-order phase-type distribution which matches,                 
              exactly or as nearly as possible, given specifications such as                 
              moments.  The motivation for the research is the extensive                     
              literature on stochastic models based on phase-type distributions.             
              Many of these models may be solved by straight forward algorithms.             
              If these are to be used in applications, then methods are needed               
              for specifying the phase-type distributions involved.  There is                
              much research underway on fitting phase-type distributions,                    
              motivated by the algorithms available for them.  This research                 
              emphasizes fitting low-order distributions.  The reason for this               
              emphasis is that the size of the state space of a model, and hence             
              also the computational burden in solving it, typically depend                  
              multiplicatively on the orders of the phase-type distributions used            
              in the model.  Thus it is important to keep the order as small as              
              possible.  This direction in fitting phase-type distributions has              
              not been explored systematically to date.                                      
                   The techniques are largely based on recent developments in the            
              theory of phase-type distributions.  Bringing these ideas to bear              
              on the practical problem of fitting low-order phase-type                       
              distributions is an important step in the development of the phase             
              methodology.
