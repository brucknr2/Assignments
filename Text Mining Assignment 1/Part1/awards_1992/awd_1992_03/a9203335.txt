Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award provides supplemental funds to Physics grant 9100221                
              which provided support for construction of the high resolution                 
              eye detector, a set of instrumentation which allows scientists to              
              study the nature and origin of the highest energy cosmic rays.                 
              The additional funding provided in this award will allow the US                
              scientists to work with Chinese scientists who are conducting                  
              another experiment, in China, which exposes photographic emulsion              
              to cosmic rays.  Data produced by the Chinese experiment is                    
              complementary to the data from the US experiment, and through                  
              this collaboration, both groups will have ready access to each                 
              body of data for comparison.  The Chinese facility is located in               
              Tibet, and without cooperation of this kind, it would be unlikely              
              that US scientists would have access to the data obtained there.               
              Chinese scientists will also visit the US to work directly with                
              the team of scientists at the US facility in Utah.
