Abstract    :
              This is an individual award for the Postdoctoral Fellowship in                 
              Plant Biology.  The applicant received her Ph.D. from the                      
              University of Massachusetts and her Ph.D. research was in plant                
              virology.  She plans to carry out her postdoctoral fellowship                  
              research in the laboratory of Dr. Martin Yanofsky at University of             
              California at San Diego.  The proposed research entitled                       
              "Transcription factors in flower development: the role of the                  
              AGAMOUS gene product" will broaden the training of the Fellow into             
              plant molecular genetics and developmental biology.
