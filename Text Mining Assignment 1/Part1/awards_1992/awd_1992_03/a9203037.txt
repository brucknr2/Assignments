Abstract    :
              The Principal Investigator will spend the 1992-93 academic year                
              in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University              
              of Arizona conducting field work on the ecology and evolution of               
              nectarivorous bat-cactus interactions in the Sonoran desert.  Two              
              hypotheses will be examined in this research: (1) the                          
              phylogeography of the migratory nectar-feeding bat Leptonycterid               
              curasoae conforms to the type I pattern of Avise et al. (1987):                
              there should be strong phylogenetic continuity within subspecies               
              and a strong genetic separation between subspecies; northern                   
              migrants of the Mexican species represent a random draw from                   
              southern populations and (2) sex ratios in the trioecious, bat-                
              pollinated cactus Pachycereus pringlei vary geographically with                
              the proportion of females in populations being positively                      
              correlated with the availability of nectarivorous bats.  The P.I.              
              will use mtDNA techniques to test the first hypothesis and                     
              observational techniques to test the second hypothesis.  When not              
              in the field he P.I. will work in the Laboratory of Molecular                  
              Evolution and Molecular Systematics to learn molecular techniques              
              (e.g. mtDNA and cpDNA restriction site analysis) and methods of                
              phylogenetic analysis.  These techniques are essential for future              
              studies of the historical ecology of bat-plant interactions in                 
              New World desert ecosystems.
