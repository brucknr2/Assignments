Abstract    :
                   Professor Silverberg will continue her work on Shimura                    
              varieties.  In particular, she plans to study adelic                           
              representations attached to points on canonical models of                      
              arithmetic quotients of bounded symmetric domains.  She also                   
              intends to work on questions about the fields obtained by                      
              adjoining torsion points on Abelian Varieties.                                 
                   This project falls into the general area of arithmetic                    
              geometry - a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of                    
              mathematics: number theory and geometry.  This combination has                 
              proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems              
              that withstood generations.  Among its many consequences are new               
              error correcting codes.  Such codes are essential for both modern              
              computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
