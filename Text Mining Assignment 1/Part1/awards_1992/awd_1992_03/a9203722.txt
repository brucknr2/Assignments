Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal outlined a program to examine the structure,                     
              chemistry, and electronic structure of the oxide eutectic                      
              interfaces in two-phase oxide systems, particularly the                        
              directionally solidified eutectics, using the state-of-the-art 200             
              kV field emission TEM and under ultra-clean conditions using a                 
              UHV-HREM.  Multiple views of the interfaces in two-phase oxides aid            
              the visualization of interfacial relaxation and characterization of            
              interface structure in three dimensions.  The relaxation mechanisms            
              and interface defects will be analyzed within the context of the               
              bicrystallography  theory and compared with computer simulated                 
              structures.  The program includes also the in-situ/ex-situ heating             
              and diffusion experiments to observe and anylyze dynamic properties            
              of interfaces.                                                                 
              %%%%                                                                           
              This proposal utilizes unique characterization techniques,                     
              including field emission TEM under ultra-clean conditions, to                  
              characterize the interface structure and defects in two-phase oxide            
              systems.  Interfacial relaxation will be studied to delineate the              
              mechanisms, and the observed results will be compared with                     
              computer-simulated structures.  The results can have general                   
              applicabilities in the oxide studies.
