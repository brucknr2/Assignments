Abstract    :
              This is an individual award for the Postdoctoral Fellowship in                 
              Plant Biology.  The applicant received his Ph.D. in biophysics at              
              the University of California at Berkeley.  He proposes to carry out            
              his fellowship research ion the laboratories of Dr. Michael                    
              Freeling and Dr. Russell Jones at University of California at                  
              Berkeley.  The research entitled "The role of calcium as an                    
              effector of growth in maize primary root gravitropism:                         
              physiological and genetic studies" concerns the genetic and                    
              cellular basis for gravitropism.  The research will broaden the                
              training of the PI into plant genetics, molecular biology and cell             
              biology.
