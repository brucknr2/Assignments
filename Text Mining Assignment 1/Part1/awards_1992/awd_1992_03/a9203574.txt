Abstract    :
              Dr. Cynthia M. Dupureur has been awarded a Postdoctoral                        
              Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr Dupureur's doctoral degree was from                
              Ohio State with Professor Ming-Daw Tsai. She intends to                        
              continue her research at CalTech with Professor Jacqueline                     
              Barton. In Barton's laboratory she will learn many of the                      
              techniques for manipulating DNA and learn about metal ion                      
              interactions with DNA. This will prepare her for her long range                
              career goal of studying metal ion function in endonucleases and                
              designing molecules to interact with DNA for therapeutic                       
              purposes.

              The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as                 
              an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the                   
              knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.'s and attract them into                  
              meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and                       
              teaching.
