Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This research will develop a new computer-based system for                
              improving very short-term prediction of aviation-sensitive weather             
              parameters.  The emphasis on very short term predictions designed              
              to meet the needs of aviation-oriented weather prediction means                
              that the "spin-up" period (often lasting 6-12 hours) that is                   
              characteristic of previous operational numerical models must be                
              virtually eliminated.                                                          
                                                                                             
                   The development of an FDDA procedure will assimilate a variety            
              of conventional and remotely sensed observations into the governing            
              hydrodynamic system of equations of the high-resolution mesoscale              
              numerical model.  This will include both short- and long-term                  
              strategies:  1) developing and testing a suitable procedure for                
              near-term operational implementation based primarily on the widely             
              tested Newtonian relaxation (nudging) technique, and 2) perform                
              basic and developmental research to explore the feasibility of the             
              more advance adjoint technique.                                                
                                                                                             
                   The FDDA procedure, coupled with the mesoscale numerical model            
              and the statistical model, will be combined into a single working              
              system, which will then be tested on real data events and compared             
              to current operational aviation weather-sensitive products.
