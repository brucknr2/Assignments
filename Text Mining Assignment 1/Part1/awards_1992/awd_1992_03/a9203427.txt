Abstract    :
              The transistor that makes the modern                                           
              computer memory possible works as an                                           
              electronic switch.  When there are no                                          
              electrons on the transistor no current can flow                                
              and the transistor is turned off.  When the                                    
              voltage on a gate electrode is increased,                                      
              electrons are added to the transistor and it                                   
              turns on.  In a collaboration between MIT                                      
              and IBM it was recently discovered that very                                   
              small transistors behave in a very unusual way.                                
              In contrast to conventional transistors which                                  
              have only two possible states, either on or off,                               
              a very small transistor turns on and off again                                 
              every time one electron is added to it by the                                  
              gate.  The single-electron behavior has so far                                 
              been observed only at very low temperatures.                                   
              In order to make devices that are potentially                                  
              useful for electronic applications, a much                                     
              higher temperature must be reached.  The                                       
              operating temperature is determined by the                                     
              energy necessary to transfer an electron from                                  
              one of its leads onto the transistor.  The work                                
              proposed will isolate the parameters that                                      
              determine this energy scale, making possible                                   
              single-electron devices operating at practical                                 
              temperatures.  Experiments to test the                                         
              ultimate speed of single-electron transistors                                  
              are also planned.
