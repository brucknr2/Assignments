              Science Program supports collaborative research                                
              in geology to be conducted

              Minnesota, Morris  and by  Dr. A.C. Rocha-                                     
              Campos of the Universidade de Sao Paulo in Sao                                 
              Paulo, Brazil.  The goal of the research is to                                 
              determine the origin of boulder pavements by                                   
              comparative study of examples from the                                         
              Minnesota River Valley in the U.S. and the                                     
              Parana Basin in Brazil.                                                        
                                                                                             
              The project will study boulder pavements from                                  
              the Pleistocene of the Minnesota River Valley                                  
              and the Itarare Subgroup (Late Paleozoic) of                                   
              the Parana Basin in Brazil in order to                                         
              determine the processes which resulted in clast                                
              concentration, emplacement and modification.                                   
              The collaboration expands the knowledge base of                                
              the two groups in a way impossible for either                                  
              group acting alone. The project brings together                                
              the expertise of the U.S. group with recent and                                
              late Pleistocene glacial deposits with the                                     
              Brazilian expertise in sediment and sedimentary                                
              structure analysis.  The U.S. group, situated                                  
              in a predominantly undergraduate setting, will                                 
              expose undergraduates to front-line research.
