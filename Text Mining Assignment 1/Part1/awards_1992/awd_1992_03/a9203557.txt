Abstract    :
              Dr. Patricia Keane has been awarded a Postdoctoral Fellowship                  
              in Chemistry. Dr. Keane's doctoral degree was from Northwestern                
              under the direction of Professor James Ibers. She intends to                   
              continue research at the University of Chicago with Professor                  
              Jeremy Burdett. Her background is in the synthesis of ternary                  
              and quaternary solid state tellurides. She has selected                        
              postdoctoral work with Burdett so that she can learn the                       
              theoretical approaches of electronic band structure                            
              calculations in order to gain a better understanding into                      
              bonding in solids. Her long term goals are the  study of                       
              chemical and electrical modification of Arsenic, Antimony and                  
              Bismuth through intercalation.

              The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as                 
              an important infrastructural program  designed to broaden the                  
              knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.'s and attract them into                  
              meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and                       
              teaching.
