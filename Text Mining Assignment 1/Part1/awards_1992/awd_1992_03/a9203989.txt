Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This two-year study will conduct a comprehensive investigation            
              of the Gorda plate seismicity since 1964, focusing on the larger               
              events that contribute significantly to the seismic strain rate.               
              Source mechanisms, depths, seismic movement and other details of               
              the rupture events will be determined using waveform inversion                 
              techniques.  Relocation of all events with mb >=5 will be used to              
              produce precise locations of the intraplate events that can be                 
              compared to geological observations, such as GLORIA side-scan                  
              imagery.
