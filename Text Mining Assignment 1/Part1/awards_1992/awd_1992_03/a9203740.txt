              Description:  This proposal is for group travel                                
              to a small binational workshop on: "Galaxy                                     
              Distribution Functions" to be held at the                                      
              Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and                                      
              Astrophysics(IUCAA), Pune, December 1992.                                      
              Professors S.M. Chitre, of the Tata Institute                                  
              of Fundamental Research in Bombay and W. Saslaw                                
              of the University of Virginia are the principal                                
              organizers.  Galaxy distribution functions are                                 
              important for understanding the large scale                                    
              structure of matter in the Universe.  Gravity                                  
              is a primary influence on this distribution but                                
              despite its long history, the mutual                                           
              interaction of large numbers of gravitating                                    
              objects is a difficult problem and progress in                                 
              areas relevant to galaxy clustering is very                                    
              recent.  Progress has resulted from a                                          
              combination of analytic physical theory,                                       
              computer N-body simulation, and astronomical                                   
              observations.  These problems, along with                                      
              closely related areas of physics and related                                   
              statistical descriptions, will be the main                                     
              topics of the workshop.                                                        
                                                                                             
              Scope:  Principal objectives of the workshop                                   
              are to review recent results related to galaxy                                 
              distribution functions and to coordinate future                                
              collaborations between Indian and Western                                      
              astrophysicists studying large scale structure                                 
              of the Universe. There has been considerable                                   
              research activity in this field and increasing                                 
              interest among Indian astronomers resident                                     
              abroad in observing and analyzing galaxy                                       
              distributions. Exposure of the Indian                                          
              scientists and students to recent developments                                 
              will be significant for the course of research                                 
              on extra-galactic physics in India.  The                                       
              workshop is particularly timely since it will                                  
              soon be possible to obtain observational data                                  
              from the new Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope                                   
              under construction near Pune.
