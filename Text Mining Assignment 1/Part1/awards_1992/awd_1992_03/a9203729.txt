Abstract    :
              Range arithmetic is a computer arithmetic more advanced than ordinary          
              floating-point arithmetic.  It permits many numerical problems to be           
              solved in such a way that answers are obtained correct to a prescribed         
              number of decimal places.  Range arithmetic is presently available as a        
              set of code files that enable a user to compose programs in the C++            
              language.  This research is for continuing the development and                 
              propagation of these files, and for investigating whether certain              
              problems requiring extensive computation , especially problems of              
              partial differential equations, can be solved precisely with range             
              arithmetic.  Also, the possibility of providing range arithmetic in            
              another form, more suitable for such extensive problems, will be               
              investigated.
