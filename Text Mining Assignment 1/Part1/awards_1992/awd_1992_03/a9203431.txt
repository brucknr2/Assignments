Abstract    :
              This is a group travel grant award for U.S. Participation in the               
              IEEE International Conference of Robotics and Automation (ICRA)                
              to be held in NICE, France during the period of May 11-15, 1992.               
              traditionally held in the U.S., it has become the largest annual               
              conference in the field with more than 20 countries                            
              participating.  This will be the first time that it has been held              
              outside of the U.S. and it is important that the U.S. remain                   
              prominent in this activity.  A competitive procedure will be used              
              to select 48 U.S. participants for partial airfare
