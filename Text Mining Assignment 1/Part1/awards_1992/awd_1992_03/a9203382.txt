Abstract    :
                   The principal investigators will continue their                           
              investigation of a broad range of problems in differential                     
              geometry and global analysis. The problems will focus on the                   
              relationship between geometric invariants and topological                      
              invariants. In particular they will study knots and linking,                   
              structures on four manifolds, quantum groups, and Chern-Simons                 
              path integrals.                                                                
                   This award will support research in the general area of                   
              differential geometry and global analysis. Differential geometry               
              is the study of the relationship between the geometry of a space               
              and analytic concepts defined on the space. Global analysis is                 
              the study of the overall geometric and topological properties of               
              a space by piecing together local information. Applications of                 
              these areas of mathematics in other sciences include the                       
              structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas boundaries, and                 
              the large scale structure of the universe.
