Abstract    :
              Dr. Christopher M. Hadad has been awarded a Postdoctoral                       
              Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Hadad's doctoral degree was from                  
              Yale with Professor Kenneth Wiberg. Dr. Hadad intends to                       
              continue his research with Professor Charles DePuy at the                      
              University of Colorado. He will learn the techniques of                        
              studying reactions by the flowing afterglow method and                         
              strengthen his understanding of theoretical as well as                         
              experimental approaches to the elucidation of gas phase                        
              mechanistic studies. This will help him in his career goal of                  
              studying how condensed media affects chemical reaction dynamics.

              The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as                 
              an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the                   
              knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.'s and attract them into                  
              meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and                       
              teaching.
