Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This U.S.-Venezuela award will support Dr. Lee                                 
              Hartmann and Dr. Scott Kenyon of the Smithsonian                               
              Institution Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge                             
              Massachusetts, in a research collaboration with Dr.                            
              Nuria Calvet of the Centro de Investigaciones de                               
              Astronomia in Merida, Venezuela.  The purpose of the                           
              research is to carry out theoretical and                                       
              observational investigations of the acceleration of                            
              jets from young stars.  These jets or focussed winds                           
              emanate from the accretion disks that surround the                             
              youngest stars and are an important component of the                           
              energy budget of star formation.                                               
                                                                                             
              The proposed joint effort takes advantage of the                               
              observational capabilities of the U.S. investigators                           
              and the theoretical experience of the Venezuelan                               
              researcher in radiative transfer models for                                    
              protostellar accretion disks and winds.  The result                            
              will be the development of models for the                                      
              acceleration of protostellar disk winds and jets                               
              which are consistent with, and supported by                                    
              observations.  This research may have implications                             
              for theories of accretion disk winds for many other                            
              astrophysical systems, such as cataclysmic variables                           
              and active galactic nuclei.
