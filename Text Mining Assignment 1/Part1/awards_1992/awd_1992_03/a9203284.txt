Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Walla Walla College is establishing a connection to NSFNET via a               
              56,000 bits per second line through the NorthWestNet mid-level                 
              network.  The connection enables the school's faculty and students             
              to communicate and collaborate with the national scientific and                
              educational community, and to access network resources.  Areas of              
              science to be addressed on the Internet by Walla Walla College                 
              include physics, computer science, engineering and chemistry.  The             
              library also expects to benefit from the connection.  This award               
              funds part of the costs for two years.***
