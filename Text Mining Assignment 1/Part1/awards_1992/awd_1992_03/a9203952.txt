Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to use 234Th data to quantify the                  
              particulate flux of organic C and N at the base of the euphotic                
              zone in the equatorial Pacific.  Measurements of 234Th: 238U                   
              disequilibria in the spring and fall of 1992 will be used to                   
              quantify the particulate 234Th flux in north to south transects                
              across the equator between 170 degrees W to 110 degrees W.  The                
              flux data will be combined with measurements of organic C/234Th and            
              N/234Th ratios on size-fractionated particulate matter, to                     
              calculate the particulate flux of organic C and N.  By taking                  
              advantage of shipboard gamma spectrometric analyses of 234Th, the              
              flux data will be available in close-to-real time.  Using an in-               
              situ pumping system, all samples will be collected independent of              
              other sampling activities.  With this data set the equatorial                  
              Pacific's role in the global C budget for the removal of C and                 
              associated nutrients to the ocean's interior (new production) will             
              be able to be quantified.  In addition, the seasonal and spatial               
              coverage will allow the extent to which new production is being                
              exported as DOM rather than settling particles to be resolved, and             
              the processes responsible for determining the efficiency of C                  
              export vs. recycling in the upper oceans will be better understood.
