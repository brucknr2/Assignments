Abstract    :
              Emergent macrophytic halophytes from salt marshes of the Atlantic              
              coast of the U.S.A. will be surveyed throughout the year for                   
              epiphytic fungi.  Specimens will be cultured and examined using                
              both light and electron microscopy.  Collections will be                       
              accessioned in the Institute of Marine Sciences (IMS) Herbarium                
              (University of North Carolina).  Isolates will be deposited at the             
              American Type Culture Collection.  Specimen data will be entered in            
              an already established database at IMS.  A species list will be                
              published.
