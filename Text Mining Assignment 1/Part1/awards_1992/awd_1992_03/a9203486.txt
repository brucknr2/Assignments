Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project supports the dissertation research of a graduate                  
              student in anthropology, studying the process of national                      
              identity formation among Bulgarian Turkish citizens who have                   
              recently emigrated from Bulgaria to Turkey and are being                       
              assimilated as national Turks.  The student will reside in a                   
              medium sized city where many Bulgarian Turks have settled.                     
              Using ethnographic methods of participant observation and                      
              structured interviews as well as archival research, the student                
              will study how the national state has attempted to define the                  
              "official" Turkish national identity, and how Bulgarian Turks                  
              have responded.  The main question is how peoples of different,                
              but historically related ethnicities interact to establish                     
              relations of dominance or equality.                                            
                                                                                             
              This research is timely and important as the world sees the                    
              intensity rising of ethnic conflict in Eastern Europe.                         
              Understanding general processes of ethnic relations through                    
              careful case studies can help us comprehend how states attempt to              
              establish ethnic dominance, and how subject peoples maintain                   
              their own precious ethnic independence.
