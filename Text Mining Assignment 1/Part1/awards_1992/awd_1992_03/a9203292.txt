Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              Cyclic di- and tri-sulfides bearing the carbon skeleton of phytol,             
              the C20 isoprenoidal alcohol side chain of chlorophyll a, have                 
              recently been recovered from the organic extracts of various marine            
              sediments.  This finding and related others imply that labile                  
              biomarkers undergo reaction with reduced forms of sulfur such as               
              polysulfide during early diagenetic processes in recent sediments.             
              Few studies to date have examined the recent sediment record                   
              systematically to retrieve more specific details of this                       
              geochemical phenomenon and to assess the importance of sulfur                  
              "quenching" as a viable mechanism of preservation for labile                   
              biomarkers.  A multidisciplinary geochemical approach will be used             
              to explore this problem intensively.  The overall goal of the                  
              research is to develop a reliable method of extracting quantitative            
              biomarker information from the sedimentary component of total                  
              organic carbon that is diagenetically modified by reactions with               
              sulfur.  Such information when complemented with biomarker data                
              obtained from sediments by more conventional methods might prove               
              invaluable to paleoceanographic research.
