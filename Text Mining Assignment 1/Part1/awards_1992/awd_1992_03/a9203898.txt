Abstract    :
                   The proposed work is for the design and fabrication of an                 
              exhibit called "Electric Space: Our Sun-Earth Environment" to be               
              placed near the Planetarium in the National Air and Space Museum.              
              Another exhibit is planned in years 2 and 3 of this project which              
              will travel to science and technology centers throughout the                   
              United States.  The goal is to bring to exhibit viewer to a                    
              better understanding of space science as a                                     
              comprehensive,interdisciplinary and exciting field of science.                 
              School children and the general public alike will be invited to                
              experience space science as an approachable, creative activity                 
              through illustrating various facets of solar-terrestrial science               
              in scientifically sound yet captivating materials, including                   
              interactive media. The overarching theme of the exhibits will be               
              to clearly show the importance of the sun and its impact on our                
              near-Earth environment.  Secondary themes emphasize that space is              
              not empty and can be very hazardous to people and technological                
              systems; and that the entire geospace environment is highly                    
              coupled and interconnected.  Thus, these exhibits will focus on                
              processes rather than just facts.
