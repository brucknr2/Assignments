Abstract    :
                    This award supports research in commutative algebra and                  
              ring theory.  One of the principal investigators will work on                  
              the integral representation of Gl(n).  The other principal                     
              investigator will work on the representation theory of artin                   
              algebras and theory of lattices over higher dimensional orders,                
              with special emphasis on maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules over                   
              isolated Cohen-Macaulay singularities.                                         
                   This research is in the general area of ring theory.                      
              A ring is an algebraic object having both an addition and a                    
              multiplication defined on it.  Although the additive operation                 
              satisfies the commutative law, the multiplicative operation                    
              is not required to do so.  An example of a ring for which                      
              multiplication is not commutative is the collection of nxn                     
              matrices over the integers.  The study of noncommutative rings                 
              has become an important part of algebra because of its increasing              
              significance to other branches of mathematics and physics.
