Abstract    :
                   This project addresses the theory and application of                      
              smoothing methods in nonparametric curve estimation. The focus                 
              here is on bandwidth selection with exact risk calculation and                 
              qualitative smoothing and on an examination of the superiority of              
              local polynomial smoothers to more commonly used methods.  For                 
              local polynomial smoothers, this project will address issues of                
              boundary effects, percentile regression and robustification,                   
              variable order of fit, goodness-of-fit testing and local weighted              
              likelihood.                                                                    
                   Smoothing methods in nonparametric curve estimation                       
              constitute a flexible and powerful approach to data analysis                   
              which is of particular use in complicated situations where an                  
              exact or even useful model is unavailable.  Such problems arise,               
              for example, in economics, zoology, and marketing among other                  
              areas.Effective practical implementation of smoothing methods                  
              requires analytic understanding of their properties.
