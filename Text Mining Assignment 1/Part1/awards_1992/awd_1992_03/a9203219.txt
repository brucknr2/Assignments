Abstract    :
              The development of new molecular genetic and statistical                       
              techniques provides the opportunity to identify the number and                 
              genomic position of quantitative trait loci (QTL's) through                    
              linkage associations of variable molecular markers.  These new                 
              techniques  will be applied to a hybridization study of two                    
              species of crickets in the genus Laupala: L.paranigra and                      
              L.kohalaensis.  These species posess an extremely simple                       
              acoustical communication system.  Phenotypic variation in female               
              phonotaxis will be associated to specific QTL's in a hybrid                    
              backcross design.  These results will be compared to those                     
              obtained from another study on the male calling song in order to               
              test competing models of genetic architecture of character                     
              covariation.
