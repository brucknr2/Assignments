Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will help the Departments of Chemistry at Brown University and                 
              the University of Rhode Island acquire, maintain and operate a                 
              workstation network.  The areas of chemical research that will                 
              be enhanced by the acquisition include:                                        
                                                                                             
              1.  The Quantum Mechanics of Surface Adsorbates.                               
                                                                                             
              2.  The Atomic Geometry of Solid Surfaces.                                     
                                                                                             
              3.  The Equilibrium and Dynamical Properties of Atomic and                     
                   Molecular Clusters.                                                       
                                                                                             
              4.  The Formation and Decay of Clusters.                                       
                                                                                             
              5.  Elementary Excitations in Liquids.                                         
                                                                                             
              6.  Quantum Monte Carlo Algorithums.                                           
                                                                                             
              Chemists carrying out frontier research are relying more and                   
              more on computers that are capable of handling sophisticated                   
              simulations, data analysis and graphics software.  The need to                 
              accomodate multiple users on the single laboratory computer and                
              multiple users on a single chemistry department facility can be                
              met by a single solution:  individual workstations for the                     
              majority of user needs and, for the remainder, ready access to                 
              other types of workstations and, ultimately, to a mini                         
              supercomputer
