Abstract    :
              With prior NSF support, Hatcher and Quinn have demonstrated that               
              data-parallel SIMD programs can be complied into code that executes            
              efficiently on both shared-memory and distributed-memory MIMD                  
              computers.  In this project they develop new compliation strategies            
              that will enable data-parallel programs to execute efficiently on              
              future-generation multicomputers, including the Touchstone Sigma.              
              The starting point of this work is the new C* language developed               
              by Thinking Machines Corporation.  Hatcher and Quinn extend the                
              language to provide a machine-independent means for specifying the             
              distribution of data among the physical processors' memories and               
              to facilitate parallel I/O.
