Abstract    :
                   This research addresses a new solder application method,                  
              using ink-jet printing technology, to produce and place molten                 
              solder droplets onto various substrates.  Ink-jet based solder                 
              deposition would be low cost (no masks or screens are required),               
              flexible (the image is stored and formed digitally), suitable for              
              manufacturing environment (does not operate in a vacuum like                   
              liquid metal ion systems), highly repeatable, and high                         
              resolution.  Specific applications would include formation of                  
              solder bumps on integrated circuits for TAB or flip-chip                       
              interconnection, or selective application of top metallization                 
              for fine pitch surface mount assembly, chip-on-board (COB), or                 
              multichip modules (MCM's).  Direct-write solder technology would               
              be ideal for rework, including both chip or package replacement,               
              and metallization or personalization of circuitry for high                     
              density interconnection (HDI) substrates.
