Abstract    :
                   This award provides support for postdoctoral research on                  
              problems arising in the general area of geometric function                     
              theory.  The work focuses on the geometric properties of                       
              quasiextremal distance domains.  These are domains characterized               
              by the property that points and closed sets can be joined by                   
              curves within the domain whose lengths do not be arbitrarily                   
              long.  They are singled out because they have the characteristics              
              believed to be fundamental for the study of quasiconformal                     
              mappings.  Work on this project will concentrate on showing how                
              the modulus of quasiextremal distance domains carries over to the              
              dilatation constant for quasiconformal mapping defined on them.                
              A second line of research will consider the length of level sets               
              of univalent mappings and the question of the largest power to                 
              which such a mapping's derivative has a finite integral.                       
                   Complex function theory encompasses the study of                          
              differentiable functions of a complex variable and related                     
              classes of functions such as harmonic functions and                            
              quasiconformal mappings.  The subject is highly geometric; many                
              of the problems concern the properties of various sets under                   
              transform by functions from one of the above classes.                          
              Applications of the theory to potential theory and fluid dynamics              
              is now standard in engineering circles
