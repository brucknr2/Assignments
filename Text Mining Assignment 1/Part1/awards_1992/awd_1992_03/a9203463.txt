Abstract    :
                   Because insects have exoskeletons, they must molt in order                
              to increase in the size.  There are dramatic ontogenetic                       
              fluctuations in grasshopper jumping ability as animals molt and                
              reproduce.  Insects that walk or run may also experience molt                  
              related changes in locomotor performance.  This study will                     
              investigate how the kinetics, kinematics, and energetics of                    
              locomotion change over ontogeny in the cockroach Blaberus                      
              discoidalis.  These changes will be related to the effect of the               
              molt cycle on properties of the muscle and cuticle, and computer               
              models and simulations will be used to explore how alterations in              
              the rates of such developmental changes could affect the dynamics              
              of ontogenetic locomotor performance.  This work will therefore                
              integrate physiology, the material properties of skeletal                      
              elements, and the locomotor performance of intact animals to                   
              provide tests of the functional importance of musculoskeletal                  
              design and provide data on how locomotion is affected by the molt              
              cycle.  This will represent the first such data ever collected on              
              any pedestrian arthropod.
