Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award from the U.S.-Argentina Cooperative                                 
              Science Program supports research in mathematics                               
              to be conducted by Dr. Jim Douglas, Jr. of                                     
              Purdue University and Dr. Juan E. Santos of the                                
              University of La Plata, Argentina.  The goal of                                
              the project is to continue development of a                                    
              parallelizable technique for approximating waves                               
              in composite media with one outcome being                                      
              mathematically-justified parallel algorithms.                                  
                                                                                             
              The project continues an active collaboration                                  
              between two well-regarded researchers.  The                                    
              project focuses on the development of an                                       
              efficient, parallelizable technique for                                        
              approximating waves in a composite medium                                      
              consisting in part of a fluid region and in part                               
              of a fluid-saturated elastic region; a problem                                 
              that arises in the simulation of acoustic well-                                
              logging.  The numerical methods to be studied                                  
              relate to space-frequency descriptions of the                                  
              waves in place of the more common space-time                                   
              descriptions.  The research is to be divided                                   
              almost evenly between the Purdue and La Plata                                  
              groups, with a major part of the experimental                                  
              calculations carried out by the former.  ***
