Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is for continued study of submarine lava samples and              
              geophysical data collected from the Galapagos platform in 1990.                
              Geochemical studies confirm and extend a horseshoe-shaped pattern              
              of geochemical zonation in the zonation in the subaerial and                   
              submarine eruptive products of the Galapagos hotspot.  The                     
              principal investigators are presently collecting major and trace               
              element concentrations, isotopic ratios, and radiomatic age data               
              from an extensive suite of submarine volcanic rocks and glasses in             
              order to test these hypotheses.
