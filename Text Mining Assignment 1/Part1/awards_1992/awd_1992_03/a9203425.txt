Abstract    :
                   This proposal is for partial support of the twelfth                       
              conference in a series whose purpose is a review of the latest                 
              experimental measurements in elementary particle physics at                    
              the highest energies.  The conference format is a single                       
              plenary session of 40 minute review talks, and has particular                  
              pedagogic value for student and junior postdoctoral attendees                  
              as well as others.  New results on electron-antielectron                       
              collisions from SLAC, LEP and Cornell should be reviewed.                      
              Also, considerable interest will focus on new experimental                     
              results from the proton-antiproton colliders at Fermilab and                   
              CERN and from new electron proton collider at HERA.  Data from                 
              the other experiments in which various projectile collisions                   
              with a variety of nuclear targets have recently been completed                 
              at Fermilab are likely to be available in preliminary form.
