              17-22,                                                                         
              1992, to present a paper entitled, "Effect of Combined                         
              Adsorption                                                                     
              and Adsorption in Migration of Soil Contaminants."  This paper                 
                                                                                             
              proposes a novel approach to understand and analyze                            
              quantitatively                                                                 
              the movement of soil contaminants in partially-wet soils.                      
              While                                                                          
              in southern Japan the Principal Investigator will also visit                   
              research colleagues at Yamaguchi University, Kumamoto                          
              University, and University of Tokushima to discuss                             
              adsorption-desorption processes that apply to environmental                    
              and separations engineering.  A report of this trip will be                    
              submitted to the Interfacial, Transport and Separation                         
              Processes Program of the National Science Foundation.
