Abstract    :
              This is the first year of a postdoctoral fellowship award to                   
              Dr. Michael Raftery. Dr. Raftery received his Ph.D. for work                   
              with Alexander Pines at Berkeley. He will be working with Robin                
              Hochstrasser at Pennsylvania in order to learn about the                       
              application of ultrafast infrared laser spectroscopy to the                    
              study of energy transfer at the surface of adsorbates on metals                
              and semiconductor nanoclusters. This represents a new direction                
              for which Dr Raftery is well-prepared from his graduate studies                
              applying NMR to motions at surfaces.

              This is the first year of a postdoctoral fellowship award to                   
              Dr. Michael Raftery. He will be studying basic properties of                   
              adsorbates. These materials have the potential of improving the                
              quality and performance of electrical circuits and could have a                
              wide range of applications to the miniaturization of                           
              electronics.
