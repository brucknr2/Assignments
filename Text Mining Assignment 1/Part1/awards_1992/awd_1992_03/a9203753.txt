Abstract    :
                   Schlumprecht will continue his study of the structure theory              
              and local theory of Banach spaces, and specifically, the                       
              distortion problem.  Schlumprecht's recent work in this area                   
              contributed significantly to the solutions of several long                     
              standing problems, including the unconditional basis problem, the              
              hyperplane problem, and the prime Banach space problem, and                    
              additional results in these and related areas will be pursued.                 
                   Banach space theory is that part of mathematics that                      
              attempts to generalize to infinitely many dimensions the                       
              structure of 3-dimensional Euclidean (i.e.ordinary) space.  The                
              axioms for the distance function in a Banach space are more                    
              relaxed than those for Euclidean distance (For example, the                    
              "parallelogram law" is not required to hold.), and as a result,                
              the "geometry" of a Banach space can be quite exotic.  Much of                 
              the research in this area concerns studying the structure theory               
              of Banach spaces.
