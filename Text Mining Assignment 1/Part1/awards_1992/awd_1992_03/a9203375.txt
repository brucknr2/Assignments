Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will investigate the actions of                
              Hopf algebras on rings, in particular crossed products and inner               
              actions.  The object is to extend earlier results for actions of               
              groups as automorphisms and of Lie algebras as derivations.                    
              Other problems concern when the Weyl algebra can be a fixed ring,              
              and studying the coalgebra structure of the quantum enveloping                 
              algebras.  The postdoctoral associate will work on quantum groups              
              and quasitriangular Hopf algebras.  She will also consider                     
              general Hopf algebras and their actions on H-module algebras.                  
                   This research is in the general area of ring theory.  A ring              
              is an algebraic object having both an addition and a multiplica-               
              tion defined on it.  Although the additive operation satisfies                 
              the commutative law, the multiplicative operation is not required              
              to do so.  An example of a ring for which multiplication is not                
              commutative is the collection of nxn matrices over the integers.               
              The study of noncommutative rings has become an important part of              
              algebra because of its increasing significance to other branches               
              of mathematics and physics.
