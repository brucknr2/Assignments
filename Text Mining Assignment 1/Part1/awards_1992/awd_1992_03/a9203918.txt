Abstract    :
              A series of high spin polyradical molecules with distinct                      
              three-dimensional shapes will be synthesized and characterized.                
              The polyradical shapes will be imposed by either steric                        
              hindrance (dendrimers) or covalent bond networks (cages).                      
              Magnetic analysis will be accomplished by utilizing SQUID, NMR,                
              and ESR techniques.  Molecular solids comprised of high spin                   
              polyradicals will be developed and investigated, and the                       
              feasibility of making ultra high spin polyradicals will be                     
              demonstrated.  The investigation will provide a general model                  
              for electron spin ordering as a function of distance and number                
              of unpaired electrons.

              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work                 
              of Professor Andrzej Rajca at the University of Nebraska on the                
              synthesis and characterization of high spin organic molecules                  
              that possess several unpaired electrons. Electrons in typical                  
              organic molecules are paired and thus have no magnetic                         
              properties, whereas the target molecules will be prototype                     
              building blocks for novel organic magnets.  This investigation                 
              should provide basic information required to produce magnets on                
              a molecular level for a variety of technical and scientific                    
              applications impacting on the electronics and communications                   
              fields.
