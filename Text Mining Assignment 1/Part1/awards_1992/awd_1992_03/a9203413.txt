Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will study a variety of problems               
              concerning the qualitative properties of the solutions of partial              
              differential equations which describe nonlinear wave motion.  In               
              particular, analytic justification of asymptotic methods for                   
              nonlinear waves arising in geometric optics will be sought and                 
              questions concerning the controllability of hyperbolic waves will              
              be studied.                                                                    
                   The qualitative analysis of nonlinear waves is of                         
              significant scientific interest in view of their wide spread                   
              occurence in real world situations.
