              Long and Medium-Term Research:  Studies on the Active Site of                  
              the Unique Aspartate Transcarbamoylase from the Soil Bacterium,                
              Pseudomonas Aeruginosa                                                         
                                                                                             
              This award is under the Long and Medium-Term Research at                       
              Foreign Centers of Excellence Program, which enables U.S.                      
              scientists and engineers to conduct three to twelve months of                  
              research abroad at research centers of proven excellence.  The                 
              program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the             
              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and                       
              experimental conditions abroad.                                                
                                                                                             
              This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research visit             
              by Dr. John F. Vickrey of the University of North Texas to work                
              with Dr. Guy Herve at the Centre National de la Recherche                      
              Scientifique (CNRS).                                                           
                                                                                             
              Aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATcase, EC 2.1.3.2) is a pivotal                  
              enzyme in the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway.  In Escherichia                 
              coli, this regulatory polypeptide has the unique architecture which            
              allows the enzyme to demonstrate allosteric response to the end                
              products CTP and the parallel pathway ATP.  This enzyme in                     
              prokaryotes has been divided into three classes, which are based               
              upon regulatory response, subunit design and molecular weight.                 
              Until recently, the Pseudomonads were believed to contain the                  
              Class A ATCase which is the largest molecular weight enzyme                    
              (Mr360,000) and is composed of two tentative identical subunits.               
              This project involves identifying the amino acid residues essential            
              to the constitution of the catalytic center in this unique ATCase              
              from P. aeruginosa.                                                            
                                                                                             
              The award recommendation provides funds to cover international                 
              travel and a stipend for twelve months.
