Abstract    :
              Dr. Robert J. Hinde has been awarded a Postdoctoral Fellowship                 
              in Chemistry. Dr. Hinde's doctoral degree was from The                         
              University of Chicago with Professor Stephen Berry. Dr. Hinde                  
              intends to continue his research with Professor Gregory Ezra at                
              Cornell University.  Dr. Hinde's postdoctoral research will be                 
              an investigation into questions of phase space transport and                   
              trapping in chemically interesting multimode Hamiltonian                       
              systems. This will help prepare him for his career goal of                     
              establishing an active research program focussing on                           
              intramolecular energy flow and the quantum mechanical behavior                 
              of chaotic dynamical systems.                                                  
              %%%                                                                            
              The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as                 
              an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the                   
              knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.'s and attract them into                  
              meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and                       
              teaching.
