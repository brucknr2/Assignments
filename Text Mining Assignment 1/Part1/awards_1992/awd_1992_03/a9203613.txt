Abstract    :
              Dr. Eileen M. Spain has been awarded a Postdoctoral Fellowship                 
              in Chemistry. Dr. Spain's doctoral degree was from Utah                        
              University under the supervision of Professor Michael Morse.                   
              She intends to continue her research with Professor Stephen                    
              Leone at The University of Colorado. Dr. Spain's career goal is                
              to study electronic orbital alignment effects in the tranistion                
              metal bond activation of small molecules such as hydrogen,                     
              oxygen, and methane. As a graduate student she studied the                     
              electronic structure of metal-metal bonds. In her postdoctoral                 
              work she will develop experiments using orbital alignment                      
              effects on chemical reactions.                                                 
              %%%                                                                            
              The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as                 
              an important infrastructural progam designed to broaden the                    
              knowledge and experience of new Ph.D's and attract them into                   
              meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and                       
              teaching.
