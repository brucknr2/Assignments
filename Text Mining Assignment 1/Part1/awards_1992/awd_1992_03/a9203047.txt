Abstract    :
              The project will examine the predictive value of dynamic failure               
              computations when progressive degradation of the structural                    
              properties takes place due to elastic damage and softening.                    
              Dynamic stability predictions require on one hand robust solution              
              strategies which survive material instabilities in the small                   
              region when localized failure mechanisms remain confined.  On the              
              other hand, the underlying mathematical model and its                          
              computational implementation must be sufficiently sensitive to                 
              capture progressive failure and to control its propagation in a                
              realistic manner.  To this end, different failure indicators will              
              be implemented for tracing dynamic instabilities and for                       
              monitoring dynamic failure calculations within explicit and                    
              implicit solution strategies.                                                  
                                                                                             
              The principal objective is the development of an adaptive solution             
              method based on Lyapunov stability indicators which capture                    
              bifurcations both in the space and in the time domain. The novel               
              methodology will be illustrated with realistic structural problems             
              which exhibit degrading stiffness and strength properties due to               
              damage and softening behavior on the material level.
