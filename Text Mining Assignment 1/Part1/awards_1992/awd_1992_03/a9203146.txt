Abstract    :
              This research will focus on the development of synthetic                       
              methodology for preparing the indole ring system.  This will be                
              accomplished by use of an intramolecular ?2+2! cycloaddition                   
              reaction of arylamino ketenes containing a pendant alkene, to                  
              form fused indoline cyclobutanones.

              With this Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) award,                  
              the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr.                
              Bjorn C. Soderberg of the Department Chemistry at the                          
              University of South Alabama.  The project will not only provide                
              new methodology for synthesizing an important class of organic                 
              compounds, but will also provide excellent opportunities for                   
              research by undergraduates.
