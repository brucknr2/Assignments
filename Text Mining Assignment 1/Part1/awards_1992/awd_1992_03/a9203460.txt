Abstract    :
              This proposal outlined a combined theoretical and experimental                 
              program of atomic-scale studies of ferroelectric ceramic materials,            
              such as lead zirconium titanate (PZT) and tin-doped compounds                  
              (PSZT). 17O NMR/NQR measurements will determine electric field                 
              gradients as a microscopic probe of the local electronic structure.            
              Electronic structure calculations in the framework of Local Density            
              theory will be used to help interpret these measurements.  The                 
              influence of doping on the ferroelectric to antiferroelectric                  
              transition will be investigated.                                               
              %%%%                                                                           
              This proposal combines the theoretical and experiemtnal studies to             
              investigate the effect of doping on ferroelectrics such as PZT and             
              PSZT.  Local electronic structure will be carefully studied.                   
              Electric field gradients as measured from NMR/NQR measurements will            
              be interpreted with the help of calculations from the Local Desity             
              theory.
