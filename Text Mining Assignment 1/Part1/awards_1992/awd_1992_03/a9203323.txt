Abstract    :
              This project is for the upgrade and acquisition of control                     
              electronics for a scanning Auger microprobe and X-ray photoelectron            
              spectrometer that was donated to the university.  This will have               
              a beneficial effect on several different research groups at the                
              university and allow many others to benefit from the facility.                 
              Examples of research projects that will make use of this instrument            
              are investigations of ferroelectric films, mechanical studies of               
              structural ceramics, analysis of Si-SiO2-metal device structures,              
              investigations into plasma etching, electronic materials studies               
              examining high-Tc superconducting thin film and bulk materials.
