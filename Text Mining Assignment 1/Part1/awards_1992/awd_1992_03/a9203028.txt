Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The goal of this research is to develop and test methods for              
              inferring particle energy input to the earth's atmosphere using                
              optical and radar detection systems, and to study the atmospheric              
              changes caused by these fluxes.  The PI will use the latest                    
              prognostic and climatological models of upper atmosphere density               
              and composition. Auroral model results will be made available to               
              the aeronomy community.
