Abstract    :
                   This grant supports basic theoretical research in the                     
              area of non-linear dynamics and stochastic processes.  The                     
              main focus of the work will be to study the chaotic                            
              amplification of intrinsic noise in quantum systems using                      
              analytical as well as improved numerical techniques.
