Abstract    :
                   The project requests fund to participation of 30 minority                 
              faculty to attend the ACM Computer Science Conference and the ACM              
              SIGCSE Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education which run             
              consecutively at the same site.  This is an extremely worthwhile               
              endeavor as reported by the past years participants.  It is                    
              essential that minority faculty become exposed to the research                 
              culture which is effectively presented at conferences such as                  
              these.  Among the planned activities are (1) special sessions                  
              addressing unique programs for minorities, (2) panels addressing               
              funding opportunities for minority research programs, (3) an                   
              employment register, (4) student activities featuring minorities,              
              and (5) a special session in the chair's program dealing with                  
              administering a computer science program at a minority institution.            
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
              The funding will support attendance by approximately 25 minority               
              faculty at the ACM CSC 92, the SIGCSE 92 in Kansas City, March 3 -             
              7, and one workshop to enhance their skills.  It is important that             
              minority faculty attend national conferences in order to become                
              better integrated into the research and education communities.                 
              This project represents a strong effort in that directions.//
