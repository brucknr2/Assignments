Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The subsurface chlorophyll maximum (SCM) is one the most widely                
              recognized biological features in the ocean, however, a mechanistic            
              understanding of the dynamics processes leading to its formation               
              and maintenance has not been fully accepted.  Under the common                 
              assumption that marine grazers are food-limited and that                       
              phytoplankton in the SCM are light-limited, one simple question has            
              remained particularly puzzling - why isn't the SCM grazed away?                
              Based on new results, we hypothesize that 1) growth and loss                   
              processes are not uniform among the algal taxa represented in the              
              SCM, 2) some algal groups, small unicellular algae, are indeed                 
              better adapted to the low light conditions of the SCM than other               
              algal taxa and 3) functional feeding responses of resident                     
              micrograzers operate to maintain the SCM as a persistent feature.              
              The project initiates new taxon-specific experiments that focus on             
              the dynamics of phytoplankton growth, herbivorous grazing and cell             
              sinking in the SCM.  Taxon-specific rates will be determined from              
              corroborative methods which exploit algal pigments as                          
              chemotaxonomic markers.  Our goal is to develop a taxon-specific               
              understanding of rate processes that control the formation and                 
              maintenance of the oceanic SCM.
