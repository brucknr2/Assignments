Abstract    :
              A fundamental question in the silicon-                                         
              germanium heterostructure field is the                                         
              possibility of strong electrically-pumped light                                
              emission for light-emitting devices.  Based on                                 
              promising initial results, we propose to use the                               
              Rapid Thermal Chemical Vapor Deposition                                        
              (RTCVD) growth technique to develop novel                                      
              quantum material structures to increase the                                    
              light-emission intensities in the silicon-                                     
              germanium system.  This RTCVD technique                                        
              at Princeton has already demonstrated the first                                
              well-resolved bandedge light-emission from                                     
              strained Si1-xGex quantum wells and                                            
              superlattices, and also the first 1.3-um room-                                 
              temperature electro-luminescence (LED's) in                                    
              the Si1-xGex system.                                                           
                                                                                             
              It is proposed to increase the quantum                                         
              efficiencies of these initial results by                                       
              examining the properties of carriers in ultra-                                 
              thin quantum wells (< = 1 nm) and                                              
              monolayer-scale superlattices grown by                                         
              chemical vapor deposition (CVD).  This work                                    
              will focus on the growth and opto-electronic                                   
              characterization  of such structures, which                                    
              have not previously been grown by CVD.                                         
              Such growth will require an understanding of                                   
              the initial stages of heteroepitaxy in column                                  
              IV CVD, which will be studied through the                                      
              use of Auger electron spectroscopy in the                                      
              rapid thermal CVD reactor at Princeton.  The                                   
              ultimate goal will be a self-limiting atomic                                   
              layer epitaxy process.
