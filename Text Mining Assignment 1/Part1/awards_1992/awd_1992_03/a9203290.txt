Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This project will deploy the upgraded Aerospace CCD camera at             
              the University of Illinois to make measurements of the temperature             
              and intensity of the OH Meinel (6,2) band and O2 Atmospheric (0,1)             
              emissions.  Concurrently, the University of Western Ontario Fourier            
              Tranform spectrometer will make the same measurements.  This data              
              will then be used to cross-calibrate the various measurement                   
              techniques.  Further, the Aerospace CCD camera will explore the                
              effects of gravity waves on the upper mesosphere over Maui, Hawaii,            
              and make more measurements during the ALOHA-93 campaign in the fall            
              of 1993.
