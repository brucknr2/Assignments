Abstract    :
                    Combining techniques from disparate areas (Algebra,                      
              Geometry,and Combinatorics) the investigator and his coworkers                 
              recently determined the generic dimension of trivariate spline                 
              spaces (of sufficiently high degree) defined on tetrahedral                    
              decompositions.                                                                
                   In this project the techniques will be further developed and              
              applied to multivariate spline research, particularly as regards               
              the following problems: exact dimension formulas, improved upper               
              and lower bounds on dimensions, dependence of the dimension on                 
              geometric degeneracies, existence and construction of local                    
              bases,identification of useful sub- and superspaces of the full                
              spline space, solvability of interpolation problems, effects of                
              degeneracies on numerical stability and solvability of                         
              interpolation problems, algorithms, surface design, approximation              
              of functions defined on surfaces, and investigation of domain                  
              partitions other than simplicial ones.                                         
                   Splines are smooth piecewise polynomial functions.  They are              
              used ubiquitously to solve problems involving functions of one                 
              independent variable.  Regarding functions of several independent              
              variables, splines (which in this context are called                           
              "multivariate splines") are much less understood and their                     
              structure is vastly more complicated.  Yet they have great                     
              potential for applications such as the solution of partial                     
              differential equations (e.g., modeling fluid flow, heat                        
              distribution, combustion, or radioactive decay), interpolation                 
              and approximation of data, and the design of shapes (e.g., of a                
              vehicle).  They are also fundamental objects that deserve to be                
              studied in their own right.
