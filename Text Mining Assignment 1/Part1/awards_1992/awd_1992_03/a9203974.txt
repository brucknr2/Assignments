Abstract    :
                   Professor Kuranishi has been very active in leading the                   
              Geometry Group at Columbia University.  At present there is                    
              strong interest in this group in studying a number of deep                     
              problems in the area of CR geometry and pseudoconvexity in                     
              several complex variables.  This is an area in which Kuranishi                 
              has made a number of spectacular contributions and still is                    
              working very solidly in this direction. He also intends to                     
              research on metrics of positive sectional curvature, mainly with               
              the complex quadric surface as a suitable test case.  This seems               
              to be quite a rich program which is likely to filter out to the                
              graduate students and postdoctoral workers who are actively                    
              working in his group.
