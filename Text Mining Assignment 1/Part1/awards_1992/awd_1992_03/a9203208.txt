Abstract    :
                   The proposed research is part of a continuing study of                    
              the computational complexity of boolean circuits and related                   
              models of computation, such as threshold circuits and                          
              branching programs.  All the problems to be investigated                       
              concern the manner in which the size, depth and type of gates                  
              in a circuit affect its computational power.                                   
                                                                                             
                   The focus is on circuit whose depth is small (either                      
              independent of input length or logarithmic in input length)                    
              and whose size is either bounded by a polynomial in the input                  
              length or is slightly larger.  The principal goal is to prove                  
              that certain problems cannot be solved under such size and                     
              depth restrictions, and thereby determine the structure of                     
              complexity classes defined by small-depth circuit families.                    
                                                                                             
                   These questions will be investigated by two distinct                      
              methods:  The first is the representation of the behavior of                   
              the circuit or the program by polynomials or similar algebraic                 
              objects, and the use of Fourier analysis to discover                           
              properties of these representations.  The second is the                        
              representation of a circuit's behavior as a program over a                     
              finite monoid, which permits the application of methods from                   
              the global structure theory of finite semigroups.
