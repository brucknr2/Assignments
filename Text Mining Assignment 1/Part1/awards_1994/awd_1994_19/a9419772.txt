Abstract    :
              9419772  Shaw       Some of the more spectacular cases of evolutionary
              adaptation to novel environments include the mosses, and in particular those
              species that grow on mine tailings and other substrates rich in mineral ores. 
              Dr. Jonathan Shaw of Ithaca College, with assistance from several undergraduate
              students, is studying population and species-level genetic variation in
              northern species of the moss genus Mielichhoferia, so-called copper mosses,
              with the goal of understanding historical and ecological controls on the
              present distribution of the four northern species in North America and Europe. 
              In addition to morphological features of the small gametophyte and sporophyte
              stages of the plant, Dr. Shaw is  analyzing variation at allelic loci by
              protein electrophoresis, and will be adding new data from analysis of
              chloroplast DNA variation as well.  Prior studies have demonstrated unique
              marker alleles of individual populations of the moss species, enabling study of
              the path of historical migration and of possible hybridization between species.
                    The pattern of genetic variation among related species of mosses has been
              little studied, despite the interesting haploid nature of the major vegetative
              (gametophytic) stage found in nature.  This study poses several challenging
              contrasts between widespread and narrowly restricted taxa, between species with
              wide genetic variability and those quite limited, and between reproductively
              isolated taxa and those potentially able to hybridize with relatives.
