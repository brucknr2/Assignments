Abstract    :
              9419776  Rose    Modern orders of mammals first appeared in the fossil record 
              and  began  to diversify during the early Eocene age,  52-55  million  years 
              ago.   This  research  will  use  the   most  extensive  collection of early
              Eocene  mammal  skeletons  in  existence to present the first comprehensive
              overview of the  skeletal  anatomy and adaptations of early  Eocene  mammals. 
              Locomotion  and related behaviors of extinct fossil  mammals  will  be 
              determined through rigorous anatomical comparisons  with  modern  mammals 
              whose behavior has  been  documented.  Quantitative  image  analyses of joint
              and  bone  shapes  in  modern  mammals will identify skeletal structures  that 
              are  associated  with  particular  modes  of  locomotion.   Those  results 
              will  be  used to infer the locomotor  behavior  of  fossil  mammals  from
              their skeletal anatomy.   Quantitative  analysis  of exceptionally
              well-preserved teeth  and  skulls  from  fossils  closely-spaced throughout the
              3 million  year  period  will define the anatomy and relationships of  fossil 
              mammals  and show how evolution proceeded during the  Eocene  increase  in
              species diversity.  This research will  provide  new   data  on  the  anatomy, 
              adaptations,  behavior,   and  evolution  of  the basal members of modern
              mammalian  orders  and their archaic contemporaries.  It will lead to a broader
               understanding  of  community evolution  through  the  recent  history of
              mammals and insight into the stability of  mammal  communities over time.
