Abstract    :
              9419156  Von Damm         Hydrothermal system at fast- and superfast-spreading 
              ridges have not been investigated and various trends  (geochemical and
              otherwise) suggest that the variability in  hydrothermal systems in slow to
              moderate rate spreading  ridges cannot be extended to superfast ridges.  This
              project  involves an ALVIN dive program to study gas and fluid  chemistry of
              hydrothermal systems on the East Pacific Rise  17-21degrees south.  The
              intensity of local hydrothermal  activities here are indicated by the He-plume.
