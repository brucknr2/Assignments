Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support for the purchase and development of  several
              pieces of instrument which will be used to significantly  advance a current
              research effort supported by the National Institutes  of Health in the area of
              novel three-dimensional (3-D) microscopy.  Specifically, the 3-D microscopy
              system currently being investigated  will be developed into a high-resolution
              fluorescence microscopy system  with real-time reconstruction capability by
              acquiring an Argon laser,  an x-y computer-controlled scanning system, and a
              workstation. The  Argon laser at 470 nm extends the microscopy system to be
              able to  operate in a fluorescent mode, thereby potentially making the system a
               very useful and powerful tool in many branches of biology and the life 
              sciences. The x-y scanning system allows the microscopy system to  perform
              specimen-scanning instead of optical beam-scanning, thereby  ensuring that the
              resolution and contrast are identical across the  entire field of view. The
              workstation will improve the speed of the  analysis of the 3-D data obtained
              from the microscopy system by an  order of magnitude, thereby making it
              possible for real-time 3-D data  manipulation and image presentation. The
              results of the proposed  instrumentation development activity could lead to
              better 3-D  information processing in areas such as real-time image processing,
               microscopy, and data storage and acquisition in the life sciences.
