Abstract    :
              Abstract  Murnick  CTS-9419440    The primary objective of the proposed work is
              to determine the effectiveness of a VHF diode reactor for reactive ion etching
              of silicon in CF4 plasmas.  The PI's point out that operation at VHF ( 30-300
              MHz) frequencies rather than at the standard 13.56 MHz, at least in the case of
              amorphous silicon deposition, can result in increased deposition rates, reduced
              damage, and increased film uniformity.  The PI's expect the discharge physics
              to be quite different in the VHF regime as compared to the standard 100
              KHz-13.56 MHz range and provide some evidence for this from results of their
              previous work.  They point out that VHF operation has not as yet been applied
              to etching, and propose to determine etch rates, uniformity, anisotropy and
              damage for the etching of silicon in CF4 plasmas.  Frequencies from 13.56 to
              135 MHz, pressures from 1 to 50 mTorr, and a wide range of applied voltages
              will be employed.  If possible, plasma conditions which optimize certain
              aspects of the etch process will be identified.  Diagnostics on the etched
              materials will be carried out in collaboration with the Army Research
              Laboratory conveniently located at Fort Monmouth, using standard surface
              techniques including SEM, profilometry, and TEM.  Use will also be made of
              ARL's microwave interferometer, currently on loan to Rutgers, to measure
              absolute, spatially averaged plasma densities.  Meta-stable argon populations
              will also be measured using a line-of sight self-absorption technique.    The
              PI's also propose to collaborate with Dr. Meya Meyyappan of Scientific Research
              Associates in the modeling of the experimental plasmas.  He hopes to provide
              the PI's with a 2-D version of his current 1-D plasma simulation code and will
              assist in the modeling effort in order to provide  support for the
              interpretation of the etching results.
