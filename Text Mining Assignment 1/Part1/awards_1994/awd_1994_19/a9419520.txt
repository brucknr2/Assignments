Abstract    :
              9419520  Ku    The Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Ultra
              High-  Speed Integrated Circuits and Systems is a multi-site Center with  the
              University of California, San Diego and San Diego State  University.  The
              Center research addresses critical issues in the  design and fabrication of
              ultra high-speed circuits for  communications and digital processing systems. 
              The Center  continues to meet the renewal criteria of the Industry/University 
              Cooperative Research Centers Program.    This award provides funding for one
              year to the University of  California, San Diego under the "Self-Sufficient
              Partnership for  Research" Program.    Additional funding is provided by the
              U.S. Department of Navy  (NCCOSC) to augment the Centers ongoing research
              program and to  obtain a membership in the Center.      The Program Manager
              recommends the University of California, San  Diego be awarded $50,000 for one
              year.  An additional $24,609 is  recommended for one year with funds provided
              by the U.S. Department  of Navy (NCCOSC).
