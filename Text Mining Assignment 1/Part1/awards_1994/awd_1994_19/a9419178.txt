Abstract    :
              This Small Grant for Exploratory Research is supported by the  Inogranic,
              Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program for  development of a novel
              synthetic route to functional  metalloproteins.  Dr. John Caradonna of the
              Department of  Chemistry, Yale University, will use a combinatorial approach to
               construct proteins with active metal sites inside host proteins  of known
              structure.  Effectively, reaction initiates a search for  the constellation of
              backbone positions that satisfies the  geometry of the active site without
              affecting the host protein's  tertiary structure.  The mutant proteins
              constructed would be  tested for enzymatic activity.  The initial experiments
              will  attempt to synthesize the iron site of superoxide dismutase, so a 
              successful outcome could lead to a powerful tool in reducing  tissue damage
              resulting from  superoxide.  One immediate result  will be the ability to test
              the effect of secondary protein  topologies on the chemistry of
              metalloproteins.    The active sites of metal-containing enzymes consist of
              metals  bound to proteins folded in a certain pattern.  By devising a  means of
              adding the metal without disrupting the folding pattern,  this research could
              lead to a method of synthesizing  metalloenzymes that are functional, and thus
              ready for use in  biological investigations and applications.  In the process,
              the  effect of protein structure on activity of metalloenzymes will be 
              studied.
