Abstract    :
              9419366  Waff    Electrical conductivity will be measured on mixtures of basalt
              and  loivine (simulating partially molten upper mantle) that have been  heated
              at mantle pressures for several hundred hours. Conductivity  of the bulk sample
              (basalt plus olivine mixtures) increases  dramatically when melting occurs. The
              bulk sample conductivity is  related principally to how melt is distributed in
              the sample and  how much melt is present. These measurements are important for 
              understanding the distribution and amount of melt present in the  mantle near
              mid-ocean ridges.
