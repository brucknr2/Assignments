Abstract    :
              9419111  Self  This study is to map, sample, and analyze by both  granulometry
              and clast morphology the various facies of the  1991 ignimbrite at Mount
              Pinatubo, Philippines.  Fabric  studies of the main body of the ignimbrite by
              anisotropy of  magnetic susceptibility (AMS) will also be undertaken.  The 
              main aim is to better understand the lithofacies and  facies  association of
              the deposit, its emplacement mechanisms, and  the nature of the pyroclastic
              flows.  The information, which  will be put into the well-constrained temporal
              framework of  the 3.5-hour-long climax, will shed much-needed light on the 
              current debate in volcanology concerning the nature of, and  the spectrum of
              deposition mechanisms from, pyroclastic  flows.  The study will also provide
              information on the  amount od co-ignimbrite ash generated during the 1991 
              eruption.  Without detailed studies of ignimbrites, models  of pyroclastic flow
              emplacement will continue to outstrip  the amount of information available from
              actual examples  that have been explored in detail, and in this regard the 
              value of results from the new, large Pinatubo deposit should  not be lost.
