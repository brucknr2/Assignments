Abstract    :
              9419244  Jouse    While the detailed mechanisms for storing memories in the
              brain are still unknown, neurobiologists have identified specific sites where
              information is stored.  One of these memory sites is the mammalian hippocampus.
               With this award, a collaborative team consisting of nuclear systems engineers
              and a neuroscientist will conduct theoretical modeling studies to test ideas
              about how information is stored in the hippocampus.  These studies will provide
              new ways of thinking about biological memory formation, that will impact future
              work on the cellular mechanisms of learning, and related engineering
              applications such as neural network models of learning systems.
