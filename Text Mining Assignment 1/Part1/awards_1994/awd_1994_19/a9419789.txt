Abstract    :
              This proposal is a request for a Packard InstantImager Electronic 
              Autoradiography System which electronically locates and measures  radioactivity
              directly on gels, blots, thin layer chromatography,  tissue slices, or any
              other flat samples up to 20 X 24 cm2. This  instrument will directly measure in
              real time disintegrations  eliminating the need for either X-ray film or
              storage phosphor screens.    The Boston University biochemistry department is a
              large multifaceted  teaching and research department. Most members perform
              basic research  in molecular and/or cellular biochemistry. Usually this
              research  requires radiolabeling techniques in order to detect small amounts of
               biologically relevant molecules. Radiolabeled proteins, RNA, DNA and  lipids
              are often separated by gel electrophoresis or thin layer  chromatography and
              visualized by autoradiography using X-ray film.  X-ray film autoradiography has
              distinct disadvantages such as low  sensitivity and small linear range making
              quantitative analysis  difficult and laborious. Typically, samples need to be
              exposed  overnight or longer. Often multiple exposures are necessary in order
              to  detect both high and low abundant molecules on the same gel. Most 
              researchers, when quantitation is critical, remove radiolabeled  material from
              solid supports in order to measure disintegration using a  scintillation
              counter after visualization by X-ray film. Recent  advances in technology are
              making alternate instruments available to  locate and directly measure
              radioactivity on flat samples with more  sensitivity in far less time. The
              instrument will help research efforts  and will be used in several courses as
              an instrument to teach  essentials regarding radioactivity measurements.
