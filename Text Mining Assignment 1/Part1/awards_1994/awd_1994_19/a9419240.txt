Abstract    :
              9419240  Yogodzinski   An ion microprobe and isotopic study of Aleutian high Mg#
              silicates (phenocrysts, xenocrysts, xenoliths, glass inclusions, volcanic
              rocks) is proposed here.  The aim of this study is to understand the regional
              importance of the various primitive Aleutian melt types, and to infer the
              predominant mixing, melting, and reaction processes that occur in the Aleutian
              mantle wedge.  The approach is to use the trace element and isotopic
              characteristics of thigh Mg# minerals as tracers of mantle wedge processes. 
              There has been a recent re-emphasis on primary calc-alkaline andesitic magmas
              in subduction related magmatic arcs, with high Mg#'s, and high Ni and Cr
              contents, consistent with equilibration with mantle olivine and spinel.  The
              presence of these lavas in arcs raises once again the question of the bulk
              composition of crust formed by subduction-related magmatism.  This study will
              address this broad issue by defining more clearly the various primitive melts
              which are represented in the Aleutian arc, and by providing an improved basis
              for identifying the predominant processes which occur in the Aleutian mantle
              wedge.
