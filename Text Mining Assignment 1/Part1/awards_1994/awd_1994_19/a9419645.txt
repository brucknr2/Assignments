Abstract    :
              9419645  Ricklefs  This research will test the hypothesis that ecological
              relationships of populations evolve in consistent directions with increasing
              age, and these changes ultimately result in increased probability of extinction
              through restricted habitat breadth and reduced population size. To address this
              hypothesis, the investigators will use an historical and evolutionary approach.
              The research will focus on land bird populations of the West Indies. Previous
              work has suggested that older populations exhibit restricted habitat breadth
              and reduced population size, and have higher risk of extinction, than do
              younger populations. In this study, evolutionary age of an island population
              will be estimated by the genetic divergence between it and the most closely
              related sister population on a neighboring island or on the continent. Each
              population provides a time-slice through evolutionary trends of long duration.
              The chronological sequence of populations will allow reconstruction of
              historical trends in habitat breadth, population density, and genetic diversity
              that apply generally to small land birds, and to examine their consistency
              across taxa.    This research will allow us to gain a better understanding of
              ecological and evolutionary processes associated with species extinction. A
              better understanding of extinction processes of birds on islands can provide
              the framework for conservation of declining populations of species in an
              increasingly fragmented landscape through the US and the world.
