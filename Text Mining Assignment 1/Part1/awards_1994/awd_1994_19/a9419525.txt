Abstract    :
              9419525  Hauri    The PI will utilize a thermochromatic liquid crystal-sheet
              lighting technique to measure the  entrainment of ambient fluid into thermally
              buoyant plume structures under a variety of  experimental conditions.  The flux
              of the entrained fluid will be compared to that of the injected  fluid to
              calculate absolute and fractional entrainment.  In this way, entrainment into
              steady state  conduits, thermal conduit solitary waves, and time dependent
              conduit flow will be measured and  characterized.  The PI will also vary the
              chemistry of the fluids to investigate the effects of  different rheologies on
              entrainment, which can be tested by examining entrainment in a plume  conduit
              which traverses layers of different density and viscosity.  This research has
              the potential  to evaluate mantle plumes as "sampling probes" of the mantle
              through which they pass, and  when combined with existing and future
              geochemical data, results form seismic tomography, and  experimental and
              theoretical determinations of deep mantle rheologies, will allow the PI to
              place  firmer constraints on the locations of geochemically distinct reservoirs
              in the convecting mantle  ***
