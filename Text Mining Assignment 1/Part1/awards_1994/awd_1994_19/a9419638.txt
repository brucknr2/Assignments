Abstract    :
              ATM-9419638  VanZandt  Abstract           We propose to continue the operation
              and development of the  Flatland Atmospheric Observatory (FAO), located in very
              flat  terrain near Champaign-Urbana, Illinois, for three years.  
              Instrumentation at FAO includes a five-beam 50 MHz wind-profiling  radar, a
              five-beam 915 MHz wind-profiling radar with a radio-  acoustic sounding system
              (RASS) to measure temperature profiles, a  ground meteorological station, an
              array of 24 digital barographs  centered on FAO, and a facility to launch
              radiosondes to measure  temperature and humidity. All of the instruments except
              the  radiosondes operate continuously through thee year.       FAO will be use
              for atmospheric research principally in the  following areas:  (1) Studies of
              the mesoscale wind field,  particularly gravity waves and momentum flux;  and
              (2) Studies of  the planetary boundary layer, particularly structure and 
              entrainment, heat budget, and precipitaion classification.   Considerable
              effort will be devoted to exploring the technology of  wind-profiling radars; 
              that is, their capabilities for observing  microscale and mesoscale wind
              structures, as well as long term  vertical velocities.
