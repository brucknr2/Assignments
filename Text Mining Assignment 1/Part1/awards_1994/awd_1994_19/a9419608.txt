Abstract    :
              9419608  Winters  This proposal from Catholic University requests partial 
              support to conduct a workshop that address strategic topics  related to
              biomedical engineering curriculum development.    The purpose of the workshop
              is to enhance the knowledge and  capabilities of biomedical engineering faculty
              and to  improve the quality of the educational experience for  undergraduate
              biomedical engineering students.  Engineering  education is undergoing
              significant revamping, and much of  the curricula innovation that is occurring
              is tied to the  area of engineering design.  This workshop will bring  together
              biomedical engineering faculty who teach courses  involving biomedical
              engineering design, as well as key  outside experts in engineering design to
              share insights and  experiences with the participants.    The second objective
              of the workshop is to use it as a  mechanism to create a BME Undergraduate
              Design Resource  Guide.  Participants to the workshop will provide resource 
              material, and the resulting guide will be distributed to all  participating
              institutions.  ***
