Abstract    :
              9419455  Reed       It has long been recognized that the exact timing, location 
               and severity of local weather events are determined by what is  termed by
              meteorologist as mesoscale processes.       The Principal Investigator's main
              objective is to carry out   numerical simulations of mesoscale weather systems
              in order to  identify key physical processes of three distinct mesoscale 
              phenomena.  These three phenomena are polar lows (small vortices   that form
              over polar seas and in intense cases present a hazard to  ship operations),
              mesoscale convective systems, and fronts.       In the polar low work, a wider
              range of synoptic situations   and geographic setting will be studied than
              heretofore with the aim  of understanding how different components of polar low
              formation  interact under different circumstances.  The research on mesoscale 
              convection will focus on how model resolution and model  representation of
              unresolved convection affect the development of  mesoscale convective systems,
              particularly in the early stages of  oceanic storms.  The frontal work will be
              concerned mainly with  diagnosing how fronts form in the type of oceanic
              cyclone that does  not form on a preexisting front , but that creates its own
              fronts  as it evolves.       Research will be primarily accomplished through
              numerical  modeling studies conducted in conjunction with scientists from the 
              National Center for Atmospheric Research.  ***
