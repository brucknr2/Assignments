Abstract    :
              9419323  Mahoney       This is an integrated bathymetric, geophysical, and 
              petrological/geochemical study of the Southeast Indian Ridge.  The project will
              focus on evaluating the effects of mantle  temperature variations on mid-ocean
              ridge processes, at constant  spreading rate and on furthering understanding of
              the nature and  origin of the complex Indian Ocean mantle.  ***
