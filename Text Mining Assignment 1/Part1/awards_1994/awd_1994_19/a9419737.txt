Abstract    :
              9419737  Bishop    This proposal requests funds to establish a travel costs
              award program for American scientists to attend the Fourth International
              Congress of Comparative Physiology and Biochemistry to be held in Birmingham,
              U. K. , August 6-11, 1995.  The award program is divided into two parts for the
              support of young scientists and students presenting contributed papers and for
              the support of primary symposia speakers that require assistance with travel
              costs.  The award program will require application with justification by
              interested parties.  The applications will be judged by an awards committee
              managed by the Division of Comparative Physiology and Biochemistry of the
              American Society of Zoologists.  ***
