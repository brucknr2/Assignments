Abstract    :
              9419997  Baum       The plant order Malvales contains ca. 5000 species of mainly
               tropical plants including several of economic importance (cotton,  chocolate,
              okra, hibiscus).  This study by Dr. David Baum of  Harvard University and his
              colleague Dr. William Alverson will  employ molecular techniques and analyses
              of plant morphology to  study the evolution of the order, and in particular the
              phylogeny  of certain groups at three nested levels.  The placement of the 
              order Malvales within the major dicot radiation of flowering  plants; the
              placement of the family Bombacaceae (the kapok family)  within the order; and
              relationships among the tribes and genera of  Bombacaceae, are the three levels
              of emphasis.       The molecular studies will involve the determination of DNA 
              sequences from representative species of Bombacaceae and related  Malvaceae,
              Tiliaceae, and Sterculiaceae, with emphasis on several  chloroplast genes.  In
              parallel the genera of Bombacaceae and  relatives in the other three families
              will be studied for  morphological characteristics, and the combined datasets
              will be  used to infer phylogenetic relationships among the taxa.  The 
              resulting phylogenetic framework can be used to explain the great  diversity of
              floral form within Bombacaceae and to account for  evolutionary shifts in
              chromosome number and for geographical  migrations through time.  ??
