Abstract    :
              Support is requested for an instrumentation upgrade to enhance the  research
              facilities provided by the Microscopy Center at the University  of
              Massachusetts at Amherst. The Center and its staff provide a  complete range of
              research and training services in light and electron  microscopy, with emphasis
              on biological applications. Replacement of  the laser and light sensing system
              of an existing confocal microscope  will provide the sensitivity needed for
              projects on living cells, and  an inverted microscope configuration will
              facilitate microinjection  experiments. For image acquisition, display and
              processing, replacement  of an outdated Micro Vax computer with an Indigo
              graphics workstation  capable of handling the three dimensional reconstruction
              and rendering  of large confocal data sets is requested. Acquisition of a rapid
               freezing device and freeze-substitution unit w ill enable users to take 
              advantage of the improved structural preservation and antigen retention 
              provided by cryotechniques.    As examples of the work that will be made
              possible by these upgrades,  the research projects of seven major users and
              eleven minor users of  the Microscopy Center, covering a wide range of topics
              are described.  The projects, all of which are externally funded, are focused
              on  important problems in cell biology, neurobiology, and biogenesis.    Strong
              institutional support for the Microscopy Center is provided by  contributions
              from four Administrative units, which currently exceeds  $120,000 per year.
              Users are charged fees based on the cost of  consumable supplies, and
              microscope time. This combined income covers  the salaries of two professional
              microscopists, maintenance contracts  on the electron microscopes and modest
              repair and replacement costs.
