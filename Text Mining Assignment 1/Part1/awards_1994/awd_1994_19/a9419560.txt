Abstract    :
              9419560 Schlesinger  The thermodynamics of bismuth and lead  in liquid and solid
              iron-carbon solutions are investigated using an adapted isopiestic technique. 
              The use of bismuth in place of lead in free-machining steels and the removal of
              lead from free-machining steel scrap will benefit from a better understanding
              of lead and bismuth distribution between the phases (liquid, solid, and vapor)
              in steelmaking operations.  This research improves on the results of previous
              investigations of the iron-lead and iron-bismuth alloy systems.  It includes
              the effects of added carbon content on the chemical potential of bismuth and
              lead in liquid alloys and delta iron ferrite.  The focus is on determining the
              interaction coefficients needed for modeling liquid iron-carbon-(bismuth, lead)
              solutions as a function of temperature and composition.   %%% This research
              produces thermodynamic data needed for reliable estimates of the disposition of
              bismuth and lead in steelmaking systems.  It advances the level of high
              temperature thermodynamic research performed in the U.S.  ***
