Abstract    :
              The proposed research is on layout driven synthesis, i.e. the  intersection of
              logic synthesis and physical design.  The focus is  on restructuring logic
              networks in synthesized digital systems.   Four topics, which meet the goals of
              improving routing efficiency  or power consumption, are being investigated. 
              These are:        1) Incremental logic resynthesis to control wiring,          
              2) Coupling wiring with logic restructuring and finding         optimizations
              to eliminate wiring overflows.           3) Use of generalized Reed-Muller
              forms to analyze logic as an         aid to:           - designing cell
              libraries and for technology mapping,           - developing new multi level
              optimization techniques,           - designing networks of provably good
              testability.           4) Develop new methods for power optimization, at the   
                   technology independent and technology dependent levels in         logic
              synthesis, and also find better routing tools to handle         power
              constraints.
