Abstract    :
              9419165  Miller  This award by the Advanced Materials Programs in the Divisions 
              of Chemistry and Materials Research provides partial  participant support for
              the Fourth International Conference on  Molecule-based Magnets to be held in
              Salt Lake City, Utah,  October 16-21, 1994. This conference will facilitate 
              communication and development of new ideas in the highly  interdisciplinary
              area of molecular magnetism. Up to 150  chemists, physicists and materials
              scientists from academia,  industry and Federal agencies will be represented. 
              Participation will be international in scope. The proceedings  of the
              conference will be published.    Molecule/polymer-based magnets are a new class
              of materials of  wide technological application. This conference will provide a
               forum for experts to describe recent results and provide a  mechanism for
              students and faculty new to the research area to  learn from world-class
              experts.
