Abstract    :
              9419640  Ostfeld   A critical role for ecologists is to predict the consequences
              of perturbations to communities of interacting species. Traditional approaches
              to understanding the determinants of community structure and dynamics have
              focused on direct effects of populations on other populations and have ignored
              indirect effects. The PI's will begin to test the importance of both direct and
              indirect interactions in oak forest of southeastern New York state.
              Specifically, episodic mast production by oak trees stimulates a series of
              direct and indirect effects by causing transient increases in the density of
              rodent populations, and changes in space use by deer. Rodents, in turn, appear
              to be key regulators of low-density gypsy moth populations, and are the primary
              reservoirs for the etiological agent of Lyme Disease. White-tailed deer are the
              primary host for adult deer ticks, the vectors of Lyme Disease. The purpose of
              this project will be to demonstrate the effects of mast years on rodent
              population dynamics in oak forests. This will be tested with a large scale
              field experiment in which acorns are added to or removed from replicated 2.25
              ha plots. Rodent populations will be monitored for one year.   %%%  This is an
              award that is designed to demonstrate the feasibility of the large scale acorn
              manipulation experiment, and to determine if rodent populations respond to the
              manipulation as predicted. Such information will provide the first step in
              understanding the direct and indirect effects of acorn production in deciduous
              forest landscapes.
