Abstract    :
              Hobbie  9419078       The goals of this project is to begin intellectual 
              synthesis in our understanding of how estuarine systems  function.  Synthesis
              in estuarine research can take many  forms.  One type of estuarine synthesis
              has the long-term  goal of achieving an understanding of estuarine processes 
              and estuarine ecology sufficient to predict the responses of  these coastal
              systems to a wide variety of human impacts  including climate change and of
              human management options.  This US Scientific Committee on Problems in the
              Environment  (SCOPE) workshop will help chart the course for achieving 
              synthesis by:    *    Illustrating by case histories how synthesis has 
              actually been carried out in various              ecological  systems,
              especially in estuaries  *    Gaining community agreement on the questions that
              must  be answered to achieve a synthetic           view of  estuarine responses
              to human impacts  *    Identifying the methods, data, and models needed to 
              accomplish this synthesis.    This U.S. effort will then feed into the
              international SCOPE  activities related to estaurine environments.
