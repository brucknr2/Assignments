Abstract    :
              This award is a cooperative grant to Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO),
              Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) and Joint Oceanographic
              Institutions (JOI) for activities associated with the acquisition and
              development of a shipboard communications system that will be capable of high
              data rate transfers from ship to shore.  The communications system will be
              installed on the research vessel THOMAS THOMPSON, a 279-foot vessel, owned by
              the Navy and operated by the University of Washington.  The system will be
              heavily used in 1995 and 1996 to support the JGOFS Arabian Sea Program.    This
              proposal is part of a cooperative proposal to develop a prototype shipboard
              communications system called SEANET.  Proposals included in the cooperative
              grant are:   Proposal #           PI       Institution   #95-10117 Andy Maffei 
              Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution   #95-09870 Dale Chayes  Lamont Doherty
              Earth Observatory   #94-19306 Ellen Kappel  Joint Oceanographic Institutions  
              #95-26019 Rex Buddenberg  Naval Postgraduate School    These proposals outline
              an effort to develop a prototype shipboard communications systems as follows:  
               1) Dale Chayes at LDEO will purchase the shipboard hardware ($53,000), work
              with Andy Maffei to integrate the hardware, travel to Oman to install the
              system on the R/V THOMPSON, and participate in one cruise in order to trouble
              shoot the system and teach the THOMPSON's technicians/scientists how to use it.
               LDEO will also provide some administrative support to establish a billing
              system for INMARSAT charges resulting from use of the system during the year,
              and Chayes will remove and redeploy the system on another ship when JGOFS
              cruises are completed.    2) Andy Maffei at WHOI will assist Chayes with the
              integration of the hardware and will provide user-friendly software for the
              shipboard communications system.  He will integrate the system's hardware and
              software, including the ship's system, INMARSAT satellites, earth
              groundstations, routers, and Internet connection s.  He will be available to
              trouble-shoot the system as necessary during operations.    3) Ellen Kappel
              (JOI) and Rex Buddenburg (NPGS):  Kappel will provide overall program
              management, including communication of program goals and progress to all UNOLS
              institutions, and will integrate the NSF's SEANET effort with complementary
              efforts of other agencies, including but not limited to NOAA, USCG and NASA. 
              Buddenburg, a satellite communications expert, will provide technical
              coordination with NASA during the system development and analysis of options to
              use other satellite systems.    The goals of creating a system that will
              support high-speed-data transfer from ship to shore and connections to the
              Internet are part of OCE's plan for the High Performance Computing and
              Communications (HPCC) initiative.  Therefore, joint support for this effort
              will be provided by the Oceanographic Sciences Research Section (OSRS) and by
              the Oceanographic Facilities Section (OCFS).
