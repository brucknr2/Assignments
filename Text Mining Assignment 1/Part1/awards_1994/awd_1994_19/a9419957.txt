Abstract    :
                  Lynn Riddiford                            #IBN 9419957  Proposed are studies
              to elucidate the role of the nuclear 29kDa  protein that specifically binds
              juvenile hormone (jp29) in the  regulation of larval molting and metamorphosis.
               Studies on the  tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, will concentrate on three
              aspects:  1) isolation of other nuclear protein(s) with which jp29 may 
              interact and their subsequent cloning and sequencing to elucidate  their
              function, 2) immunocytochemcial localization within the  nucleus, and 3)
              developmental and endocrine regulation of jp29.  We  also plan to isolate the
              homologous gene from Drosophila containing  the Manduca jp29 cDNA under the
              control of a heat shock promoter  will be used to determine the effects of
              over-expression of this  protein on development, reproduction, and JH esterase
              production in  the presence and absence of JH.  Also, immunocytochemical
              studies  will concentrate on its developmental and endocrine regulation in 
              various tissues.  This study in the two insects should help  elucidate the
              molecular mode of action of JH in directing  metamorphosis and whether jp29 has
              a functional role in adult  responses to JH.   ***
