              which is expected to have 160-190 participants, will enable researchers from
              the United States and abroad to discuss recent developments and ideas regarding
              the molecular mechanisms of sensing and movement in simple bacterial systems. 
              Scientific sessions will compare and contrast the sensory and locomotor systems
              in diverse prokaryotes, focusing on each fundamental step in their signal
              transduction pathways: (a) transmembrane signaling by chemo- and
              photo-receptors; (b) signal transduction by intracellular phosphorylation
              cascades; (c) sensory control of cellular motility and gene expression; and (d)
              the mechanics of cell motility.    The meeting format will include
              approximately 70 oral presentations and 80 posters, allowing virtually all
              laboratories working in this rapidly moving field to present their key
              findings.  The requested funds are for students expenses only.  In previous
              years the meeting has provided an important forum for emerging concepts and
              generalizations concerning bacterial sensing and motility, and has presented
              the first molecular details co ncerning the structure and function of a family
              of signaling proteins that are pervasive in prokaryotic organisms and now are
              turning up in eukaryotic cells as well. ***                           ;
