Abstract    :
              9419310  Licht      This project will examine the molecular biology and
              physiology of an unusual dual-function blood binding protein.  Based on
              preliminary data, this protein has structural similarity to vitamin-D-binding
              protein (VDBP), but Dr. Licht has determined that it also serves as a high
              affinity thyroid hormone binding protein (TBP); normally these two hormones are
              transported by very different types of protein.  He will attempt to identify
              the structural features that permit this mixed function and study how the
              synthesis of the binding protein in the liver is regulated by hormones in order
              to test the hypothesis that it may be involved in the thyroidal regulation of
              growth or vitamin D utilization.  ***
