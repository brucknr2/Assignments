Abstract    :
              9419406  Tsen  A study of interface structure and magnetic domain structure in
              magnetic thin layers will be undertaken.  Two specific topics and methods are
              targeted for study, namely:     (1) Investigation of Interface Structure in
              Co/Cu/Co  and Fe/Cr/Fe Magnetic Multilayers by         High-Resolution Electron
              Microscopy;     (2) Studies of Magnetic Domain Structure in Co/Cu and Fe/Cr
              Bilayers by Lorentz Microscopy.    The results of this proposal will provide
              better insight toward our understanding of the Co/Cu/Co and Fe/Cr/Fe systems
              which have recently been shown to exhibit giant magnetoresistance as well as
              the oscillation of magnetoresistance associated with increasing thickness of
              the nonmagnetic interlayer.  These artificial superlattices are important due
              to their potential applications in magnetic field sensor devices and
              magnetoresistive read heads.  ***
