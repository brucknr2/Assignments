Abstract    :
              Funds are requested for acquisition of a time-of-flight,  matrix-assisted laser
              desorption ionization mass spectrometer  (TOF-MALDI-MS) for analysis of
              proteins, covalent protein-ligand  complexes, glycopeptides, phosphopeptides,
              designed peptides with  nonprotein amino acids, photoaffinity modified
              peptides, and enzymatic  digests of posttranslationally-modified proteins.
              Projects will be  conducted by seven major faculty users from the departments
              of  Chemistry, Biochemistry & Cell Biology, Allergy, Rheumatology &  Clinical
              Immunology, and Physiology & Biophysics whose research  requires analysis of
              modified peptides. The instrument will be housed  in the Center for the
              Analysis and Synthesis of Macromolecules in the  Department of Physiology &
              Biophysics and operated as a  user-accessible, operator-maintained shared
              facility. The Center for  Biotechnology, a New York State Center for Advanced
              Technology will  provide staffing and administrative oversight for the
              instrument.
