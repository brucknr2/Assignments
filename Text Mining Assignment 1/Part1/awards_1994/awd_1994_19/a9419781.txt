Abstract    :
              9419781  Crawford    Metabolism in the heart utilizes glucose as a source of
              energy.  Glucose metabolism is affected by the concentrations of the enzymes
              that break down this nutrient (i.e., enzymes in the glycolytic pathway).  Dr.
              Crawford intends to measure the rate of glucose utilization, the variation in
              enzyme concentration for all enzymes in the glycolytic pathway and determine
              the molecular mechanisms responsible for the change in enzyme concentration. 
              To explore these processes, the teleost fish (Fundulus heteroclitus), a
              cold-blooded organism that lives in different thermal environments, will be
              utilized.  Populations of this species should modify heart metabolism to adapt
              to these different environments.  These modifications should reveal mechanisms
              that regulate glucose use.  He intends to empirically verify these results by
              altering the concentration of one or more glycolytic enzymes in cardiac muscle
              cells and quantify the effect on glucose utilization.  The data from this
              approach will contribute to knowing the role of gene expression in metabolic
              processes as well as provide empirical evidence addressing questions concerning
              metabolic control.  ***
