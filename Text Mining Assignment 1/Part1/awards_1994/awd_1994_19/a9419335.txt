Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities program is
              to aid the  Department of Chemistry at University of Colorado at Boulder in the
              purchase of a scanning  probe microscope (SPM).  This instrument will be used
              in the following research programs:    1)  Heteroepitaxial 2-D crystals on
              highly oriented pyrolytic graphite which grow under liquid  crystal films; and
              Self-assembled monolayers on glass.    2)  Synthesis and topographic
              characterization by SPM of chemically deposited films.    The scanning probe
              microscope (SPM) enables researchers to image atoms directly.  The  technique
              uses the piezoelectric effect which involves bringing an extremely sharp metal
              needle  within a few angstroms of the samples surface.  The distance is small
              enough for electrons to  leak or tunnel across the gap and generate a minute
              current.  As the gap between the tip and the  sample increases, the current
              decreases.  As the probe crosses the sample, moving back and  forth across its
              surface, the probe traces out a contour map of the sample's surface atoms.  The
               SPM is used in the control of material used to fabricate semiconductor
              circuits.
