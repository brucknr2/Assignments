Abstract    :
                This award is for support for a two year project to expand  the geographic and
              stratigraphic data base for the Sirius  Group by studying deposits in the
              Shackleton Glacier-Queen  Maud Mountains region of Antarctica.  Field
              activities will  center on further development of the marine and terrestrial 
              stratigraphy, mapping, and collection of paleobotanical and  paleozoological
              material.  An attempt will be made to  duplicate the Pliocene marine and
              terrestrial climate,  glacial and biotic record documented 100-150 km away in
              the  Beardmore Valley.  Micropaleontological investigations of  foraminifera,
              diatoms, palynomorphs, macroplants and insects  will be used to data strata and
              provide paleoenvironmental  information.  These new data will address questions
              related  to interior ice sheet history, among others.
