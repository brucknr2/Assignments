Abstract    :
              9419532  Prentice  This award supports a US contribution to a collaborative
              project  with Russian and Swedish glacial geologists to test the existence  of
              an hypothesized Holocene ice dome centered on the Kara Sea.   This hypothesized
              dome could account for a maximum of 17 meters of  sea level rise and so the
              question of its existence has important  implications for models of Holocene
              climate.  However, its  existence is a highly contentious question.  The goal
              of the  project is to produce well constrained radiocarbon ages of the 
              northernmost terrestrial moraine complex along the margin of the  Kara Sea. 
              The work will specifically focus on the area east of  Dikson, Russia, where the
              Leneevaya River intersects the northern  Taimyr moraine.  Accurate ages of the
              moraines are required in  order to determine if an ice dome is likely to have
              existed in the  Kara Sea region during the last ice age.  If the existence of
              the  ice dome is supported, then this work would also be key to  formulating
              further work to fully characterize the dome.  The  results of this project are
              expected to help resolve an important  and contentious question about the
              nature and extent of ice sheets  during the last ice age.
