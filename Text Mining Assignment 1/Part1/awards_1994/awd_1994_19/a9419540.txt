Abstract    :
              9419540  Silevitch    This award provides funding for a three year continuing
              award to  support the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for the 
              Enhancement of Science and Mathematics Education (CESAME).  This  Center,
              organized within the framework of the I/UCRC model, is a  multi-sector
              partnership of federal, state, private foundation, and  industry partners. 
              CESAME enables K-12 elementary and secondary  teachers in the State of
              Massachusetts to design and implement  their own innovative ideas of teaching
              science and mathematics to  children.  CESAME is concerned with fostering
              projects conducted by  teachers concerned with enhancing K-12 education.  By
              applying the  IUC approach to education, CESAME is systematically disseminate 
              results and nurture the development of "teacher-mentors."  These  leaders are
              vitally needed to spark widespread positive changes in  the U.S. educational
              system.  Minimum funding for the CESAME effort  consists of a three-way match
              between the NSF (the prime federal  partner), the Bay State Skills Corporation
              (BSSC) (the prime state  partner) and other federal, industry and private
              education  foundation sponsors.  This mixture of state, federal, and private 
              sector participation is critical in an area such as precollege  education. 
              This program has been coordinated with Dr. Joyce Evans  of the Teacher
              Enhancement Program, Division for Elementary and  Secondary Education,
              Directorate for Education and Human Resources.    The U.S. Department of Army
              has provided additional funding to  augment the Centers ongoing research and to
              obtain a membership in  the Center.    The Program Manager recommends
              Northeastern University be awarded  $100,000 for the first year of a three-year
              continuing award.  An  additional $15,000 is recommended for one year with
              funds provided  by the U.S. Department of Army Natick RD&E Center.    Near the
              end of each 12-month period, the Program Manager will  review the progress of
              the Center on a number of renewal criteria,  includ ing the following:  1) the
              extent to which the  university/industry interaction is being sustained and
              growing; 2)  the extent to which the support base of $100,000 is met and 
              expanded; and 3) the extent to which a robust educational program  is
              developing.  If the review is satisfactory, the Program Manager  will recommend
              support for the next year.  The total amount of this  three year continuing
              award is $300,000.
