Abstract    :
              9419541  Schwartz    The Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for
              Aseptic  Processing and Packaging Studies is becoming a multi-university 
              Center with the addition of the University of California - Davis to  the
              original North Carolina State University research group.  Four new companies
              are joining the Center inconjunction with the  University of California - Davis
              research site.  Seven companies  are already members of the initial Center.   
              A woman undergraduate is also being funded for a study to determine  the
              hydrocolloid - protein interactions in vitro.    The researchers are eminently
              qualified for this research.    The Center has been coordinated with Dr. Fred
              Heineken, Program  Director in the Division of Bioengineering and Environmental
               Systems.    The Program Manager recommends North Carolina State University be 
              awarded $5,000 for the first year of a five-year continuing award.   An
              additional $5,000 is recommended for one year with funds  provided by the
              Women, Minorities, and Disabled Engineering  Research Assistants Program. 
              Funding for years two through five of  the five year continuing award are
              recommended at $30,000 per year  including $5,000 per year for an evaluator.   
              Near the end of each 12-month period the Program Manager and/or the  Division
              Director of the Engineering Education Centers Division  will review the
              progress of the Center on a number of renewal  criteria requirements, including
              the following:  1) the extent to  which the industry/university interaction is
              developing; 2) the  extent to which the support base is developing; and 3) the
              extent  to which a robust research program is developing.  If the review is 
              satisfactory, the Program Manager will recommend support for the  next period
              of this continuing award.
