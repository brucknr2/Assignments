Abstract    :
              Jameson/Abstract  ATM-9419523         The objectives of this research are: (1) 
              to validate recent  advances in radar techniques for estimating the rainfall
              rate (R)  and rain water content (W) by comparing independent estimates of R, 
              W and the mass weighted mean drop diameter Dm computed using VHF  (and
              sometimes coincident UHF) profiler measurements of the drop  size distribution
              to simultaneous estimates in the same sampling  volumes calculated using
              measurements form the Bureau of  Meteorological Research Centre (BMRC) C-band
              polarization radar  located near Darwin, Australia;  (2) to explore the merit
              of using  measurements of the differential phase between horizontal and 
              vertical polarizations to correct for the effects of attenuation on  C-band
              radar power measurements, to compare theoretical and  experimental relations
              between the specific differential phase and  attenuation coefficients, and to
              look for the effect of cloud  attenuation by using C-ban polarization radar
              measurements in  storms near Darwin.
