Abstract    :
              9419528  Heckman  The research proposed in this application concerns a
              quantitative  understanding of the dynamics of skeletal muscle.  The project 
              has two major objectives: (1) to continue the development of a  model of muscle
              firmly based on biophysics and biochemistry, and  (2) to test and validate the
              model in carefully controlled animal  experiments.  The model is a mathematical
              approximation to A.F.  Huxley's biophysical cross-bridge theory of contraction.
               Current  models for a most important element of the neuromuscular control 
              system-its actuator, skeletal muscle-have tended to be rather  crude
              viscoelastic analogies with only the most tenuous  connection to modern
              biological concepts about how the muscle  works.  A state-variable model of a
              skeletal muscle fiber as a  direct mathematical approximation to biophysical
              cross-bridge  models of the type introduced by A.F. Huxley will continue to be 
              developed in this project.  This model is call the Distributed-  Moment Model
              of muscle because it emphasizes the important role  of the moments of the
              actin-myosin bond-distribution function.  These moments have macroscopic
              interpretations as muscle  stiffness, force, and elastic energy.  Thus it is of
              particular  significance that this model establishes a direct connection 
              between the macroscopic behavior of muscle and contractile  mechanisms believed
              to be operating at the molecular level.  The  project is a joint effort with
              Heckman at Northwestern University  (grant number 9318631).  ***
