Abstract    :
              9419267  Kyle and Aster    Abstract    This award supports continuation of the
              Mount Erebus Volcano  Observatory.  The principal objectives are to continue
              year-round  surveillance of the volcanic activity of Mount Erebus, using a 
              network of 7 seismic stations and gas monitoring during summer  months. The
              seismicity will provide an understanding of the  eruptive behavior and dynamics
              of Mt. Erebus.  Inversion of the  seismic data in future may allow tomographic
              imaging of the magma  chamber and plumbing inside the volcano.  During the
              austral  summer months, field based observations will include measuring 
              emission rates of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and trace gases and  metals.  These data
              will be used to evaluate the potential impact  of gas emission from Erebus on
              the snow chemistry on the East  Antarctic Ice Sheet.  Short term variations in
              the emission rates  of F, Cl, SO2 and metals will be examined to infer volatile
               zoning in the magma chamber supplying the lava lake.  A separate  program of
              radiometric dating using the high precision 40Ar/39Ar  method will be
              coordinated with this work to determine the  geological evolution of the
              volcano and to examine eruption rates  of anorthoclase phonolite lavas from Mt.
              Erebus.
