Abstract    :

                                                             GRIMM    Fire is an important
              component of the functioning of ecosystems. Fire also is currently being used
              extensively by human populations worldwide in the conversion of forest to
              pasture and agricultural land. The historic role of fire and the frequency of
              fire in different ecosystem types is important in assessing present-day
              management decisions. This project looks at 6,000 years of fire history in
              changing landscapes of the boreal forests and grasslands of North America.
              Pollen records and charcoal records will be combined to examine interplay
              between vegetation and fire. This will provide a comparison of how modern
              emissions from modern fires differ from those of the past.    This research is
              important because it places the role of fire in a regional perspective. Methods
              are to be developed and tested which will allow fire history from individual
              lakes to be extended to a regional view of how fire structures and affects
              ecosystems.
