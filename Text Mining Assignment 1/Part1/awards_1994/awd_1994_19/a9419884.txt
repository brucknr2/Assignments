Abstract    :
              Willis  9419884   Little is known about the genetic basis in plants of
              inbreeding depression, the decreased success, or fitness, of inbred offspring
              when compared to offspring produced by cross-fertilization.  The objective of
              the proposed research is to experimentally analyze the genetics of inbreeding
              depression in the monkey flower, Mimulus guttatus.  The primary goals are to
              determine 1) the relative contribution of major and minor harmful mutations to
              inbreeding depression, 2) the effects of these mutations on other components of
              an organism's fitness, and 3) the average degree of dominance of minor harmful
              mutations.   The results of this research will provide important information on
              how inbreeding depression is purged by self-fertilization and will help explain
              how selfing evolves in spite of apparently strong selection against it.  The
              results also will aid in the breeding of economically important varieties of
              plants and animals that experience inbreeding depression and in the
              conservation of rare and endangered species.
