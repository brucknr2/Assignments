Abstract    :
              Fire is an important component of the functioning of ecosystems. Fire also is
              currently being  used extensively by human populations worldwide in the
              conversion of forest to pasture and  agricultural land. The historic role of
              fire and the frequency of fire in different ecosystem types is  important in
              assessing present-day management decisions. This project looks at 6,000 years
              of fire  history in changing landscapes of the boreal forests and grasslands of
              North America. Pollen records  and charcoal records will be combined to examine
              interplay between vegetation and fire. This will  provide a comparison of how
              modern emissions from modern fires differ from those of the past.  This 
              research is important because it places the role of fire in a regional
              perspective. Methods are to be  developed and tested which will allow fire
              history from individual lakes to be extended to a regional  view of how fire
              structures and affects ecosystems.
