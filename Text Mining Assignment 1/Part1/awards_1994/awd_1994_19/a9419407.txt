Abstract    :
                                                9419407  James Hanken    The  ultimate goal of
              this research project is to understand  the developmental basis of anatomical
              differences in anatomy  of  the  head among species.  The studies focus on a 
              unique  population  of  cells--the  neural  crest--from  which  many  cranial 
              tissues in vertebrates are derived.   The  specific  contributions of neural
              crest cells to the skull and cranial  musculature  in  different  species  will
               be  assessed   by  labeling  these  cells  with  a  fluorescent  dye  early 
              in  development,  before  they begin to migrate  throughout  the  body,  and 
              tracking  their movement to  see  which  cranial  tissues  are  derived from
              the labeled cells.  The  research  will  also determine whether neural crest
              cells contain  the  developmental information that is responsible for
              anatomical  differences  among species and document the place  and  time 
              during  development  where genes are  expressed  that  might  mediate  the 
              development and adult fates  of  neural  crest  cells.   The  research will
              increase our  knowledge  of  the  genetic   and   developmental  mechanisms  
              underlying   the  integrated evolution of complex anatomical structures.
