Abstract    :
              9419018  Leeman  This study addresses the relation between tectonic evolution of
              the Pacific Northwest and geochemical evolution of the mantle below the
              Cascadia volcanic arc.  Cascade volcanism began at about 40 Ma following
              collision of a seamount/oceanic island chain (Oregon-Washington coast ranges)
              with the Paleogene subduction zone westward migration of subduction to its
              present location shortly after this event.  Between that time and the present,
              there was a five-fold decrease in convergence rate as well as a systematic
              decrease in the age of the subducting plate as the Juan de Fuca ridge system
              approached the mainland.  These variations should have resulted in progressive
              and predictable modifications of the subarc mantle.  It is planned to test this
              subduction model in two ways:  First the P.I.s plan to characterize the major
              and trace element and isotopic compositions of primitive pre-Quaternary lavas
              erupted throughout the history of the arc.  this will be done in two temporal
              transects across the Cascade range where exposures are optimal and geologic
              mapping is available.  Second, the P.I.s plan to complete a detailed petrologic
              study of variably metasomatized mantle xenoliths from the southern Washington
              Cascades.  Some of these rocks have been strikingly modified by infiltrating
              potassic siliceous melts and CO2-rich fluids.  Given the range of lithologies
              available, and assuming that the original lithosphere was oceanic, it will be
              possible to document directly certain aspects of subduction-related mass
              transfer fluxes.  The mineral chemistry, textures, and fluid and melt inclusion
              characteristics of the xenoliths suite will be thoroughly documented to
              constrain the petrologic evolution of a portion of the subarc mantle.
