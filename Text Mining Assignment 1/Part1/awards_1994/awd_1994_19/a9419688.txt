Abstract    :
              9419688  Williams  This  symposium entitled "Materials Research at the
              Crossroads of Physical  and  Solid-State Chemistry" is being organized by the
              Physical Chemistry Division of  the  American Chemical Society to develop,
              integrate, and apply new  approaches  in   the   classical  disciplines  to 
              issues  of  broader  scope  within   the  solid-state/materials  chemical
              communities. To our knowledge,  there  has  not  been  a  similarly structured
              meeting or symposium offered previously, although  specific  topics  have  been
              discussed at meetings of  the  Materials  Research  Society, the Gordon
              Research Conferences, and the Materials Physics section  of  the American
              Physical Society. This symposium is unique in that it addresses  a  broader 
              range of materials types within one symposium, addresses  primarily  a 
              chemical audience, and finds common themes in the manner in which materials are
               designed, synthesized, and characterized.  ***
