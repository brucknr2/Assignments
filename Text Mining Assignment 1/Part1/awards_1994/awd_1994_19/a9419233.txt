Abstract    :
              9419233  Carlis    Many of the observations made by brain scientists, from
              molecular physiology to behavior, can only be understood when they are placed
              within the context of the brain's anatomical structure.  With this award, a
              group of computer scientists  and neurobiologists, headed by Dr. John Carlis,
              will design a prototype architecture for storing high resolution images of
              brain structure.  These images will be organized (1) so that they can be viewed
              globally, but also so that the operator can zoom in on very fine details, and
              (2) they will be organized as network accessible files so that they can be
              shared over the internet.  This work will advance the emerging field of
              bioinformatics and will improve the ways in which scientists store, share, and
              analyze experimental data about the brain.
