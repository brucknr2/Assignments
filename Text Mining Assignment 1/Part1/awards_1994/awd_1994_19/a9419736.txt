Abstract    :
              Funds for the purchase of High Performance Liquid  Chromatography (HPLC)
              instrumentation are sought.  Detectors  (photodiode array, electrochemical,
              conductivity and  refractive index), associate modules, a computer, software, 
              and a printer would be used with existing HPLC pumps and  autosampler.  The
              combined instruments would be shared by  eight researchers.  Their applications
              are (1) sugars and  water soluble vitamins in glandular secretions produced by 
              honey bees; chemical residues in honey bee products; (2)  plant nonstructural 
              carbohydrates, proline, ions and  annonaceous acetogenins in pawpaw tissue; (3)
              azadirachtin  residues in stored corn; (4) 17-methyltestosterone in  paddlefish
              tissues; (5) inorganic ions in water and  wastewater; (6) pesticide residues in
              turnips and other crop  plants; (7) plant growth hormones in pine seedlings,
              and the  relationship of flavor-producing chemicals to spectra of  light
              reflected onto horticultural crops; and (8) vitamins  in fish feed.  High
              school, undergraduate, and graduate  school students are active in the
              laboratories of the  researchers involved with this proposal.  Kentucky State 
              University is a historically black institution with a large  enrollment of
              minority students.
