Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support for a Keystone Symposium,  Frontiers of Plant
              Morphogenesis, to be held at Hilton Head  Island, South Carolina, from March 29
              through April 4, 1995.  The meeting will be held concurrently with another
              Keystone  Symposium, Signal Transduction in Plants, and there will be  two
              joint plenary sessions that will bring together both  groups of scientists for
              discussion of topics of mutual  interest.  The area of plant development is
              tremendously  diverse; however with the acquisition of modern cellular and 
              molecular information, common themes are beginning to  emerge.  It is therefore
              essential, at this time, that  workers in traditionally diverse areas be
              apprised of recent  advances in order for new syntheses to be developed.  To 
              date, there has not been a meeting that has concentrated on  bringing cell and
              molecular biologists together for the sole  intent of presenting and discussing
              problems in  morphogenesis.  This is the first meeting that will bring 
              together workers who are interested in understanding how  gene expression
              affects, and is affected by, second  messengers; how this information is
              translated by the  cytoskeleton into positional information; and how the wall 
              components, in turn, cue this positional data to define the  morphology of
              plant cells which ultimately defines the  overall shape of the plant.
