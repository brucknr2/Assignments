Abstract    :
              This researches the numerical modeling of gravity wave breaking and 
              instability, wave transports of energy and momentum, wave spectral  evolution,
              and the generation and evolution of, and mixing induced  by, wave-generated
              turbulence.  Wave influences in the atmosphere,  only qualitatively understood,
              can only be addressed in a  comprehensive manner using numerical techniques
              because of the  complexity (and nonlinearity) of the important interactions. 
              The  proposed studies will also identify the processes that act most  strongly
              to control the spectral evolution of the wave field and  assess the validity of
              the various theories that have been advanced  to account for the observed
              spectral behavior with altitude.
