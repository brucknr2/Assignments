Abstract    :
              9419142  Lay   This award provides partial funding for a technical support
              position in the Institute of Tectonics and the Earth Sciences Board at the
              University of California, Santa Cruz. The primary impact of the position
              (Computer Systems Manager) will be on computer-intensive geophysics research
              programs in the Crustal Imaging Laboratory, the W.M. Keck Seismological
              Laboratory, and the Earth Sciences Visualization Laboratory, all of which are
              maintained by the Systems Manager.   ***
