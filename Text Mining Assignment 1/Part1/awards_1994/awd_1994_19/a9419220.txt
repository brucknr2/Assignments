Abstract    :
              9419220  Troland    Dr. Richard Crutcher, at the University of Illinois, and Dr.
              Thomas Troland, at  the University of Kentucky, are continuing a long term
              collaborative project  to observe the properties of magnetic fields in
              molecular clouds in the  interstellar medium.  The major effort will be to
              measure magnetic field  strengths using the Zeeman effect.  The observations
              will be interpreted by  detailed comparison with theoretical models of the
              structure and dynamics of  dense clouds.  As a result, in the next few years
              one can expect a major  expansion in our empirical knowledge of magnetic fields
              in dense clouds and  their role in the fundamental astrophysical problem of
              star formation.
