Abstract    :
              NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY    Creel, Scott., IBN 94-19452    Mechanisms and Evolution
              of Reproductive Suppression    This project will continue a study of African
              wild dogs  (Lycaon pictus). begun June 1991 in Tanzania s Selous Game  Reserve.
               African wild dogs are an endangered species.  Estimates of the number living
              in the wild range from 4000  to 6000.  The Selous Game Reserve is the largest
              protected  area on the continent, and holds the largest remaining  population
              of wild dogs (880 individuals).  This research is  part of a larger program to
              understand and reverse the wild  dogs  decline.  Within a typical wild dog pack
              (of up to 20  adults), only the socially dominant pair breeds.  This study 
              will address the question of why social subordinates do not  breed, even though
              they are reproductively mature..  Two  approaches will be used.  First,
              demographic and genetic  data will be gathered to test a mathematical model of
              the  evolution of reproductive suppression.  Second, behavioral  and hormonal
              data will be collected in the wild, to  determine what physiological and
              behavioral mechanisms  prevent reproduction by subordinates.  This research 
              addresses two issues of broad significance.  First, it  examines the manner in
              which social status affects  reproduction (an issue with direct relevance for
              human  reproduction, and for captive breeding of other endangered  species). 
              Second, it examines the causes of decline of an  endangered animal, in the hope
              of ensuring its survival in  the wild.
