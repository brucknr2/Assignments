Abstract    :
              9419171  Seidman    The focus of this research is the structure and properties 
              of interfaces in metals .  A number of issues related to  grain boundaries (GB)
              are being studied, including: factors  affecting the presence and scale of GB
              faceting; kinetics of  GB phase transitions; macroscopic and atomistic
              mechanisms  of GB phase transitions; and scaling, e.g., the existance of 
              fractal-type facet morphologies.  These subjects are  examined by growing
              specific grain boundaries and facet  morphologies and studying them in situ by
              hot stage  transmission electron microscopy.  Atom probe techniques are  used
              to study the kinetics of dissolution of selected binary  substems.  %%%  The
              subjects of this research are timely: grain boundary  segregation and phase
              transition issues are long standing  scientific problems and the boron-doped
              and boron-free  nickel aluminides are curently of high technological  interest.
