Abstract    :
              9419600  Robertson  This proposal is to develop a prototype network and 
              associated databases to link engineers using modern  communication technology. 
              This project will use the World  Wide Web with a dedicated server to access the
              relevant  databases.    This facility will be used initially by the engineering
               community in connection with sustainable development  activities in the United
              States and in Latin America.  It  will enable that community to collaborate on
              problems of the  environment and engineering in a manner not now possible. 
              After being demonstrated, and using the World Wide Web, it  will be possible
              for engineers throughout the world to  collaborate on sustainable development
              and related issues  with improved ease.  ***
