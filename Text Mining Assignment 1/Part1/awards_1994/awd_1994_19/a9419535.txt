Abstract    :
              9419535  Suomi       The objective of this research is the testing of a new
              in-situ  ocean hat flux instrument designed to measure the heat flux in the 
              molecular conduction layer near the water surface; thus,it measures  the
              combined heat loss owing to evaporation, sensible transport and  radiation. 
              The device can be deployed on either drifting or  tethered buoys.       The
              proposed tests, in cooperation with Professor Gabler,  University of Miami,
              include comparisons between the flux plate and  eddy correlation devices
              installed in salt water near Miami, These  tests should establish the merit of
              the heat flux plate, its design  limitation, if any, and perhaps preferred ways
              to deploy the device  at sea.    ***
