Abstract    :
              9419962  Isbell  This award supports a project to investigate the Upper 
              Carboniferous (?) and Permian glacial diamictite, basinal shale,  and fluvial
              coal-bearing strata in the central Transantarctic  Mountains that accumulated
              in a major sedimentary basin that  formed along the Paleo-Pacific margin of
              Gondwana.  The basin  contains 1.5 km of upper Paleozoic strata.  At the time
              these  rocks were deposited, Antarctica was centrally located within the 
              Gondwana continent, and occupied a position near the Permian  South Pole. 
              Glacial deposits suggest conditions similar to the  present.  Within
              post-glacial strata, coal, fossil plants, and  the deposits of large prograding
              clastic wedges record a dramatic  change in  climatic and tectonic conditions. 
              Although Upper  Carboniferous and Permian rocks in the central Transantarctic 
              Mountains contain an abundance of information, they are primarily  nonmarine
              and lack invertebrate fossils.  Due to a present lack  of time control within
              these strata, the basin's geologic history  consists of numerous local mosaics.
               Until time control is  obtained, the significance of events recorded within
              these local  sections will remain  speculative.  This study will examine Upper 
              Carboniferous (?) and Permian strata in the Shackleton Glacier  area in order
              to establish time control within the depositional  basin.  Sequence
              stratigraphic techniques, along with palynomorph  analysis, will be applied to
              the study of these rocks.  These  tools will help to constrain the location and
              timing of  regionally significant depositional, climatic, tectonic, and 
              paleoecologic events within Antarctica.
