Abstract    :
                This project involves the dissertation research of a student of cultural
              anthropology from Washington University, St. Louis.  The project is to study
              the evolving process by which tribal farmers in a rural area of Madagascar
              defend their claims to farmland in a forested area where the federal government
              and international NGOs hope to establish a wildlife preserve.  Using
              ethnographic techniques of intensive interviewing about life histories and
              family histories, coupled with a survey of an entire representative village and
              a set of  intensive interviews on land conflicts, the student will test the
              proposition that wealthier villagers, who will tend to have been earlier
              settlers and control more land, can more successfully contest the government's
              definition of rights to land and affect the evolving social norms in their
              communities.  This research is important because land reform, the protection of
              forested areas, and the migration of poor farmers to new agricultural zones are
              global processes taking place all over the developing world.  Advances in our
              understanding of how land use rights become established and accepted by local
              communities will help planners design more effective programs to defend
              wildlife areas from encroachment.  In addition this project will train a
              scholar in the culture and ecology of this part of the world.
