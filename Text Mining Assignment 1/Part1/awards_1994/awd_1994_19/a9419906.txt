Abstract    :
              Abstract  AST-9419906  Helfand, David J.  Collaborative Project: The FIRST
              Survey: Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-cm.  Dr. Robert Becker, at the
              University of California at Davis, and Dr. David Helfand, at Columbia
              University, will collaborate on a project to carry out a survey known as FIRST
              Survey:  Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-cm. The survey will be done
              with the Very Large Array (VLA) of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory at
              a wavelength of twenty centimeters.  A catalog of over one million radio
              sources, each with position accurate enough to allow unambiguous identification
              of their optical counterparts, will be derived from the data.  FIRST will
              provide a fundamental resource for the world-wide astronomical community. ***
