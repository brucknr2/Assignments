Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9419513  Bala Subramaniam  Travel of  Dr. Bala Subramaniam to
              attend the Sixth International Symposium on Catalyst Deactivation to be held in
              Oostende, Belgium, on October 3-5, 1994.  At the meeting he will report on his
              work on the use of  supercritical media to control coking in reforming
              operations.  This effort was supported initially by an Engineering Research
              Initiation Grant and later by NSF's EPSCoR program and the State of Kansas
              EPSCoR.  This represents a successful effort for both the RIG and The EPSCoR
              program and  deserves to be presented before an international audience.
