Abstract    :
              9419690  Whittet    Dr. Whittet will use this small grant for exploratory
              research to  examine a new interpretation of interstellar extinction data.  The
               PI has the opportunity to use groundbased and satellite data bases  (mostly
              archival) to better understand extinction curves, to  attempt to explain
              previously puzzling results, and thus to  formulate a more complete and
              realistic model.
