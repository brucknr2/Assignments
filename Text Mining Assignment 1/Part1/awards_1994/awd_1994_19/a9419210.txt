Abstract    :
              9419210  Bowring      This grant provides partial support for the costs  of
              acquiring an inductively coupled plasma mass  spectrometer (ICP-MS) to augment
              to replace a  first generation ICP-MS that is both outdated in  terms of its
              detection limits for elements with  high mass numbers (+80) and has an
              unreliable  service record.  The new instrument will be housed  in the center
              for geochemical analyses at MIT  where abundant technical support is available.
               This instrument will allow the PI's to conduct  high-resolution,
              state-of-the-art measurements of  Uranium series isotopic ratios in corals for 
              studies in paleooceanography and allow rapid and  precise determination of rare
              earth element (REE)  concentrations in the dissolved and suspended  loads of
              riverine waters as a proxy for weathering  intensity.  ***
