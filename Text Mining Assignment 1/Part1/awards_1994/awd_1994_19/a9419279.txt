Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT      9419279  Readhead, A.C.S.    Observations of the Microwave
              Background Radiation provide information which is crucial to theories of the
              formation of large-scale structure in the Universe.  The extremely low level of
              anisotropy observed in the microwave background radiation has focused attention
              on theories of structure formation which propose that the dominant matter
              content of the Universe is in the form of non-baryonic matter.  The questions
              of the dominant matter content of the Universe and the formation of structure
              in the Universe are fundamental and are amongst the most important questions in
              cosmology.    Dr. Readhead and colleagues at Cal Tech will examine the
              anisotropy of the background radiation on angular scales from 2 to 20
              arcminutes using radio wavelength telescopes at the Owens Valley Radio
              Observatory.  Additional observations will be carried out to study the
              Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect -- the scattering of microwave background radiation
              photons by the hot electron gas in galaxy clusters.  ***
