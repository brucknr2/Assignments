Abstract    :
              9419529  Etler    This award provides support for a postdoctoral fellowship for 
              Dennis Etler to conduct paleoanthropological research in China on  important
              human fossil discoveries at the Yunxian site.  This  research is expected to
              contribute to improved understanding of  the evolution of early man in China. 
              The research will be  conducted in collaboration with the Hubei Archaeological 
              Institute, Wuhan, China.    Initial work at the Yunxian site suggest that the
              fossil human  skulls found at the site are very old, perhaps in excess of 
              780,000 years old.  They are the most complete crania of such  great antiquity
              found to date on the Asian mainland and will  undoubtedly be the subject of
              wide-ranging discussions in  paleoanthropological and archaeological circles
              for years to  come.  This postdoctoral fellowship should pave the way for a 
              larger interdisciplinary effort and provide important access for  U.S.
              researchers to this site in the future.
