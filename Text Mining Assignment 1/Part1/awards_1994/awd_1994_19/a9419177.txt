Abstract    :
              9419177  Haws  Experiments and computations  can generate vast quantities of 
              numerical data which are difficult to interpret.  Visualization  techniques are
              increasingly being applied by researchers to  assist in this; for example to
              assist the researcher to discover  basic phenomena normally masked within these
              large numerical data  sets.  While excellent visualization tools exist and are
              being  developed, there is little knowledge or use of these tools by 
              researchers in geotechnical earthquake engineering.    The objective of this
              project is to introduce researchers and  practitioners in earthquake
              engineering to the wide variety of  visualization tools available today. 
              Proper use of these tools  requires understanding simple concepts (such as the
              basic  principles of visual perception) as well as existing industry  standards
              (such as broadcast video formats for displaying  information).  This workshop
              will emphasize the use of  inexpensive (that is, microcomputer-based) computer
              platforms  with a "hands-on" approach, and will include appropriate 
              documentation and dissemination of the workshop materials to  those who are not
              able to attend.    It is expected that the use of these visualization tools
              will  lead to improved earthquake hazard mitigation techniques.  ***
