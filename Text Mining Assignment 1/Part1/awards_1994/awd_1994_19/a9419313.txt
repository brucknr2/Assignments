Abstract    :
              This project involves the development of an Applied mathematics Laboratory which
              will provide  a new experience in the education and training of applied
              mathematics graduate students.   Sophisticated experiments and mathematical
              modeling are combined in a way that not only  teaches good mathematical
              modeling are combined in a way that not only teaches good  mathematics but also
              helps the students develop critical professional skills.  Unlike may class- 
              room courses in mathematical modeling, in which problems are often studied in a
              way that is  isolated from their physical origins, the proposed laboratory
              builds and examines models through  hands on experimental work at a rather
              advanced level.  this approach develops and sharpens a  students intuition in a
              way that only direct observation can.  In addition to the purely scientific 
              content of the class the laboratory is designed to mature the students
              intellectually by exposing  them to experiences that will teach them to think,
              compute, work as a team, communicate and  prioritize.  These are precisely the
              qualities that are sought by today's employers and that will be  expected of
              graduates in the work place.
