Abstract    :
              9419277  Davis   This award provides partial funding (33% of total cost) for the
              acquisition of a scanning electron microscope system to be installed and
              operated in the Department of Geophysical Sciences at the University of
              Chicago. The institution is committed to matching funds for one-third of the
              costs and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration will provide the
              remaining one-third of the funding needed. The new capabilities of a modern
              scanning electron microscope will be used to benefit research and education in
              the areas of  mineral physics, paleontology, stratigraphy, igneous and
              metamorphic petrology, geochemistry, cosmochemistry, interstellar grain
              studies, and studies of the origin of the elements.  ***
