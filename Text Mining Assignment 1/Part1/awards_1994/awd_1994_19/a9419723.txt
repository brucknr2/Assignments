Abstract    :
              9419723  TYLER  The Acoelomorpha is a group of worms of comparatively simple
              structure, and, accordingly, some biologists consider them to represent the
              most basic form of all multicellular animals.  Acoelomorphs digest their food
              with a multinucleate mass of tissue instead of in the lumen or cavity of a gut,
              and their nervous system is only loosely organized into concentrations that
              could be compared to the brain and nerve cords of other animals.  Taxonomists
              divide the group into 17 families, largely on the basis of the structure of the
              reproductive organs, but have fallen short of explaining how these families
              relate to each other or to other animal groups, including other flatworms.  To
              better understand how these basic animal forms fit into the system of lower
              animals, members of the Acoelomorpha and other invertebrates believed to be
              related with electron and fluorescence microscopy, specifically looking at the
              musculature of the body wall and reproductive organs and the fine structure of
              the complexes of glands and sensory organs in the head.  The characters
              discerned through this examination will then be applied to reconstructing
              relationships among acoelomorph families and relationships of acoelomorphs to
              other lower invertebrate groups.  The ultimate goal of this research is to
              understand the causes of the diversity of these lower worms.  %%%  This study
              will contribute to our understanding of the relationships of a very "primitive"
              or simple group of animals and will help clarify or explain radiations of many
              groups in the animal diversity of the earth.  ***
