Abstract    :
              9419850  Kingsolver    Some   insect  species  accumulate  distasteful   or  
              toxic  chemicals to deter potential predators, while others rely on  speed   or
                manuverability  to   escape.    Palatable   and  distasteful  butterfly
              species tend to differ  in  body  and  wing  shape, flight speed and flight
              manuverability, but  it  is  unclear  how these characters are interrelated 
              and  how  they  affect vulnerability to predation.  This research will  use 
              experimental manipulations of the  distribution of body  weight  to  test
              hypotheses about how body weight  and  body  shape  determines flight and
              survival under  lab  and  field  conditions  in  both palatable and unpalatable
               butterflies.  One  of the study species is an important agricultural pest. 
              The  research will provide an experimental case study of the  targets and
              mechanisms of natural selection that operate  on  flight and dispersal in
              insects.
