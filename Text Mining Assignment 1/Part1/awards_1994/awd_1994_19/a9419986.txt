Abstract    :
              NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY    Capaldi, IBN 94-19986,   Stimulus selection effects in 
              conditioned preferences and aversions       Many organisms, including humans,
              have strong food  preferences and aversions which are important influences on 
              diet.  Most of these preferences and aversions are learned.  The mechanisms
              involved in this learning are quite complex,  involving both the sensory
              qualities (taste and odor) and  the dietary value of the food.  For example,
              rats can learn  to prefer an arbitrary flavor (such as unsweetened cinnamon) 
              if it is associated with a food that has either calories or  a good taste (such
              as sugar). Previous work has suggested  that tastes are more easily learned as
              the basis for  aversions while odors are more easily the basis for learned 
              preferences.  Capaldi will carry out a series of experiments  which will
              investigate the relationships between preferences  and aversions on the one
              hand and odor and taste on the  other in an attempt to determine why this might
              be the case.  The results will reveal new information about learned food 
              preferences and aversions, with important implications for  both general
              learning theory and the understanding of the  origins of human food choice.
