Abstract    :
              In order to understand the possible functions of  ultraviolet-(UV) and
              polarization-vision in animals, it  is necessary to be able to view and measure
              these  environmental parameters.  Since we  are  functionally  blind  to these
              aspects of  the photic environment, we  must depend on instrumentation such as 
              spectroradiometers and cameras for visualization.  It  is also necessary that
              we understand how these  environmental parameters vary with time as many
              animals  gain and lose these visual sensitivities with age.    This project
              will provide two new instruments for the  study of W and polarization vision. 
              The first is a  photographic camera-based spectroradiometer which will  allow
              for unattended, long-term monitoring of the solar  spectrum from 300 nm to 700
              nm. The second is an  imaging polarimeter based on modifications to a 
              three-tube colour television camera.  This camera is  already being used for
              multispectral imaging in the  visible and UV, and the addition of polarization 
              imaging will greatly enhance its utility.    The information gained using these
              instruments will  greatly enhance our understanding of why animals have 
              evolved UV and polarization visual capabilities.  The  imaging polarimeter will
              also determine the  polarization c haracteristics of relevant visual  targets,
              such as planktonic prey, for which UV  information is available.
