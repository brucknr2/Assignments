Abstract    :
              9419328  Young  Partial support will be provided for the U.S. Delegate to the 
              Council of the International Arctic Science Committee (IASC) which  serves as
              the principal international organization responsible for  coordinating
              international scientific research and related  scientific programs and
              activities dealing with the full range  of Arctic issues.  IASC is charged with
              developing and coordinating  international multidisciplinary Arctic scientific
              research  programs, especially those requiring collaboration between the 
              natural and social sciences and the IASC Council meets annually to  oversee
              IASC activities.  The U.S. Delegate to the IASC Council  works closely with the
              U.S. National Committee for IASC and  interested Federal agencies to assure
              that U.S. Arctic science  interests are effectively represented in IASC.  This
              support will  cover partial costs of the Delegate's participation in IASC; a 
              small U.S. contribution to the central operating costs of IASC; and  the
              publication of an IASC report on global change in the Arctic.
