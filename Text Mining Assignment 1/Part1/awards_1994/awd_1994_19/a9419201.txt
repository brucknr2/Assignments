Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9419201  K. Dozier    Funding is provided for partial support of a
              joint research-educational project between CSULA and Hughes Aircraft.  Dr.
              David Chang, Director of Technology Transfer at Hughes, will spend one day per
              week at CSULA and will interact with students and faculty.  The objectives are:
               (1) Catalyze university-industry collaborative research projects; (2) Promote
              student involvement in research and design of relevance to industry; (3)
              Improve the infrastructure laboratory on campus.    Four projects will be
              initiated:  (a) An optics gyroscope analysis for automotive applications also
              supported by a TRP/ARPA grant); (b) An interactive learning at distance via a
              satellite network; (c) Training for clean manufacturing technology program,
              including technology transfer to other companies; (d) Damping of waves in
              shallow water for two-phase flow air cleaning fountains on the California
              shore.  The last project will make use of a patent application for using wave
              energy to create the fountains.  At least three students  will be placed to
              temporarily work in Hughes.  The visit of Dr. Chang on campus will also
              facilitate the design of a optics sensor and communication laboratory in CSULA.
                 This is an experimental CRISP (Combined Research Industrial Scholarship
              Project, GOAL Announcement 93-149), where the industrial partner comes on the
              University campus to forge the university-industry interaction.    CSULA is a
              minority institution, and Hughes plan to encourage recruiting of minority
              graduates.    It is expected that the proposed project will have a significant
              impact on developing the curriculum and attracting students to industry at
              CSULA, initiating several joint research projects of relevance for industry,
              and enhancing the infrastructure at CSULA.
