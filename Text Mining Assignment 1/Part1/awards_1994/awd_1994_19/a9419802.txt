Abstract    :
              9419802  Archibald   This taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional studies of
              fossil walruses (Odobenidae sensu Demere) will focus on exceptionally well
              preserved and systematically informative skeletal material from the Emlong
              Collection (USNM, Smithsonian Institution).  Specific objectives of this study
              are: (1) to document obobenid diversity from the early Miocene through the
              Pliocene (17-3 million years ago), (2) to evaluate the systematic relationships
              of these Neogene odobenids that are especially critical to walrus phylogeny,
              and (3) to use this phylogenetic framework to investigate adaptation of feeding
              strategies and locomotor patterns among odobenids and related pinnipeds (seals
              and sea lions).
