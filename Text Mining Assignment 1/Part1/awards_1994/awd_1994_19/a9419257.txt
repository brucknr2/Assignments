Abstract    :
              DMR-9419257  Marchetti  This project addresses several theoretical aspects of 
              nonequilibrium superconductivity and nonlinear collective  transport.  Vortex
              arrays pinned by extended defects, such  as twin boundaries, are studied.  The
              hydrodynamics of flux-  line liquids will be derived and applied.  Specific
              models  for flux lattices are studied to understand the general  features of
              collective nonlinear dynamics and transport in  driven disordered systems. 
              Also, the dynamics of  topological defects produced when a systems is quenched
              from  a disordered to an ordered phase across a symmetry breaking  transition
              is also included as a new direction of research.  %%%  This project concerns,
              in part, a theoretical analysis of  arrays of linear defects found in high
              temperature  superconductors.  This understanding should contribute to  the
              goal of controlling the energy loss present in a variety  of applications of
              these materials.  The study of these  defects and how they move should also
              have applications to  other classes of materials which are currently of
              interest  in the laboratory.  A close collaboration with  experimentalists and
              theorists at Argonne National  laboratory is planned as part of this work.
