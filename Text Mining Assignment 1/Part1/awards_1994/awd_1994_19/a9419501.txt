Abstract    :
                94-19501  Johnson  This award by NSF will support laboratory measurements of 
              sputtering from surfaces of a range of materials.  Sputtering from  these
              materials simulates similar processes, induced by UV  radiation, electrons, and
              ions, on the surfaces of small and large  bodies in the outer solar system (in
              particular, comets,  satellites, planetary rings). Effects of thermal
              sublimation rates  of the irradiated samples will also be studied.    The
              research, which includes numerical modeling to interpret  the laboratory
              measurements, is expected to lead to an improved  understanding of the physical
              and chemical changes caused by  sputtering.  This understanding will be crucial
              for interpreting  observational data of bodies in the solar system as well as
              of the  interstellar medium (i.e., interstellar grains).    It is expected that
              the research will be exceptionally productive  because of the investigators'
              skills and outstanding past  performance, their state-of-the-art laboratory
              facility, and the  current dearth of reliable data in this research area.
