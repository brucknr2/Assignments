Abstract    :
              We request funds for growth chambers and a mass spectrometer  to conduct
              isotopic tracer studies of ecosystem processes.  In variety of ecosystems
              including arctic tundra, California  grassland, tropical forests, and temperate
              and tropical  agricultural systems, we will be using 15N and 13C to study  a
              carbon and nitrogen fluxes through ecosystems.  The  research emphasizes the
              mechanisms of interaction between  carbon and micro-organisms, and the controls
              over trace gas  fluxes which are involved in greenhouse warming and climate 
              change.
