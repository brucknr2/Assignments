Abstract    :
              9419128  Stearns  This is a project to maintain and augment as necessary, the 
              network   of   nearly  fifty  automatic  weather   stations  established  on 
              the  Antarctic continent  and  on  several  surrounding   islands.   These 
              weather  stations   measure  surface wind, pressure, temperature, humidity, and
              in  some  instances  other  atmospheric  variables,  such   as   snow 
              accumulation and incident solar radiation, and report these  via satellite to a
              number of ground stations.  The data are  used for operational weather
              forecasting in support of  the  United   States   Antarctic  program,  for  
              climatological  records, and for research purposes.  The AWS network, which 
              began  as a small-scale program in 1980, has been extremely  reliable  and has
              proven indispensable for both forecasting  and research purposes.  ***
