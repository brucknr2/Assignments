Abstract    :
              Abstract                                      DMR-94 14268    This   research 
              will  focus  on  the  rapid  and  large-scale   formation   of 
              polymer-containing    layered   composites   by   exfoliation-adsorption    and
               colloid-emulsion  reactions. Properties to be explored  using  techniques 
              that  include   electron  microscopy,  x-ray  diffraction,  and  scanning  
              tunneling  microscopy  are  those  that  are  governed by the  polymer 
              functionality  and  conformation which include the ionic conduction and thermal
              behavior  of  these  unique polymer-containing nanocomposites.    %%%    The 
              development of new synthetic methods to build the capability for designing 
              materials  with  specific properties is a high priority in materials  research.
               This  approach  is  aimed  at understanding processes  that  control 
              nanoscale  structures,  designing  and  synthesizing into materials  novel 
              properties  or  unusual  combinations  of  properties, and structural,  thermal
               chemical,  and  electrical characterization.
