Abstract    :
              This symposium will be modeled on the Frontiers of Science  symposium series
              organized by the National Academy of  Sciences.  The meeting will be designed
              to bring together a  select group of the nation's best young engineers from 
              industry, academia, and government to discuss pioneering  technical work and
              leading edge research in various  engineering fields and industry sectors.  The
              goal of the  symposium is to introduce the nation's outstanding young 
              engineers to each other, and through this interaction  facilitate collaboration
              in engineering and the transfer of  new techniques and approaches across
              fields.
