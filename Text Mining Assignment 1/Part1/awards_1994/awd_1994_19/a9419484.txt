Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  John S. Walker  Univ. of ILL. Urbana-Champaign  CTS-9419484     
              Computer circuits and optical devices are produced on wafers sliced from
              crystals of semiconductors such as silicon, gallium-arsenide and
              indium-phosphide.  Advances in computers and in optical devices have produced a
              demand for better crystals.  A crystal is grown from a volume of liquid, and
              its properties are determined by the motion of the liquid during crystal
              growth.  A magnetic field can be used to control the liquid motion and thus
              produce crystals with better properties.  Mathematical and numerical methods
              are used to predict how a specific magnetic field will affect the liquid motion
              and the properties of the crystal.  With the models begin developed, the
              magnetic field can be optimized in order to achieve the greatest possible
              improvement in the properties of the crystals.  Improved crystals will lead to
              faster and more reliable computer circuits and to superior optical devices,
              such as lasers and high-speed optical communication systems.
