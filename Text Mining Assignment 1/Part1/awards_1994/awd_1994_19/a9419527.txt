Abstract    :
              9419527  Wharton  This award supports a workshop entitled Antarctic Geographic 
              Information Systems.  The goal of the workshop is to bring together  experts in
              Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and active  Antarctic researchers with an
              interest in spatial analysis to  assess the need for a US Antarctic Program
              (USAP) GIS and to  discuss how such a system might be developed.  The impetus
              for  holding this workshop is two-fold: 1) the spatial analysis  requirements
              of Antarctic researchers are growing rapidly; and 2)  the USAP requires
              objective input in order to prioritize research  support decisions relating to
              the potential development of a USAP  GIS.  The three day workshop will be
              hosted by the US Geological  Survey in Reston, Virginia, and will be by
              invitation.  The  organizing committee represents a good cross-section of the 
              Antarctic research community and all members are familiar with,  though not
              experts on, GIS.  Invited participants will include GIS  experts from
              universities, government agencies, and the private  sector, as well as active
              USAP researchers.  A workshop report  summarizing results from the workshop
              will be produced.
