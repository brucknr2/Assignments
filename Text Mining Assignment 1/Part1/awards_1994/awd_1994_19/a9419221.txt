Abstract    :
              Henikoff  9419221  Abstract  The second international meeting on Drosophila
              Heterochromatin will  be held in Honolulu, Hawaii, January 3-7, 1995.   %%% 
              Chromatin, the DNA-protein complex which contains the genetic  information of
              eukaryotic cells, is divided into euchromatin and  heterochromatin. The
              euchromatin has been the focus of genetic  studies since those regions contain
              most of the active genes. Until  recently, heterochromatin was thought to be
              largely devoid of genes  and those that were contained within the
              heterochromatin were  thought to be silenced. The newer technology has made it
              possible  to demonstrate that much of what was thought to be true is not and 
              the study of heterochromatic structure and function is a rapidly  changing and
              expanding field. This meeting will provide an  opportunity for scientists at
              all levels and from all parts of the  world to communicate in both formal and
              informal ways.    ***
