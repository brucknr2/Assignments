                                                             PAUSTIAN    Knowledge of soil
              organic matter (SOM) dynamics is fundamental to understanding the functioning
              of agricultural ecosystems. The ability to predict nutrient dynamics (including
              plant growth and nutrient losses) and to assess the long-term sustainability of
              managed ecosystems rests largely on understanding organic matter turnover and
              storage in soils. Accumulated evidence from long-term field experiments, tracer
              studies, and soil process studies indicate that as much as half the SOM turns
              over on time scales of 10-50 years or less, is the primary determinant of
              native soil fertility, and is sensitive to management practices. SOM also is
              key to soil structure and linked to soil aggregates. This intermediate-aged
              organic matter is thought to be a critical component of fertility of
              agricultural soils and is the focus of this research project.    This research
              is important for the analysis of management effects on soil quality and the
              prediction of organic matter and nutrient dynamics in low-chemical input and
              conventional cropping systems. The research also assists in understanding land
              management effects on soil carbon where land-use changes are occurring.
