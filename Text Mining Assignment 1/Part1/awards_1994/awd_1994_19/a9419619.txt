              Tonks This is s request for support of a conference on Tyrosine Phosphorylation
              and cell Signalling.  The phosphorylation of proteins on tyrosyl residues is
              know to be essential in the control of fundamental cellular processes including
              growth and proliferation, differentiation, cytoskeletal function and the cell
              cycle.  There is currently activity in characterizing the structure, regulation
              and function of both protein tyrosine kinase and protein tyrosine phosphatases,
              which govern by their coordination the levels of cellular phosotyrosine.  The
              objective of this meeting is to provide a format to integrate the study of
              these tyrosine kinases and phosphatases to see how they contribute to the
              biological systems.  The sessions will be based on physiological processes and
              cellular functions rather than categories of enzymes, to provide a biological
              context.  With the exception of the keynote address, all speakers will be
              selected from submitted abstracts.  This will allow emphasis to be placed on
              encouraging graduate students,  postdocts and young independent investigators
              to present the talks .  This will also facilitate the presentation of the most
              recent results. %%%  Meetings like this are important for encouraging
              interaction among scientists working in similar or related fields.  A meeting
              like this also provides opportunity for young scientists to present their work
              and also to meet others in the field. ***                         ;
