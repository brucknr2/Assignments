Abstract    :
              9419393  Schmittmann  Though there has been significant recent progress in the 
              understanding of the co-operative behavior of driven diffusive  systems, a host
              of new questions and surprising discoveries have  also appeared.  These
              puzzling issues will be addressed, from  readily achievable goals to long-term
              projects.  The former include  (i) continued studies of uniformly and randomly
              driven systems,  focusing on global features of the phase diagram and detailed 
              properties like critical singularities, (ii) further exploration of 
              multi-species and multi-layer systems, and (iii) theoretical  understanding of
              interfacial instabilities and anomalous  correlations.  The latter is concerned
              with some fundamental  questions, e.g., methods for simulating quenched
              impurities in  finite systems with global currents, the existence of essential 
              singularities at first order transitions far from equilibrium, and  the role of
              detailed balance.  %%%  An exciting and rapidly expanding area in condensed
              matter physics  is the study of complex co-operative behavior in systems driven
              far  from equilibrium.  Prominent examples include self-organized  critically
              and driven diffusive systems.  Since non-equilibrium  phenomena are abundant in
              nature, it is clearly important that they  be well understood, both in terms of
              theoretical foundations and  practical applications.  A promising approach
              consists of  investigating simple models which retain the essential 
              characteristics of these systems.  Using an interplay of computer  simulations
              and analytic methods, specific studies on such models  is proposed, with a view
              to a wide range of potential applications,  e.g., gel electrophoresis,
              intercalation processes, flow patterns  of granular materials or traffic, flux
              creep in superconductors,  biased diffusion on surfaces, and the dynamics of
              fracture.
