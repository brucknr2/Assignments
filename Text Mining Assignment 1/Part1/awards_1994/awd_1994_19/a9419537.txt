Abstract    :
              9419537  Cheng    This Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC)
              is  being funded as a multi-site research Center.  Northwestern  University is
              adding the Georgia Institute of Technology as a  research site in the I/UCRC
              for  Engineering Tribology research.   Four companies are joining the Center
              with the Georgia Institute of  Technology becoming an additional research site
              in the Center.    The joint operation will add research activities on 
              modelling of  mechanical seals, investigation of hydrodynamic  film forming 
              capability of various liquids, and the optimization of the dicing  of silicon
              wafers to the existing research activities and attract  more companies to joint
              the Center.    The researchers involved with the Centers are well qualified to 
              perform the research projects.    The Program manager recommends the
              Northwestern University be  awarded $25,000 for the first year of a five year
              continuing award.    Near the end of each 12-month period, the Program Manager
              and/or  the Division Director of the Engineering Education and Center's 
              Division will review the progress of the Center on a number of  renewal
              criteria, including the following: 1) the extent to which  the
              industry/university interaction is developing; 2) the extent to  which the
              support base is developing; and 3) the extent to which a  robust research
              program is developing.  If the review is  satisfactory, the Program Manager
              will recommend support for the  next period of this continuing award.
