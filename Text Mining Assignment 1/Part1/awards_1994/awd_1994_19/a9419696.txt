Abstract    :
              9419696  Bielak  This action is to support a workshop to address the use of 
              advanced computer architectures for the solution of large-scale  problems in
              geotechnical earthquake engineering and strong ground  motion seismology,
              including the application of visualization and  animation techniques.  The
              workshop is to be held in the Fall of  1994.    The workshop will convene
              selected researchers and practitioners  from academia, industry and government
              to exchange information  and ideas,  and to provide broad guidelines for the
              use of this  technology.    With the advent of supercomputers, earthquake
              engineers and  seismologists have begun to address, mainly with the help of 
              vector multiprocessors, problems of great practical interest,  such as the
              three-dimensional analysis of the seismic response of  earthdams and alluvial
              basins.  Anticipated increases in raw  computing power over the next five years
              will not be sufficient  for the successful understanding and prediction of the
              earthquake  response of large systems, unless simultaneous advances are made 
              in physical modeling, numerical approximations, parallel  algorithms, and
              software tools for the new generation of high  performance parallel systems.   
              Another important aspect of the computational process, which is  shared by
              engineering activities such as field and laboratory  experiments, is the need
              to process and understand vast amounts  of numerical data.  In recent years
              advanced visualization and  animation techniques have been developed to assist
              in analyzing  and interpreting these large numerical data sets.  Thus this 
              workshop will discuss these evolving trends associated with the  use of
              advanced computer architectures and visualization  techniques as applied to
              earthquake hazard mitigation.  ***
