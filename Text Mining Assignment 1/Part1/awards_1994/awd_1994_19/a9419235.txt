Abstract    :
              9419235  Tape  This project is an experimental and theoretical study of ice 
              crystals in the antarctic atmosphere and the halos that they  produce.  For
              reasons that are not currently known, the antarctic  interior experiences more
              frequent and better developed halos than  any other location on Earth.  The
              objectives of the project are to  observe natural halos at South Pole Station
              and to sample ice  crystals in order to validate computer models of light
              refraction  and reflection in ice crystals.  Such models have the potential for
               the remote sensing of atmospheric conditions.  Controlled  experiments, such
              as seeding the atmosphere with dry ice, will  produce artificially generated,
              but simple and well-formed single-  species crystals.    The project provides a
              unique mechanism for examining the crystal  growth and evolution process in the
              natural atmosphere; the  observation of halos through polarizing filters will
              also allow an  examination of the atmospheric ice crystal orientation, shape,
              and  size.  It will advance our understanding of the reasons for the  growth of
              well-formed ice crystals, which is a characteristic of  the antarctic
              atmosphere, but is not generally observed elsewhere.  ***
