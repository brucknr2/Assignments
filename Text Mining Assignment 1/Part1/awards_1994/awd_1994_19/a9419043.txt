Abstract    :
              9419043  Rader    This project supported under the technology Development 
              activity area of the Technology Reinvestment Project (TRP),  is designed to
              develop processes for the manufacturing of  micro surgical knives.  Bulk wet
              etching of silicon has been  well developed, and recent research interest has
              focused on  fabricating structural components using semiconductor  processing
              technology.  In the intermediate size scale of  the proposed surgical scalpels
              (larger than integrated  circuit features, smaller than traditionally machined 
              components), silicon is not a structural material.  Previous  research has
              shown the potential for bulk forming structural  shapes from harder ceramic
              materials such as sapphire.  The  potential gains from the development of
              processing for both  commercial and defense related structures will be examined
               herein.  %%%  The objective of the TRP is to stimulate the transition to a 
              growing, integrated, national industrial capability which  provides the most
              advanced, affordable, military systems and  the most competitive commercial
              products.  TRP programs are  structured to expand high quality employment
              opportunities  in commercial and dual-use technologies, manufacturing and 
              technology assistance to small firms, and education and  training programs that
              enhance US manufacturing skills and  target displaced defense industry workers.
               This specific  project is a joint venture between the personnel at the  Storz
              Ophthalmic Instruments Company and the Microsurgery  Advanced Design
              Laboratory, Johns Hopkins Hospital.  ***
