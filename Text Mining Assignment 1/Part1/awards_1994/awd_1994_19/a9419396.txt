Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a three year program of  measurements of the rate
              of thickening or thinning of the  ice sheet at selected sites in Antarctica. 
              The work  involves measuring the vertical velocities of markers  anchored at
              several depths in the ice sheet and retrieving  shallow firn cores to determine
              density and long-term  average accumulation.  Precise, absolute marker
              positions  will be obtained using Global Positioning System (GPS)  Surveys. 
              The three existing sites will be revisited and  thirteen new sites in nine
              locations have been proposed for  establishment on the East and West Antarctic
              ice sheets.  Measured thickening or thinning rates will be used to test 
              various glacio-logical hypotheses.  The results of the work  will also be
              useful for calibrating data from satellite and  airborne altimetry of ice
              sheets.  ***
