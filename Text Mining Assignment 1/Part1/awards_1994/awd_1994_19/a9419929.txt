Abstract    :
              NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY    PI:  URCUIOLI    IBN-9419929    How Expectancies
              Influence  Behavior         The ability to anticipate forthcoming events which 
              occur with predictable regularity is very important to both  humans and
              animals.  The capacity to anticipate future  events has often been demonstrated
              to influence ongoing  behavior.   Yet there is much about this important
              cognitive  ability that is not well understood.  This research program  will
              examine the types of situations in which animals learn  to expect predictable
              future events, will assess the  cognitive processes by which these expectancies
              develop and  will investigate the mechanisms by which these expectancies 
              influence behavior.  These goals will be accomplished  through experimental
              comparisons of the predictions made by  two prominent learning theories
              regarding the nature of the  experiences thought important for expectancies to
              develop  control over behavior.  The resulting information will  provide a much
              clearer picture of which types of experience  are necessary, and will thus
              provide important insight into  the origins of the ability to anticipate
              events.
