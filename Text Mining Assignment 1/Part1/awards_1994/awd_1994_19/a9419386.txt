Abstract    :
              For many practical problems, the information concerning the system  under study
              is often represented in two forms: one is a set of  input-output data pairs,
              and, the other is a set of linguistic  descriptions about the system, often in
              the form of IF-THEN fuzzy  rules.  Traditional system identification methods
              and  classification methods, even including the (model-free) neural  network
              approaches, can only utilize the input-output data pairs.   This research will
              continue to develop general methods to combine  both input-output data pairs
              and linguistic IF-THEN rules into  signal - processing systems designs.    The
              new direction that this research is taking is the handling of  uncertainty by
              using fuzzification in a fuzzy logic signal  processor.  The nonsingleton FLSs
              will be applied to a variety of  important signal processing problems including
              fuzzy  classification.    The objectives are to: (1) establish a measure of
              uncertainty for  the output of a nonsingleton FLS, in accordance with
              estimation  theory practice; (2) develop a nonsingleton FLS state estimator for
               nonlinear dynamical systems; (3) extend fuzzy logic classifiers to  include
              imprecise training samples and noisy measurements, using  nonsingleton FLSs;
              (4) extend backpropagation and orthogonal least  squares parameter training
              procedures to nonsingleton FLSs and  classifiers; (5) apply nonsingleton FLSs
              to the forecasting of  multiple time series and to adaptive filtering problems
              of noise  cancellation and blind equalization; and, (6) apply nonsingleton 
              fuzzy logic classifiers to modulation classification.
