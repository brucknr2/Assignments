Abstract    :
              This is a renewal project for the continuation of research on the  terrestrial
              exosphere.  A new Monte Carlo exosphere simulator has  been developed, capable
              of converting the best available  thermosphere, ionosphere, and plasmasphere
              information into a  realistic, time dependent exosphere model.  The present
              version of  the UTD exosphere simulator (with slight refinements) will be used 
              in the continued study of specific exosphere problems.  ***
