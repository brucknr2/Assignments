Abstract    :
              9419675  Rieppel   The Sauropterygia is a major clade of fossil diapsid reptiles
              which successfully invaded the Mesozoic sea. The Triassic stem-group
              Sauropterygia provide a prime example for the study of the early evolutionary
              history of a major clade which involves the shift from one adaptive zone to
              another, i.e. the invasion of the marine habitat by reptiles. The study of the
              evolutionary history of this group, involving complex paleobiogeographical
              relations and fundamental changes of functional morphologic complexes, must be
              set against the background of a well corroborated pattern of phylogenetic
              interrelationships.   Complete knowledge of sauropterygians from the Germanic
              Muschelkalk provides the ideal background for a revision of Triassic
              sauropterygian faunas outside this region including  faunas from the Middle
              Triassic of Spain, Rumania, Israel, China, and the western United States. The
              phylogenetic interrelationships of stem-group Sauropterygia will be analyzed on
              a global scale. The resulting cladogram will be used as basis for an
              investigation of the palebiogeographical, paleoecological and functional
              morphological correlates of early sauropterygian evolution.
