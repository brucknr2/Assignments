Abstract    :
              9419197  Gaber    For a variety of historical and social reasons, African
              Americans are severely under represented at the PhD level in science and
              mathematics.  It is imperative that the scientific community take a leadership
              role in providing training opportunities and incentives for these young
              Americans to choose careers as active scientists.  Cooperatively with National
              Science Foundation, the Naval Research Laboratory has developed a summer
              research internship program for promising undergraduate students science,
              engineering, and mathematics.  The program specifically targets students who
              aspire to careers in scientific research.  This cooperative program provides an
              unique summer research internship experience for outstanding minority
              undergraduates.  During the first three years of the program twenty five
              outstanding undergraduates have been identified and recruited at three of the
              Nation's leading historically black colleges and universities:  Clark-Atlanta
              University, Spelman College, and Morehouse College.  These students have worked
              with distinction as summer research interns at NRL's Center for Bio/Molecular
              Science and Engineering.  Based upon the program's initial success, it is
              proposed to enlarge its scope to:        . Expand the number summer research
              internships by one third            . Extend the internship program to students
              from additional HBCUs            . Provide research opportunities at the
              Georgia Institute of Technology            . Establish research programs
              between NRL and participating HCBUs.  ***
