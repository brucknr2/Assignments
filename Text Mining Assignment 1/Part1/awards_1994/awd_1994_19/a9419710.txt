              Annual Symposium, entitled "Carbon Partitioning and Source-Sink Interactions in
              Plants," to be held January 19-21, 1995.  It is organized by Professor Monica
              A. Madore, Department of Botany and Plant Sciences, UCR, and Professor William
              J. Lucas, Section of Plant Biology, Divison of Biological Sciences, University
              of California, Davis.    The objective of the 1995 Symposium is to bring
              together scientists working in the area of carbon partitioning and plant
              source-sink interactions, with the intention that the presentations, and the
              discussions arising from them, will lead to a greater understanding of the
              cellular, physiological, and genetic aspects of plant carbon metabolism. 
              Speakers from abroad and from other insititutions, including many young
              investigators who have introduced innovative molecular approaches to the study
              of carbon partitioning, will be invited to participate.  Poster presentations
              will also be included in the program.  The presented papers, as well as poster
              abstracts, will be published rapidly.
