Abstract    :
                      9419349  Robert Sokal    There are currently two contending hypotheses
              for the origin  of the Indo-European speakers.  Sir Colin Renfrew has 
              challenged the established view, propounded by Marija  Cimbutas, that the
              Indo-Europeanization of Europe proceeded  in three waves between 4400 and 2800
              B.C. from the Pontic  Steppes, north of the Black Sea.  Renfrew has the Indo- 
              Europeans arising in Anatolia much earlier (ca. 7000 B.C.)  and entering Europe
              as early agriculturalists, distributing  themselves through Europe with the
              spread of the Neolithic.  Both of these hypotheses should have very different 
              consequences for the subsequent population relationships  among European
              groups.    Robert Sokal has constructed a unique database on European 
              ethnohistory, recording the location and movements of most  known ethnic units
              from 2200 B.C. to the present.  In an  earlier pilot project, his has
              established the utility of  the database in making further predictions of
              patterns of  genetic variation over the European continent.  He can now 
              proceed to testing the two overarching (and conflicting)  hypotheses of
              Indo-European origins and dispersal in Europe.  ***
