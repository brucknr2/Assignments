Abstract    :
              Funds are requested to acquire an automated DNA sequencer.  This instrument will
              be integrated, as a facility, into the  Institute for Biological Research and
              Technology at the  University of South Carolina.  This facility will eliminate 
              the necessity of research laboratories at the University  from either the
              lengthy process of establishing manual DNA  sequencing or the continued
              utilization of valuable  technical personnel for DNA sequencing projects.  Our 
              estimate is that the facility will generate at least 10,000  nucleotides of
              sequence per month.  the users of the  facility include faculty in both the
              Department of  Biological Sciences and the Department of Chemistry and 
              Biochemistry.  The scope of projects to be supported by  automated DNA
              sequencing include:  1.   Analysis of androgen mediated gene expression  2.  
              Mechanism of the enzyme thymidylate synthase  3.   Analysis of the genome of
              Caulobacter crescentus  4.   Analysis of fish stocks  5.   Analysis of species
              distribution and variation  6.   Role of histones in spermatogenesis  7.  
              Patterns in embryonic development       Progress on each of these projects will
              be greatly  facilitated by the acquisition of this instrument.
