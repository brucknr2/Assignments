Abstract    :
              9419472  Schouten       The principal investigators will evaluate the
              edge-driven  model for the kinematic evolution of the Gulf of Mexico.  Two- 
              dimensional and three-dimensional analysis of magnetic edge  anomalies around
              the Gulf rim will determine the nature and  distribution of magnetic boundaries
              that may represent  synchronous and diachronous parts of conjugate crustal
              boundaries  of North America and Yucatan.  The produce will be a  quantitative,
              continuous kinematic solution for the opening of  the Gulf of Mexico.    ***
