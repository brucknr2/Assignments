Abstract    :
              This group proposal requests funds to aid in purchasing a Nipkow disk  assembly
              and ancillary equipment that will establish a multiuser  confocal light
              microscope facility at the University of Memphis.  The ancillary equipment will
              aid in image acquisition and  analysis, and provide hard copies of images for
              publication. The  primary users of the equipment will be undergraduate,
              graduate and  postdoctoral students, and faculty in the Biology Department. The
               requested equipment will be an addition to a digital research  light
              microscope facility already established in the department  with funds from the
              University, a private foundation and industry.  Projects encompass a diverse
              group of subjects, using confocal  image analysis to investigate cell wall
              development in  actinomyetes, actin-mediated saliva secretion in tick salivary 
              glands, and cytoskeleton function in frog oocytes. Other projects  will use
              confocal microscopy to investigate symbioses between  dinoflagellates and sea
              anenomes, and between plants and nitrogen-  fixing bacteria. In all of these
              studies two major limitations are  loss of contrast by out of focus light
              (background haze) and lack  of the ability to assemble a three dimensional
              image of the object  of study. The requested instrumentation will virtually
              eliminate  these problems, and allow increased resolution that results from 
              confocal imaging, making it possible to progress rapidly in these  projects.
