Abstract    :
              9419900  Benson  As the nervous system develops, exuberant connections are made 
              between cells, many of which are later eliminated to arrive at the  final
              pattern of connections.  A question that has yet to be fully  answered is the
              role that neural activity plays in this process of  synapse formation,
              elimination, and consolidation.  This research  will investigate the formation
              of synapses between cultured  hippocampal neurons, which have been shown to
              closely resemble  their in vivo counterparts molecularly, structurally, and 
              functionally.  A number of experimental manipulations will be  performed to
              elucidate the role of neural activity in the formation  and stabilization of
              synapses and synaptic patterns.  This entire  process is integral to the
              development of the nervous system, and  is one that is modifiable by experience
              and learning.  The outcome  of these experiments may provide fundamental
              information about how  the electrical activity associated with neural
              activation refines  the connections between nerve cells.
