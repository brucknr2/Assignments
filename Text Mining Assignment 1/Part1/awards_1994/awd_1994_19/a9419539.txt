Abstract    :
              9419539  Hawkridge, Fred  With this award, the Chemistry Division and the the
              Bulgaria,  Poland and NIS Program of the the International Division are 
              co-supporting Dr. Fred M. Hawkridge of the Department of  Chemistry of Virginia
              Commonwealth University and Dr. Alexander  M. Pisarevsky of the Chemical
              Research Institute of St.  Petersburg University, Russia.  The two
              investigators will  collaborate to develop a new laboratory experiment
              appropriate  for a senior level Instrumental Analysis course in Chemistry.  The
              experiment, relevant to environmental concerns, will use a  novel glass
              electrode for measuring chemical oxygen demand in  water samples such as
              natural waters, sewage samples and  processing solutions.
