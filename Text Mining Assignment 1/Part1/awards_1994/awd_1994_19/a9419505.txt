Abstract    :
              9419505  Jaecks     Three projects are supported.  The first involves the
              transfer  of excitation form He+ to AR+.  The second is the study of the 
              photoionization of Ar+ using synchrotron radiation with emphasis  on the
              correlations of the product ion with the outgoing  electron.  The third
              experiment is a continuation of prior  research involving the breakup of H3+
              into three coulomb  interacting fragments.  All of the projects are designed to
              probe  the correlations involving particles of negative and positive  charge in
              collision environments.  ***
