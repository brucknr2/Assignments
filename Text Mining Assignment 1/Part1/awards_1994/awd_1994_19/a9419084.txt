Abstract    :
              9419084  Papanicolaou       Radiative transport theory is the principle tool for
               analyzing the incoherent transport of seismic energy in the  earth's crust,
              which is a very complex, inhomogeneous  elastic medium.  But its use at present
              is limited to  isotropic structures of infinite extend and does not account 
              for: (i) energy transfer among different elastic wave modes,  including surface
              waves, (ii) the anisotropic nature of the  inhomogeneities in the earth's
              crust, (iii) the large scale  structure and discontinuities in the mean
              propagation speeds  (the Moho discontinuity, for example), (iv) coherent
              effects  in the process of energy transfer.  Papanicolaou and Wu  propose to
              collaborate on developing the foundations of  radiative transport theory in
              seismic wave propagation in a  systematic and flexible way so that the above
              shortcomings  can be minimized, or eliminated if possible.  We will use  our
              extensive understanding of theoretical, computational  and empirical methods
              for the analysis of waves in random  media.
