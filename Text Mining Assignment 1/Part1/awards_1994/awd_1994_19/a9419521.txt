Abstract    :
              9419521  McCracken    This award provides funding for one year under the
              "Self-Sufficient  Partnership for Research" Program and a project entitled
              "Studying  Group Support Technology at I/UCRC Centers" to Georgia Institute of 
              Technology/University of Arizona's Industry/University Cooperative  Research
              Center for Information Management Research.  The Center  continues to meet the
              renewal criteria of the I/UCRC Program.    The Center project will study how a
              set of commercial software  tools (Group System V) could be used to support
              decision making in  an I/UCRC.  The study will determine the equipment
              availability at  all I/UCRC universities studying the economics viability of
              setting  up the system in I/UCRCs and run four implementation tasks at 
              I/UCRCs.    The researchers are eminently qualified to perform the Center's 
              research project.    The Program Manager recommends Georgia Institute of
              Technology  (including the University of Arizona subcontract) be awarded 
              $100,000 for one year.
