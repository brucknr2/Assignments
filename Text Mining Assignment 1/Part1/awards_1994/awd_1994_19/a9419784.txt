Abstract    :
              9419784  Reznikoff  This research uses Escherichia coli sigma 70 RNA polymerase
              and lactose (lac) operon promoter model system to study positive gene
              regulation by catabolite activator protein CAP.  CAP is thought to activate
              transcription by direct interaction with RNA polymerase.  One consequence of
              this interaction may be to stimulate an interaction between RNA polymerase and
              specific upstream DNA sequences.  The role of candidate (-40 region) DNA
              sequences in the CAP activation of the lac promoter will be investigated
              through chemical interference and site-specific mutation studies.  In addition,
              the possible limiting effect of these upstream sequences on lacP expression in
              the absence of CAP will be examined.  %%%  The first event in gene expression
              is the initiation of RNA synthesis or transcription.  This multistep process
              involves the interaction of the enzyme RNA polymerase with specific DNA
              sequences called promoters.  The promoter DNA sequence determines the start
              site and frequency of unregulated RNA synthesis.  This research will
              investigate in detail how the bacterial regulatory protein CAP facilitates the
              specific interaction of RNA polymerase with the bacterial promoter lac to
              activate transcription of the lac genes.  This CAP-lac system is a general
              model for understanding transcriptional activator proteins, which have been
              known to regulate gene expression for over 25 years.  ***
