Abstract    :
              9419753  Cadle   the Herpetology Collection of the Museum of Comparative Zoology
              is one of the largest and most comprehensive collections of its kind.  Well
              more than half of the world's named species of amphibians and reptiles is
              represented, including representatives of all families.  The collection is
              exceptionally rich in types and important historical collections.  The
              collection is heavily used by the international scientific community, as
              documented by citations approaching 50 papers per year in papers authored by
              scientists on all continents.  This project will accomplish the task of
              retrospective capture of the collection database using the software system
              MUSE.  Concomitantly, ongoing cataloguing using the system will be done by
              permanent curatorial staff.  At the end of the grant period, it is expected
              that the entire database of more than 300,000 records will be recaptured, and
              loan invoicing, labeling, and collection queries fully functional using the
              computerized system.
