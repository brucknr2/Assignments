Abstract    :
              9419314  Adair  The P.I. will make a theoretical study of possible interactions 
              between weak electromagnetic fields at various frequencies and  biological
              systems.  This will allow first-principle models to be  constructed that can
              guide and constrain studies of possible  deleterious effects on the human
              population.  ***
