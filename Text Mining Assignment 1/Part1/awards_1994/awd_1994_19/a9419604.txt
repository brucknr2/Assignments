Abstract    :
               9419604 Allen  Research will be carried out to explore and study a new approach
              to scanning calorimetry.  The proposed approach is potentially a very powerful
              method for directly obtaining quantitative values for small enthalpy of
              reactions at interfaces, surfaces and near surface regions.  We expect to
              achieve sensitivity equivalent to the enthalpy of submonolayer desorption, to
              demonstrate the utility of the method for the measurement of extremely small
              amounts of heat generated during solid/solid reactions and surface processes as
              well as low enthalpy of internal microcrystalline processes.  We will measure
              the kinetics of interface reactions such as the nucleation of silicides at
              buried interfaces, and begin a study of near surface processes, such as point
              defect annihilation and coalescence of vacancies in silicon following ion
              implantation. %%% The primary goal of this program is to develop a high
              sensitivity microcalorimeter based on modern thin film techniques, and to
              demonstrate its useful in gaining fundamental materials science information on
              surface science phenomena such as the enthalpy of surface reconstruction, phase
              transformations, and individual microscopic properties of surface chemistry
              processes such as the decomposition of adsorbed species during atomic layer
              epitaxy.   An important feature of the program is the training of graduate and
              undergraduate students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area
              of materials and processing research.  This research will contribute to
              improving the general perform ance of advanced devices and integrated circuits
              used in computing, information processing, and tele communica tions.  ***
