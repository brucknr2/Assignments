Abstract    :
                9419071  Klein  This award provides support for participation by graduate
              students and postdoctoral fellows in  the Hawaii International Conference on
              System Science (HICSS) that takes place January 3-6,  1995.  This conference
              has several themes, and the one of particular interest to this award is  the
              one on Biotechnology Computing.  This track brings together computer scientists
              and  biological scientist and provides an international forum to discuss
              current developments.   Finally, this conference does produce a referred
              proceeding, to allow other researchers to  gain from the topics that are
              discussed at the conference.
