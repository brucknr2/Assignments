Abstract    :
              9419216  Mesce    Many important behaviors are controlled by specific nervous 
              system circuits which use biogenic amines as transmitters.  In this proposal,
              Dr. Karen Mesce will extend preliminary  findings  in which the specific nerve
              cells of the leech that contain  the biogenic  amine octopamine were identified
              for the first time.  Octopamine is  known to have marked effects on this
              animal'snervous system,  but the   identity of the octopaminergic cells had
              never been  established.    Octopamine-containing cells show up in regions
              where they  may be related to reproductive behavior.  In addition,  octopamine
              is expressed in different cells within two  related leech species, so that
              comparisons between these two  species may help reveal some important functions
              for  octopamine-containing cells.  This project is likely to  produce a better
              understanding the roles of biogenic amines  in CNS function and behavior.  It
              is also possible that this  work will produce some practical insights into
              controlling  leech reproduction.***
