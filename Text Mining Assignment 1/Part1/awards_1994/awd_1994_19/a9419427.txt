Abstract    :
              9419427  Manson  The PI will develop and extend the theory of scattering of 
              small mass particles by surfaces, with emphasis on  interactions in which many
              quanta of energy are exchanged  during the collision.  The results of this work
              will provide  useful information on the dynamics of surface atom motions  and
              it will give information on the interaction potential  between the atomic
              projectile and the surface thorough  determination of the scattering form
              factors.  The theory  will be developed to handle the entire range of
              experimental  conditions from fully quantum mechanical conditions to  classical
              scattering.  The PI will carry out extensive  numerical calculations for helium
              atom scattering from clean  and ordered surfaces, from adsorbates, and from
              Langmuir-  Blodgett and self assembly films.  This program of work will 
              involve collaboration with some of the major experimental  groups in
              helium-surface scattering, including those at  Florida State, Gottingen, and
              Julich.  ***  This work involves developing the theory needed to interpret 
              experimental work on the scattering of small mass particles,  such as helium
              atoms, from surfaces.  Such experiments give  properties of the surface itself
              and also the interaction  between the projectile and the surface.  The computer
              will  be used to simulate scattering from clean surfaces, surfaces  with less
              than a layer of other types of atoms on it, and  films of large molecules which
              can be put on layer by layer.  These films are important in the production of
              computer  chips.  The PI plans to continue his long-term, close  collaboration
              with experimental groups at Florida State  University and at Gottinger and
              Julich in Germany.  He is  the principle theorist in the United States who
              helps  interpret these experiments.  ***
