Abstract    :
              The objective of this application is to replace inoperative equipment  and to
              upgrade obsolescent equipment of the shared instrumentation  facility of the
              department. Each of the investigators on this  application is involved in the
              preparation of pure proteins and nucleic  acids and the study of their
              properties, structure, and function. These  purifications require both low and
              high speed centrifugations. Most  also involve the separation of complex
              mixtures of biomolecules into  pure constituents. Recent technological
              innovations have made such  separations much faster and simpler. To this end,
              we are requesting a  perfusion chromatography apparatus with suitable
              detectors. Many of the  activity measurements and most of the sequencing
              reactions involve  radioactive assays. To this end, we are requesting a
              scintillation  counter.    All instruments will be used on a shared basis.
              Experience shows this  to be the most cost-effective way to use modern
              instrumentation.  Individual users will contribute to the maintenance contracts
              of these  instruments once the warranties expire. The sharing of maintenance 
              contracts is also the most cost-effective way of using the equipment.
