Abstract    :
              Abstract  A.Garcia  San Jose State University  CTS-9419121    This proposal
              involves the study of the flow between the read/write head and the disk in
              computer disk drives.  In a computer disk drive the read/write head does not
              touch the platter but rather aerodynamically flies a very small distance above
              it.  The head is very small (about 1/16th of an inch long) yet its distance
              from the platter is microscopic (about 1/10th the wavelength of light). 
              Because of these dimensions, this study will employ the direct simulation Monte
              Carlo method which permits computations at high Knudsen numbers.  The studies
              will include the effects of surface roughness and the dimensions of the actual
              read/write head.
