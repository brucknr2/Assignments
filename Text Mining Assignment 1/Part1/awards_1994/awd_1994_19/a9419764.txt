Abstract    :
              9419764  HUMPHREY  The Secretary of the Navy has been designated the Executive
              Agent  of the Department of Defense (DoD) for the logistic support  functions
              for the U.S. Antarctic Program (USAP).  The Commander,  Naval Air Systems
              Command (NAVAIR) is the designated coordinating  agency for all matters dealing
              with the procurement and maintenance  of the LC-130 aircraft owned by NSF and
              operated by VXE-6, the Navy  Squadron which provides Antarctic support.  Mr.
              John C. Papuchis is  the NAVAIR individual responsible for financial matters
              associated  with support for the NSF LC-130s under provisions of the Memorandum
               of Agreement (DPP-76-10886) between the DoD and the NSF.    The aircraft
              support provided by the DoD includes, but is not  limited to, contracting for
              the procurement of new aircraft,  overhaul and upgrades to existing aircraft,
              integrated logistic  aircraft parts support, aircraft configuration control,
              and  publication support.    Congress authorized the procurement of an LC-130
              for the USAP in  1993.  NAVAIR will coordinate the purchase of this aircraft
              with a  budget of $49,360,000, all of which was provided in an earlier 
              transfer.  This action calls for the transfer of $1,500,000 from  NAVAIR to the
              NSF to support the purchase of GFE by the Air Force  Systems Command (ASC) for
              that new aircraft.
