Abstract    :
                  9419247  Buzsaki    The behavior of organisms is controlled by electrical
              signaling in large populations of brain cells.  One of the great technical
              challenges for brain scientists is to describe the electrical activity of
              neuronal populations in a way that is related to behavior.  With this award, a
              team comprised of a neuroscientist, a mathematician and an engineer, and headed
              by Dr. Gyorgy Buzsaki, will construct a system for monitoring the signals
              produced by large numbers of brain cells recorded from animals while they are
              engaged in bouts of behavior.  The team will test their methods by recording,
              analyzing and displaying the signals of cells within the hippocampus, a
              structure believed to be essential for certain types of learning.  This work
              should have broad impact on the methods used in future research by both
              experimental and theoretical neuroscientists in the attempt to understand the
              neural control of behavior.
