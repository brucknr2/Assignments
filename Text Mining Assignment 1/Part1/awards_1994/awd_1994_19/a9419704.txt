Abstract    :
              This proposal requests funds for a replacement protein  sequencer for the UCSD
              Biology Department.  The existing  sequencer has operated for 10 years and has
              analyzed more  than 1650 samples for 130 laboratories.  However, existing 
              sequencer is obsolete and the day is rapidly approaching  when it will no
              longer be repairable.  In addition,  improvements in sequencer technology and
              chemistry have been  made since the purchase of the existing sequencer.  Cycle 
              times have been shortened by 50%, reagent consumption has  been reduced,
              sensitivity has been improved from 100 pmole  to less than 2 pmole of sample,
              and the introduction of  multiple cartridges offers significantly increased
              sample  throughput.  The use of the protein sequence information  includes the
              necessary first step in the construction of  oligonucleotide probes and
              eventual cloning of genes,  investigation of the posttranslational
              modifications in  proteins which are important for protein function, 
              identification of functionally important regions of proteins  after amino acid
              modifications and peptide isolation,  investigations of evolution in genes from
              various species,  and the identification of proteins as novel, new proteins by 
              comparing N-terminal sequence data with the available  protein sequence data
              bases.
