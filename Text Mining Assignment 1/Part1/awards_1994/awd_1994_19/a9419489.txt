Abstract    :
              9419489  Randall  A major point of interaction between photosynthesis, 
              photorespiration and mitochondrial respiration is at the  pyruvate
              dehydrogenase complex (PDC).  This multi-enzyme  complex is the primary entry
              point for carbon into the Krebs  cycle for energy production and the generation
              of  biosynthetic intermediates.  PDC also provides the precursor  for fatty
              acid biosynthesis, branch chain amino acids,  isoprenoid compounds and some
              growth regulators.  Objectives  of this research are: to characterize the
              expression of PDC  component enzymes, their mitochondrial import, processing 
              and assembly in the complex; to characterize events,  mechanisms and modulators
              of PDC activity during development  and photosynthesis in C3, C4, and CAM
              plants; to extend  biochemical characterization of PDC and establish in vitro 
              and in organello regulatory mechanisms; and, to examine the  long-term
              regulation/expression of PDC.  Pea and Arabidopsis  are the primary
              experimental systems used.  This project  will facilitate evaluation of the
              following concepts: that  import and assembly of the mitochondrial matrix
              multi-enzyme  cmplex, PDC, requires chaperones; that reversible 
              phosphorylation of PDC is a primary control mechanism for  carbon entry into
              the Krebs cycle; that PDC regulatory  mechanisms differ during development and
              between C3, C4 and  CAM plants.
