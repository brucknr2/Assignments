Abstract    :
              O'Neil  9419467   This research will determine how the genetic correlation among
              traits may constrain the ability of a species to become optimally adapted. 
              Specifically, working with the plant species, purple loosestrife, the
              researcher will manipulate the timing of flowering events to determine which
              characteristics, such as flowering duration, date of flowering initiation, and
              flowering synchrony, are genetically correlated.  Preliminary results suggest
              that selection favors individuals with certain combinations of traits that are
              negatively correlated with other traits also favored by selection. 
              Consequently, the optimal, or best, combination of traits for seed production
              may not be achievable by selection.   The results of this research will provide
              plant breeders with information on how genetic correlations among traits may
              constrain the improvement of domesticated plants.  For example, selecting for
              traits such as higher fruit yield, could lead to selecting for undesirable
              characters correlated with the traits of interest.  This research will also
              provide basic ecological information on purple loosestrife, a pest species
              taking over wetlands, and provide information useful in controlling the spread
              of this species.
