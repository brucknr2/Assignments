Abstract    :
              9419206  Rieseberg   Biological species are often defined as groups of
              interbreeding organisms in populations that do not exchange genes with other
              groups.  Any factor that impedes the exchange of genes between two species
              contributes to reproductive isolation and hence to the integrity and coherence
              of individual species.  However, many physiological or reproductive barriers
              between species do not prevent gene flow completely but allow some small amount
              of hybridization to occur; and some of these barriers may actually limit gene
              flow to certain regions of the genome only.   The purpose of research by Dr.
              Loren Rieseberg at Indiana University is to test empirically the effects of one
              of the most important reproductive barriers to gene flow in plants, chromosomal
              structural differences.  This will be accomplished by surveying several hundred
              individual plants taken from two hybridizing populations (in California and
              Oklahoma) of sunflower species, genus Helianthus (Asteraceae), and by making
              use of 139 particular genomic markers of sunflower chromosomes already
              developed as a result of prior research support.  Because the chromosome
              locations of these molecular markers are known in each of the parental
              sunflower species and differ in location in several instances, they can be used
              to trace the flow of particular genes or chromosomal segments across the
              species barrier in the two zones of hybridization.  The results will yield data
              about the effectiveness of chromosomal structural differences as reproductive
              barriers and they will indicate whether such barriers limit interspecific gene
              flow to structurally similar regions of the genome only.
