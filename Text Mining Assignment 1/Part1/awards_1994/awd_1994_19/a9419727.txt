                                                             PARMELEE, EDWARDS, STINNER, and
              GROFFMAN    Recent research indicates that earthworms are significant organisms
              in affecting key transformations of carbon and nitrogen in agroecosystems.
              Earthworms can increase the cycling of carbon and nitrogen by interacting with
              the microbial community and by altering soil structural properties. Deqpite
              increasing evidence that earthworms have a major role in nutrient cycling
              processes in agroecosystems, little research has addressed the role of
              earthworms on ecosystem-level flux of nutrients in the field. Established
              enclosures will be used where earthworm populations have been either reduced,
              left un-manipulated, or increased. The research will address the question of
              what are the ecosystem-level effects of earthworms on the conservation and loss
              of carbon and nitrogen in agroecosystems.    This research is important because
              it will, for the first time, examine how a specific group of soil invertebrates
              can control the balance between storage and loss of nutrients in ecosystems.
              The research will develop a model approach for investigating the effects of key
              organisms on ecosystem-level flux by combining studies of biological, chemical,
              and physical processes. The research also is relevant to basic ecosystem
              questions concerning nutrient cycling processes, and will provide essential
              data to evaluate sustainability in agroecosystems because of the focus on
              storage and loss of nutrients.
