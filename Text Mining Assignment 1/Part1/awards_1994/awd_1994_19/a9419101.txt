Abstract    :
                This  research  addresses the representation of point  patterns  using 
              nonmetric  information.   Point  patterns  are  especially  useful  as  feature
               point models of more complex  images.  Image  representation  is  essential to
              both human and  machine  vision.  Nonmetric information is of particular
              importance since there  is  considerable  evidence that human vision utilizes
              it extensively,  as  opposed  to  precise,  metric measurement.  For  many 
              visual  cognition tasks, it seems important for humans to be able to look  for
              visual patterns, which must be very general and flexible thus  not   metric.  
              This  research  will  contribute  to   both   the  understanding  of  human 
              visionand the  development  of  machine  vision based on relative imprecise,
              inexpensive sensors
