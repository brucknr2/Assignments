              94-19400  Turner, Edwin              Gravitational lensing is a tool for
              studying fundamental  problems in cosmology and astrophysics. Three aspects
              will be  studied:              First, a new 3.5 meter telescope with remote
              observing  capabilities will be used to monitor the brightness of images in 
              candidate and known lenses. The light curves will be used to  measure the value
              of the Hubble constant, test the lens  hypothesis for controversial systems,
              and detect microlensing  events, which have implications about the nature of
              dark matter  and the very small scale structure of quasars.             
              Second, observations of new candidate lenses to be  identified in the Sloan
              Digital Sky Survey data sets will enable  the assembly of a large (several
              hundred) well controlled  statistical sample, thus allowing measures of
              fundamental  cosmological parameters.              Third, advanced cosmic
              simulation and numerical lensing  codes will be employed to predict the lensing
              consequences of  various scenarios for the formation and evolution of galaxies
              and  large scale structure. These predictions will be compared to  observations
              to test the theories.
