Abstract    :
              This project, called VISIONLAB, will bring state-of-the-art  workstation
              technology to the University of Hawaii.  VISIONLAB will  take advantage of the
              UNIDATA program's data stream to bring real-  time weather data, and interact
              with UNIDATA's support environment  to develop new software capabilities
              directed at the tropical  Pacific region.  A primary research objective will be
              mitigating  the impact of hazardous storms on society and industry through 
              improvements in understanding and prediction of regional and local 
              characteristics of these events.  Results from VISIONLAB research  initiatives
              will train undergraduate meteorology majors in the use  of computer graphics
              workstations for rapid access and graphical  display of real-time weather data.
