Abstract    :
              9419508  Mandelkern  The main objective of this research program is to improve 
              our understanding of the thermodynamics, structure and  properties of
              nonoriented, bulk-crystallized flexible-chain  polymers.  The research will be
              concerned with the  interrelation between molecular,  phase, and
              superstructures  and crystallization kinetics and macroscopic properties. 
              Carefully characterized molecular-weight and composition  fractions of linear
              polyethylenes, as well as well-defined  blends of these components will be
              studied.  Small and wide-  angle x-ray scattering will be used to investigate
              the phase  structure.  These studies will be correlated with thermal 
              measurements and analysis of Raman spectra.  The influence  of the initial
              topology and melt structure on the resultant  crystalline state will be
              investigated.  Studies of tensile  properties will be emphasized.  Advantage
              will be taken of a  recently constructed apparatus that only requires very
              small  amounts of sample.  Emphasis will be given to the influence  of stain
              rate and temperature, as well as molecular and  structural factors, on key
              tensile properties and the  transition between ductile deformation and brittle
              failure.  %%%  These studies should give us a better understanding of the 
              molecular and structural factors that govern macroscopic  properties of
              crystalline polymers and improve the end-use  of this class of polymers.  ***
