Abstract    :
              9419748  KELLOGG  In a two-part project Dr. Elizabeth Kellogg of Harvard
              University is studying the phylogenetic relationships and aspects of
              developmental biology of grasses in the tribe Andropogoneae.  Both corn (maize)
              and sorghum are members of this tribe, a large group of warm-season grasses
              that also includes sugar cane and many of the world's forage grasses.  The
              nuclear and chloroplast genomes as sources of character data, to measure
              mutational differences among the many species.  The developmental study
              emphasizes aspects of growth and differentiation in floral and inflorescence
              structures among various species, studied within an explicit phylogenetic
              context.  One goal of the project is to determine the evolutionary sequence of
              modifications in size, shape, and position of floral parts that have ultimately
              led to the origin of the cob in maize and of the related inflorescences in its
              close tribal relatives.
