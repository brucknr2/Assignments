Abstract    :
              9550467  Zhang  We propose to further conduct our research in the area of high 
              performance parallel/distributed and computing.  We will  concentrate on three
              important problem areas:  1) investigating  performance and computation
              problems in parallel and distributed  architecture and system design; 2)
              developing parallel numerical  methods and software for solving large
              real-world problems; and 3)  building software tool and environment for
              parallel and distributed  computing and performance evaluation.  Our underlying
              goal of this  research is to understand the comparative advantages and 
              disadvantages of various types of multiprocessing hardware and  software
              environments, and to discover new methods that efficiently  solve different
              types of application problems on parallel and  attract more minority graduate
              students to participate in high-  performance computing research supported by
              our established and  growing expertise in the proposed research areas.  The
              proposed  projects are major research activities in the newly established 
              High-Performance Computing and Software Laboratory at the  University of Texas
              at San Antonio, which has been funded by NSF,  the U.S. Air Force and
              industries.  ***
