Abstract    :
              9419800  Stanton    Because  increasing demand leads to expansion of agriculture
               into  marginal lands, and because intensive farming  methods  often  decrease
              soil quality, understanding the consequences  of  environmental stress for
              plant populations  is  becoming  increasingly  important.  Environmental 
              stresses  may  both  affect  the  productivity of individual plants  and  act 
              as  selective   forces  favoring  the  evolution  of  particular  combinations
              of traits in plant populations.  This  research  will  investigate  the  costs
              and benefits  of  evolutionary  changes   in   plant  populations  cultured  
              in   stressful  environments.   It  will  determine  whether  selection  for 
              survival  under  one  sort of stress improves  tolerance  of  other  stresses, 
              and examine the trade-off  between  stress  tolerance  and  maximum yield.  
              Plants will  be  grown  for  several   generations   under  a  range   of  
              environmental  conditions (high salt, high boron, low light, low nutrients, 
              low  water, and optimal conditions) at crowded and uncrowded  densities.  
              Finally,  seeds from each  population  will  be  grown across the whole range
              of test conditions to determine  how  adaptation to individual stresses affects
              tolerance  to  other  stresses and growth and productivity under  favorable 
              conditions.     The   results   should   have    significant  implications  for
              sustainable agriculture and for  directing  development  of  stress-tolerant
              strains of commercial  crop  species.
