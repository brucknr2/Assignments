Abstract    :
              Spilhaus   9419090  The U.S. Report to the International Union of Geodesy and
              Geophysics (IUGG) has long been an important and critical review of geophysical
              sciences presented to IUGG at its quadrennial General Assemblies.  In deeping
              with scientific societies' emphasis on electronic communication, the 1991-1994
              report will be distributed in both electronic and printed format.  This report
              (equivalent of 1250 printed pages) will appear as special supplementary issues
              of the AGU journal Reviews of Geophysics and will be available to individuals
              and institutions worldwide in both printed and electronic form.  It will
              receive wide visibility and be properly archived for future use.  The 1991-194
              U.S. National Report will comprise 198 individual review articles, each with a
              critical bibliography.  Through careful selection of topics, the report will
              serve as a unifying document for those involved in all areas of geophysical
              research.  ****
