Abstract    :
              9419538  Shoemaker    The Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for
              Aseptic  Processing and Packaging Studies is becoming a multi-university 
              Center with the addition of a research site at the University of  California -
              Davis to the original North Carolina State University  research group.  A total
              of four companies are joining the Center  inconjunction with the University of
              California - Davis research  site.    The research projects to be funded at the
              Center's new research  site are "Flow visualization of fluid/particulate
              mixtures in  tubes" and "Optimization of particulate texture in aseptically 
              processed products through determination of pectic activity, pectic 
              composition and mechanical properties."    The research are eminently qualified
              for this research.    The Center has been coordinated with Dr. Fred Heineken,
              Program  Director in the Division of Bioengineering and Environmental  Systems.
                 The Department of Energy's Sandia National Laboratories has  provided
              funding to augment the Centers ongoing research program  and to obtain a
              membership in the Center.    The Program manager recommends the University of
              California - Davis  be awarded $50,000 for the first year of a five-year
              continuing  award.  An additional $34,272 is recommended for one year with 
              funds provided by the Department of Energy's Sandia National  Laboratories.   
              Near the end of each 12-month period the Program Manager and/or the  Division
              Director of the Engineering Education Center Division will  review the progress
              of the Center on a number of renewal criteria  requirements, including the
              following:  1) the extent to which the  industry/university interaction is
              developing; 2) the extent to  which the support base is developing; and 3) the
              extent to which a  robust research program is developing.  If the review is 
              satisfactory, the Program Manager will recommend support for the  next period
              of this continuing award.
