Abstract    :
              9419797  Renwick     This research will provide basic information on the
              evolution of plant-insect relationships, using a model system of cabbage
              butterflies and Brassica plants.  The different sensitivities of geographic
              subspecies of a butterfly to chemicals in potential hostplants will be examined
              to explain patterns of plant use.  Also, differences between and within
              populations of butterflies will be studied to document the genetic variability
              in a given insect species.  The chemical compounds responsible for acceptance
              or rejection of specific plants will be identified.  Bioassays for effects on
              egg-laying, larval feeding and growth of the insects will be used to isolate
              the active compounds, and the extent to which taste or toxicity are involved
              will be determined.  The results are expected to provide an integrated picture
              of the interactions between plant chemistry and insect responses at different
              insect and plant life stages and with changing resource availability.     This
              research is expected to result in the identification of natural chemical
              compounds that defend plants against insects.  Information on the most
              vulnerable stage of the insects will be obtained, so that an accurate picture
              of plant escape from herbivory may result.  Since the project involves both
              native and introduced insects and plants, predictions about the development of
              new plant-insect associations my be possible.  The research may also determine
              the likelihood that a native insect can adapt to the different chemistry of an
              aggressively spreading naturalized plant.
