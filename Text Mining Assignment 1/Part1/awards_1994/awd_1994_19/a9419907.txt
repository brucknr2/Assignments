Abstract    :
              9419907  Krajewski   Dasyurid marsupials are the dominant terrestrial carnivores
              of Australia and New Guinea. The proposed study will continue the rich
              tradition of investigation into dasyurid relationshisp, one that began nearly a
              century ago with basic anatomical descriptions and has lately incorporated
              direct comparisons of gene sequences. The project breaks new ground in
              combining information from three genes, one rapidly and one slowing evolving
              locus from the mitochondrial genome (cytochrome b and 12rDNA, respectively),
              and one from the nucleus (protamine P1). Protamines are short peptides that
              package chromosomal DNA molecules in sperm cells, and their gene sequences have
              proven valuable in elucidating the relationships of several mammalian groups.  
               Once assembled for all dasyurid  species, this genetic database will refine
              our estimate of phylogeny to the point where specific questions about dasyurid
              evolution can be addressed. Most importantly, the answers to such questions can
              be made precise. New analytical procedures for detecting the coevolutionary
              relationships (if any) of species and their areas, as well as methods for
              reconstructing ancestral adaptations, are powerful because they operate on a
              known phylogeny. In effect, phylogeny is the framework for integrating,
              proximate, ecological explanations of biological diversity with their ultimate,
              evolutionary counterparts.
