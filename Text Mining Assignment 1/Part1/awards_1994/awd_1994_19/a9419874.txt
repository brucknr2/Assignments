Abstract    :
                This project supports the dissertation research of a student of cultural  
              anthropology from the University of Chicago.  The research will take place in
              Sri Lanka   where the student will study two relatively new export-oriented
              garment factories which   hire a predominantly female labor force.  Using
              ethnographic techniques of in-depth   interviews and participant observation as
              well as studies of local and regional archives,   the student will examine how
              the experience of work in these factories changes the   women's notions of
              themselves as people and citizens of the nation.  Women are   traditionally the
              store-house of traditional cultural values, and the student hypothesizes   that
              work in the factories, which explicitly aim to change their worker's identities
              to   relate more to the national state and less to their local group, will
              produce conflict and   change in the women and their families.  This research
              is important because the process of global market change has   brought
              foreign-owned or dominated work-places to many traditional parts of the world. 
                Understanding how the experience of work in these trans-national sites
              affects the   women workers, and through them their households and families,
              will help us understand   and deal with the stresses and tensions that the
              expansion of the global market produces.
