Abstract    :
              9419418  Sievering     This project is part of the Southern Hemisphere Marine
              Aerosol Characterization Experiment (ACE-1), which will be conducted in the
              remote Southern Pacific in 1995 using aircraft, ship-board, and ground-based
              measurements of a wide variety of chemical species, physical  and
              meteorological parameters with the central goal of investigating the formation,
              evolution, and optical properties of atmospheric aerosol. In this component,
              the role of non-sea-salt sulfate production from the oxidation of sulfur
              dioxide by ozone in sea-salt aerosol water will be investigated.    Aerosol
              particle samples will be obtained with a high-volume cascade impactor at Cape
              Grim, Australia and aboard the research vessel Discoverer during the ACE-1
              intensives, as well as during ship transit from Seattle, WA, to Tasmania. Ion
              chromatography analysis for anions and cations from aerosols collected in the
              different stages of the impactor, along with complementary data on the water
              associated with size fractions of the sea-salt particle mode, sulfur dioxide,
              ozone, and other ambient air concentrations as well as meteorological
              parameters will provide the necessary data for a comparison of observed and
              model predicted non-sea-salt sulfate in several sea-salt mode size fractions.
              These data, along with their interpretation, will also provide an estimate of
              the contribution that this mechanism of sulfur dioxide oxidation makes to
              sulfur dioxide loss rates as well as the total sulfur budget in the marine
              boundary layer.
