Abstract    :
              9419382  Lesher  The program has as its goal to provide experimental constraints
              on the polybaric differentiation histories of North Atlantic magmas, and to
              evaluate geodynamic models of plume-initiated rifting of the Greenland-European
              continent.  Two experimental studies will be conducted.  First, the melting
              systematics of garnet lherzolite will be characterized at conditions inderred
              for the early Tertiary "Iceland" plume using the diamond aggregate technique to
              determine the compositions of low degree melt fractions for garnet lherzolite. 
              Second, the partitioning of high field strength, rare earth, and transition
              group elements between basaltic liquids, clinopyroxene, and garnet will be
              measured up to 4.5 Gpa.  The data obtained in this study are expected to have
              wider applications in the field of igneous petrology, geochemistry, and
              terrestrial and marine geology.
