Abstract    :
              9419617  Springer   Evolutionary relationships among orders and families of
              marsupials (eg. koalas, kangaroos, opossums) have been studied by
              paleontologists, anatomists, physiologists and biochemists. However, a number
              of questions remain answered including relationships between Australian and
              American taxa. Proposed for study are DNA sequences from two mitochondrial
              genes that code for ribosomal RNAs.    The study will evaluate the usefulness
              of molecular vs. anatomical data in deciphering evolutionary relationships.
              Molecular data will also be used to estimate divergence times among marsupial
              lineages. These divergence times will be evaluated in the context of what is
              known about sea level change and the movement of continental plates in the
              geologic past to develop a zoogeographic hypothesis for the early evolution of
              marsupials. The database of DNA sequences generated in this study, in
              conjunction with sequences that are already available for placental mammals
              (eg. rodents, primates, whales, seals) , will allow for detailed study of the
              evolution of ribosomal RNA genes in mammals.
