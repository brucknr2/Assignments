Abstract    :
              9419263  Hudson     This project is part of the Southern Hemisphere Marine
              Aerosol Characterization Experiment (ACE-1), which will be conducted in the
              remote Southern Pacific in 1995 using aircraft, ship-board, and ground-based
              measurements of a wide variety of chemical species, physical  and
              meteorological parameters with the central goal of investigating the formation,
              evolution, and optical properties of atmospheric aerosol. In this component,
              cloud condensation nuclei will be measured onboard the NCAR C-130 aircraft, as
              well as at the ground in Cape Grim, Tasmania. These CCN measurements constitute
              one of the central objectives of the ACE-1 project, and provide a link between
              atmospheric chemistry and cloud research.   The continuous airborne CCN
              measurements can be used to gauge the indirect aerosol effect, i.e. the
              suggested increase in cloud stability due to increased CCN concentrations. CCN
              spectra will be compared with physical and chemical aerosol characterizations
              to determine if CCN spectra can be predicted from chemical and physical
              properties of the aerosol. This is important for aerosol modeling, climate
              modeling, and determinations of the origin of atmospheric aerosol. Comparisons
              between CCN and cloud droplets provide the opportunity to separate
              macrophysical and microphysical cloud properties and to distinguish between the
              effects of cloud dynamics and the effects of the physics and chemistry of the
              aerosol. The ACE-1 data will constitute an extension of other CCN and cloud
              droplet data bases with the ultimate goal of understanding the role of aerosols
              in the global cloud systems.
