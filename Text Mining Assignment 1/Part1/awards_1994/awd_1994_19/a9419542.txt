Abstract    :
                A workshop focused on identifying key contributions of research in  artificial
              intelligence (AI) to the National Information  Infrastructure (NII), in
              particular to the Information  Infrastructure Technology and Applications
              (IITA) program is  proposed.  The workshop will bring together AI scientists
              from a  broad spectrum of research areas and institutions with Program 
              Directors from NSF.  It will be held in conjunction with annual  scientific
              meeting of the American Association for Artificial  Intelligence (AAAI), and
              will both draw on expertise of attendees  at the conferences and report to
              them.  A report summarizing the  findings of the meeting will be prepared and
              disseminated with the  assistance of AAAI.
