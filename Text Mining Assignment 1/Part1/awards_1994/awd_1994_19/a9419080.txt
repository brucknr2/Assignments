Abstract    :
              9419080  The American Chemical Society (ACS) Division of Polymeric  Materials: 
              Science and Engineering is sponsoring a symposium at  the Washington, D.C.
              Meeting, August 21-26, 1994, entitled  "Opportunities for Women in Polymer
              Science:  Theory, Experiment  and Technology".  The Women Chemists Commitee of
              the ACS is a  cosponser.  This Symposium will be pedagogical, and is intended
              to  highlight the contributions of women in materials science, with  special
              emphasis on polymer science and engineering so as to  present positive
              reinforcement to women who are interested in, or  just starting careers in
              polymers.  %%%  ***
