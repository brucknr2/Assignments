Abstract    :
              9419192  McWilliams       This proposal is for the study of, "Turbulence Driven
              Ion  Transport".  It concerns the study of the transport of ions in  plasmas
              using laser induced fluorescence.  It will involve the  study of ion diffusion
              and convection in real space and velocity  space.  Ion transport will be
              studied in unmagnetized and  magnetized plasmas.  It is expected that
              underlying dependencies  of ion convection and diffusion on various scattering
              mechanisms  (both Coulomb and wave) will be determined.  Laser induced 
              fluorescence and optical tomography will be the central  diagnostic tools for
              study of plasmas with both argon and barium  ions.  ***
