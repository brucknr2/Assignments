Abstract    :
              9419765  Losos   In recent years , our ability to discover the phylogenetic
              relationships among species (i.e., how species are related to one another) has
              increased substantially, thanks to advances both in our ability to collect
              relevant data, such as DNA sequences, and in analytical advances in the ability
              to utiliza this information to deduce phylogenies. Although the relationships
              among species are interesting and scientifically important in their own right,
              phylogenies can be useful for other purposes as well.   %%%   This symposium
              will demonstrate the utility of phylogenies for framing hypothese that can be
              tested. In the past, phylogenies have been used to examine previously-derived
              hypotheses; i.e. hypotheses were framed based on other data and then examined
              in the context of the phylogeny to determine whether species had changed as
              predicted. However, this sympoqium will illustrate how phylogenies can be used
              to actually derive hypotheses that can then be tested by gathering data on
              extant taxa. For example, based on a phylogeny, one might deduce that a given
              feature had evolved earlier than the occupation of the new habitat. Thus, one
              might propose that the feature was required for use of that habitat, which one
              could then test experimentally using extant organisms. This symposium will
              include workers in fields as disparate as developemntal biology, behavior,
              ecology and conservation to illustrate the powerful uses to which phylogenies
              can be put to generate testable hypotheses.   ***
