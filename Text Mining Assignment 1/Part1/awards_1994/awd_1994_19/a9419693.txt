Abstract    :
              Archivists, librarians, and historians of science and technology in the Science
              and Technology Studies field are currently engaged in a number of new projects
              to preserve in digital format large bodies of material (text, sound recordings,
              images, video)  and to render them accessible, indexible, and searchable
              through a variety of different interfaces.  Other groups of  researchers in the
              STS field are engaged in designing software to be incorporated into the
              construction of multimedia databases and electronic digital libraries.   An
              urgent task for STS is to set priorities for tools and corpora that may join in
              the development of these digital libraries and to identify directions for
              future work most beneficial to the STS research community.    With support from
              this grant, a two day conference on the needs of the STS community is being
              held in New Orleans.  The aim is to bring together archivists and librarians
              engaged in digitization and preservation projects; researchers and scholars
              constructing multimedia databases in the STS field; computer scientists who
              have provided technical support and designed software for these projects; and
              representatives of funding agencies interested in digital libraries.  The
              meeting is being held prior to the national meetings of the History of Science
              Society, the 4S Society, and the Philosophy of Science Association, October
              12-15, 1994.  A report of the conclusions of the conference will be made at the
              national meetings.
