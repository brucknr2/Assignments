Abstract    :
              9419722  Stephenson    Recent  studies  indicate  that  phosphorus  fertility  
              can  control    plant    reproduction    by    controlling    the 
              characteristics  of  the  pollen.  Symbiotic  fungi,  called  mycorrhizal 
              fungi,  can increase the uptake  of  phosphorus  into  plants.   This  research
              will  determine  whether  the  symbiotic  fungi influence plant reproduction
              via an  effect  on  pollen  quality.  The project will greatly  advance  our 
              understanding  of  the response of plants  to  environmental  stress 
              (phosphorus infertility) and the role of mycorrhizal  fungi in that response. 
              The study will provide insight into  the  evolution  of natural plant
              populations, especially  in  regards to local adaptation and the genetic
              substructure  of  populations.     The   research   should   have    important 
              ramifications for the understanding of pollination of crops,  the  flow of
              genes among crops and their wild relatives, and  the  development  of 
              techniques for  pollen  selection  for  agriculturally desirable traits.
