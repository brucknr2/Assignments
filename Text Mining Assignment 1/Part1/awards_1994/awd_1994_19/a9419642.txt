Abstract    :
              Major instruments required to equip a facility for the study  of macromolecular
              interaction are requested.  These center  around a Beckman OPTIMA -XL - a
              analytical centrifuge.  To  complement this equipment, a dynamic light
              scattering  instrument and upgrades to existing fluorescence  instrumentation
              are requested. This equipment will be used  to determine protein equilibria
              distances within  macromolecular complexes, molecular weights and particle 
              shapes for DNA protein complexes, viral subassemblies and  nucleic acids.  Such
              a facility does not exist within the  University of Colorado system and is
              severely needed by a  group of investigator for their structural and
              mechanistic  studies.
