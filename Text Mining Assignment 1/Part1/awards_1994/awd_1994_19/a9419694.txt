Abstract    :
              This grant provides funds to the History of Science Society (HSS), the
              Philosophy of Science Association (PSA), the Social Studies of Science Society
              (4S), and the Society for History of Technology (SHOT) to provide travel awards
              to graduate students independent scholars to attend the annual meetings of the
              societies in 1994.  Three of these societies (HSS, PSA, and 4S) will meet
              together in New Orleans October 13-16.  SHOT meets in Lowell Massachusetts
              October 6-9, 1994.      These travel grants are essential for the future of
              these new scholars in the STS disciplines.  They will be able to present their
              research findings to their colleagues within the disciplines, receive
              constructive criticism and learn of new approaches and new areas of interest. 
              These meetings begin the process of introduction of these scholars to their
              peers.  The criteria for selection include active participation in the
              organized sessions of the meetings.  Decisions are made by a committee within
              each society.   This award will provide support for at least 80 graduate
              students and unaffiliated scholars to participate in these professional
              meetings.
