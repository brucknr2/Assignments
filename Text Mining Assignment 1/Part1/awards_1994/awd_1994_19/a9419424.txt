Abstract    :
              9419424  Babu    Description:  This project is to provide  support for a
              planning visit by Dr. Gutti Babu,  Department of Statistics at Pennsylvania
              State  University.  He is to interact with Professor  Arup Bose at the Indian
              Statistical Institute  in Calcutta.  Dr. Babu's experience on  bootstrap
              methods and Bose's expertise on auto-  regressive processes complement each
              other.   Another area of collaboration will be in  classification of stellar
              populations, where  the development of multivariate classification  schemes is
              required to handle the effects of  selection biases and possible censoring.
