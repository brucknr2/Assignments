Abstract    :
              In order for ionospheric tomography to reach its potential as a 
              three-dimensional global imaging system, its resolving capability  must be
              increased so that small scale effects and temporal effects  can be measured
              accurately.  This proposal is for the development  of two key components
              necessary for achieving such high resolution  imaging.  This research will
              develop (1) a thorough resolution  analysis system and (2) compensation
              techniques for unavoidable  physical constraints.  This project will provide a
              better  understanding of both the ionospheric imaging system and the field  of
              ionospheric tomography.
