Abstract    :
              9419603  zurLoye  This research will explore new low temperature synthetic
              routes  for the preparation of novel nitride materials, particularly  ternary
              nitrides.  Showing the plausibility of using microwave  synthesis for the
              preparation of additional solid-state nitrides  is the goal of this research. 
              Reactions to be studied include  the direct combination of a binary metal
              nitride, such as those  of gallium, aluminum, or silicon, with a transition
              metal to  produce a binary or ternary transition metal nitride at milder 
              synthetic conditions.  Two types of reactions will be studied:  reactions
              carried out in closed systems; and reactions carried  out in flowing systems. 
              %%%  Even though nitrides are an important class of industrial  materials, only
              a few hundred are known to exist.  The focus of  this research will be on a
              class of transition metal nitrides  that are increasingly recognized as
              important industrial  materials because they are hard and strong, and are good 
              conductors of heat and electricity.  In addition, some exhibit 
              superconductivity, and others have catalytic properties.  Transition metal
              nitrides are finding utility in diverse areas  such as structural materials,
              corrosion and scratch resistant  coatings, and as packaging materials in the
              semiconductor  industry.  ***
