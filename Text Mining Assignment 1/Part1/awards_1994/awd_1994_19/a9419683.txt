Abstract    :
              Abstract  ATM-9419683  Zhu           A new approach on the formation of gravity
              wave spectrum in  the middle atmosphere is proposed to investigate the
              statistical  properties of the observed mesoscale fluctuations in the middle 
              atmosphere.  A preliminary study has shown that scale-dependent  radiative
              damping of the temperature perturbations in the middle  atmosphere is an
              important process in the understanding of the  gravity wave spectrum.  Further
              research on this subject will fully  explore the basic idea of a balance among
              various spectral sources  and sinks by including other possibly important
              physical processes,  such as photochemical-radiative coupling, resonant
              wave-wave  interactions, and molecular diffusion, in the model.  Our 
              theoretical studies will be implemented in a two-dimensional  (latitude and
              altitude) numerical model.  Our model results will be  compared to the
              available observations from the Flatland radar for  the nonlinear wave-wave
              interactions and measurements from aircraft  on polar ozone for the vertical
              mixing.  The ultimate objectives  are to provide a more realistic
              parameterization for the gravity  wave saturatimn induced eddy diffusion and
              momentum deposition in  the large scale background flow.
