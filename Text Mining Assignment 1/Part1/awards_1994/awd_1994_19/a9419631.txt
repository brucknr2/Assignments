Abstract    :
              9419631  CLARK  This is an experimental and theoretical study of variation in
              biochemical traits that are related through metabolic pathways.  The
              experimental system focuses on the maintenance of lipid and glycogen stores in
              Drosophila melanogaster.  The investigator, Dr. Andrew Clark will quantify
              lipid and glycogen storage, along with the activities of 12 enzymes in
              associated biosynthetic and degradative pathways, to perform large-scale
              quantitative genetic studies of these traits.  There is much theory dealing
              with enzymes in biochemical pathways.  An objective is to develop the
              evolutionary genetic aspects of this theory and to test the fit of the theory
              to the model system of energy storage in Drosophila.  The idea that observed
              levels of phenotypic variation in populations arise from a balance between
              mutation inflating the variance and stabilizing selection restricting it has
              considerable appeal.  But attempts to estimate the necessary parameters have
              revealed discrepancies.  Theoreticians have shifted their focus toward
              pleiotropic effects of mutations as a possible explanation for heritable
              variation, and this experimental system is well-suited to test these ideas.
