Abstract    :
              9419115  Day       In well-known metamorphic belts associated with continental 
              collisions, peak metamorphism commonly was reached during or after  major
              crustal thickening.  In contrast, metamorphic belts formed at  the boundary of
              ocean/continent collisions commonly preserve low  grade metamorphism acquired
              prior to the final amalgamation of the  orogen.  This project will focus on the
              metamorphism preserved in  the western metamorphic belt of the Sierra Nevada
              where ophiolite  preserves metamorphism that pre-dates the Cretaceous Sierra
              Nevada  batholith and may be as old as early Jurassic.  Results will help 
              evaluate the thermal effects of the late Jurassic, Nevadan  deformation in the
              Sierra Nevada.  The outcome may also provide  guidance in interpreting
              metamorphism in other ocean/continent  collision settings.
