Abstract    :
              9419373  Schiffman   This award provides one-half the funding for the upgrade of
              an electron microprobe system housed and operated in the Department of Geology
              at the University of California at Davis. The institution is committed to
              providing the remaining funds necessary to carry out the project. The upgrade
              will consist of replacing the operating system computer and making improvements
              to the machine's imaging system. The upgrade is necessary to carry out a number
              of research and teaching projects requiring the analytical capabilities of a
              modern electron microprobe. Research topics include hydrothermal metamorphism
              of clay minerals in the oceanic crust and terrestrial geothermal systems, the
              metamorphic geology of accretionary prisms and forearc regions in Alaska and
              South America, low-grade metamorphism in the Sierra Nevada and Franciscan
              complexes, phase equilibria and kinetics of silicate systems at elevated
              temperatures and pressures, properties of silicate melts. In addition, the
              electron microprobe at UC-Davis is used by students and staff from the
              departments of chemistry, material sciences, soils, and the School of
              Veterinary Medicine.  ***
