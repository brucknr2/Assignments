Abstract    :
              9456125  Lewis                                    The project is conducting
              planning to undertake a strategy to  improve the integration of mathematics in
              science courses and of  scientific material in mathematics courses.  The second
              year  mathematics curriculum would be modularized to enable students to 
              acquire mathematical skills at different times as needed and  mathematics
              courses will incorporate student projects designed and  evaluated
              collaboratively with other disciplines.  The goal is to  incorporate new
              pedagogical strategies, including an emphasis on  interactive instruction,
              cooperative and group leaning, proficiency  in communication of technical
              material, and use of technology in  all departments.  To assure wide
              applicability of methods,  collaborations with other schools are being
              developed and serious  attention is being paid to dissemination of project
              results through  many channels.
