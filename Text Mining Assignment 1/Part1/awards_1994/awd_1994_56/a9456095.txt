Abstract    :
              9566095  Keynes  The University of Minnesota proposes to develop a new model for
              planning curriculum and  instructing its science and engineering calculus
              students which will fundamentally change  calculus instruction and subsequent
              course work at the University. This model will allow  incorporation of nearly
              all of the key aspects of a successful calculus reform effort, as well as 
              enabling significant opportunities for inclusion of interdisciplinary
              materials. The new structure  will attempt to reconfigure the large
              lecture/recitation format in many public research  universities in a
              cost-effective way to allow increased personal interaction between faculty and 
              students and encourage more student centered pedagogy and the use of varying
              technology as  the curriculum progresses. This curriculum will become the
              standard format for engineering and  science calculus instruction at Minnesota,
              and will be developed as a model program for other  public research
              institutions.
