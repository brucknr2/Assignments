Abstract    :
              9456023  Berger                                   The University of Illinois at
              Chicago, Chicago State University,  William Rainey Harper College, and Saint
              Xavier University propose  the formation of The Chicago Consortium for
              Applications of  Mathematics Across the Curriculum. This initiative will
              create,  share and evaluate curriculum changes and enhancement materials 
              associated with the applications of mathematics in the physical and  biological
              sciences. This new consortium will develop concurrent  syllabi, create modules
              and software, and design linked courses  which will be tested first at the
              consortium schools, and later at  peer institutions which share the largely
              urban and commuter  student body demographics. Input from Argonne National
              Laboratory  will be an added enrichment source and provide insight into 
              math/science applications of current national importance.
