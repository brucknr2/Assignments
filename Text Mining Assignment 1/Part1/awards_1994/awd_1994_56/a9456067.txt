Abstract    :
              9456067  Millett                                    A partnership of
              engineering, mathematics, and science faculty from  the eight general campuses
              of the University of California are  planning the development of an alliance to
              create, implement,  evaluate, refine, and disseminate a series of variable
              length  investigations. Each investigation involves students in  mathematical
              work in the context of a concrete engineering or  scientific investigation.
              Students will work in teams facilitated  by specially prepared assistants and
              scientific experts and will  have access to data, information, and experts
              through internet.    The student experience with exciting problems in science
              and  engineering using mathematics is intended to promote changes within  all
              the affiliated scientific and engineering disciplines as well  as mathematics. 
              Teams of affiliated faculty on each campus are  assisting in the planning of a
              full project proposal.
