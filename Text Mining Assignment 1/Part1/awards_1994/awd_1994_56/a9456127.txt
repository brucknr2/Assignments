Abstract    :
              9456127  Carothers  A coalition of five liberal arts colleges, a community
              college, a comprehensive state university,  and a research university will plan
              an interdisciplinary program on mathematics and  environmental problems.
              Mathematicians and scientists from a variety of disciplines will develop  an
              interdisciplinary entry-level mathematics and science course; will produce
              modules, labs, and  projects for several existing mathematics, biology,
              geology, engineering, and chemistry courses;  and will develop an
              interdisciplinary upper-division project-based course for mathematics and 
              science majors. These institutions have experience with mathematics curriculum
              reform, and  have worked well together previously under NSF curriculum and
              undergraduate research grants  and through the Michigan Calculus Network and
              the Pew Midstates Science and Mathematics  Consortium. The participating
              institutions also have a strong record of scientific research and  expertise in
              environmental issues. The coalition will provide a diverse range of
              institutional  perspectives and a variety of situations in which to test
              materials.
