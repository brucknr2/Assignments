Abstract    :
              9456000  Child                                    A Quantitative Learning and
              Teaching Program has been established  at Rollins College.  Faculty from nine
              different departments in  Mathematics, the Sciences, Economics, Politics, and
              Business have  been working together to establish interdisciplinary initiatives
               involving teaching and learning of quantitative skills.  In the  last two
              years, with support from the Bell South Foundation,  participating faculty have
              gathered and studied materials on  quantitative problem solving, have created
              instructional  guidelines, established a resource center, brought in experts as
               consultants to address the faculty, established two computer based 
              classrooms, hired an instructional specialist to work with faculty,  and
              recruited the first group of students to work with faculty on  the project.  An
              important component of this project is a summer  seminar for faculty.  This
              seminar series is being extended  throughout the academic year.  This enables a
              larger number of  faculty to participate.  The goal is to extend participation
              to  faculty in all departments.
