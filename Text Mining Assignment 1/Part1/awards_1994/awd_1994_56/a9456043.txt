Abstract    :
              The ultimate goals of the project are:      cooperative course development
              activities by at least 144 faculty  in mathematics and non-mathematics
              departments in at least eight  colleges and universities in Nebraska and
              Oklahoma.      these activities will bring together the best features of the 
              mathematics reform and the multimedia activities in all of the  consortium
              colleges.        these activities will provide both mathematics and 
              non-mathematics faculty with|  new math reform/multimedia lessons, curricula
              and courses that can  be offered        across the curriculum and across the
              nation.
