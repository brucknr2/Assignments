Abstract    :
              9416424  Darragh  The aim of this project is to increase the understanding of
              site  effects that may have caused the large shaking at Tarzana and the  Santa
              Monica Freeway collapse near La Cienega during the 1994  Northridge, CA
              earthquake.  The anticipated results at Tarzana  will be useful for site
              characterization, topographic  amplification and microzonation at similar
              sites. The anticipated  results at I-10 will be useful for site
              characterization as well  as design and construction practices of freeway
              structures at  similar sites.  The results will be shred with bridge designers.
                 The study focuses on the site response at two California Strong  Motion
              Instrumentation Program (CSMIP) stations:  Tarzana and  Baldwin Hills (located
              near the Santa Monica (I-10)freeway  collapse at La Cienega).  The objectives
              at both sites are to  clarify:  (1) the effects of different geology on site
              response  by the acquisition and compilation of seismic, geologic and 
              geotechnical data at the surface and from drill holes; and (2)  the
              contribution of the site in strong motion records of the  mainshock by using
              aftershock recordings of particular interest  are the causes of the sustained
              and high amplitude shaking of  over 1 g that was recorded at Tarzana, and the
              local site  response effects that may have amplified seismic waves and caused 
              damage at the collapsed I-10 freeway at La Cienega.    The following methods
              are employed:    1.Site characterization through standard shear-wave and   
              compressional-wave velocity measurements (surface and    downhole) and
              geotechnical testing of drillhole samples    damping, density and modulus
              reduction) from surface to    bedrock (or to very stiff material).    2.Site
              response is estimated by calculating the ratio of the    smoothed
              geometric-mean Fourier amplitude spectra from    aftershocks recorded at both
              the strong motion station and    nearby sites  For stations located at similar
              distances and    azimuths from the earthquake, the spectral-ratio method    is
              olates the site response from source and path effects.    3.Site response
              predictions from one-dimensional linear and    equivalent-linear models and a
              two-dimensional nonlinear model    are compared to actual response from strong
              motion recordings    to identify site effects and separate them from possible  
               source and path effects.  ***
