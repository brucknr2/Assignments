Abstract    :
              9416232  Hamburger  Light industrial buildings of tiltup and reinforced masonry 
              construction with panelized plywood roofs house thousands of  workers in the
              Western U.S.  In addition, strategic sectors  of the Western U.S. economy
              including the aerospace,  defense, electronics, banking, retailing and
              semiconductor  industries are located within buildings of this  construction. 
              The performance of these buildings in a major  regional earthquake clearly has
              major potential impact on  the safety and welfare of broad segments of the
              society.    This construction was shown to be vulnerable to earthquake  induced
              collapses in the 1971 San Fernando earthquake.  Building code changes were
              enacted in the mid-1970s were  effective in mitigating this vulnerability. 
              However, more  than 400 such structures in the epicentral region of the 
              Northridge earthquake, many conforming to these updated code  requirements,
              experienced partial collapse, graphically  demonstrating the inadequacy of
              current design approaches.    This project examines the response of these
              commercial and  light industrial buildings with wood framed roofs to near 
              source ground motions, to determine the causative failure  modes for these
              structures in the Northridge Earthquake, and  to develop and assist in
              implementing effective design  procedure changes to minimize the potential for
              catastrophic  failures in future events capable of affecting the Los  Angeles
              region, San Francisco Bay Area, Puget Sound region  and other areas of intense
              development within seismically  active zones.  The findings of this research
              will be  directly presented to code and standards development bodies,  in forms
              which can readily be implemented. Recommendations  will be developed to modify
              the design codes to provide  adequate margin in the near source zones of
              earthquakes. ***
