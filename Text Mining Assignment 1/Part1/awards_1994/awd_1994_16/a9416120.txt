Abstract    :
              9416120  Kanamori    This research is to investigate the relationship between
              the 3-D  crustal structure, the fault geometry and the dynamic  characteristics
              of the Northridge earthquake sequence.  The 1994  Northridge earthquake
              occurred on a south-dipping fault beneath the  Transverse Ranges, in striking
              contrast to the 1971 San Fernando  earthquake which occurred on a north-dipping
              fault.  This will  investigate why the two faults are segmented like this
              (north vs.  south), and what prevented the rupture of the Northridge earthquake
               from extending further to the west.  Since the Transverse Ranges  involve many
              active structures formed under a regional north-south  compressional stress
              system, a much larger earthquake than the  Northridge earthquake could occur if
              the system, a much larger  earthquake than the Northridge earthquake could
              occur if the  rupture extended over many segments of faults.  The work will
              also  involve investigation of the variation of dynamic characteristics 
              (waveform, stress drop, energy-moment ratio) of the major  aftershocks in
              relation to the 3-D structure.  This project is a  contribution to the National
              Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program  and is supported by the Northridge
              Earthquake Emergency  Appropriation.  ***
