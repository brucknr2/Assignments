Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    J. N. Newman  MIT  CTS-9416096    This project will develop new
              theoretical and computational methods for analyzing the interaction of steep
              ocean waves with offshore platforms, in the regime where the waves are
              relatively long but their amplitude is comparable to the platform
              cross-sectional dimensions.  This will extend our recent analysis which is
              restricted to a single vertical circular cylinder, and is expected to provide a
              quantitative understanding of the phenomenon of `ringing' which has been
              encountered in experiments and prototype measurements.    Appropriate
              time-domain panel methods will be used to solve for the first-order velocity
              potential in a prescribed incident wave system. From this linear solution the
              forcing function for the third-order potential will be computed on the free
              surface, and the resulting inhomogeneous free-surface condition will be solved
              by a second application of the panel method.  In the latter application a
              relatively large number of free-surface panels are required, and it will
              therefore be very effective to make use of the Order-N Laplace solver FASTLAP. 
              The corresponding wave loads and integrated forces and moments will then be
              computed, both for simple and practical structures, and compared with existing
              measurements.
