Abstract    :
              This research involves studies of atmospheric composition by measuring twilight
              airglow emissions.  By measuring  the decay in selected atmospheric emission
              rates as the solar depression angle increases, the temperature and product  of
              density and integrated solar flux can be determined.  The use of two look
              directions aids in the separation of the  density integrated solar flux
              product.  Two narrow band tilting filter photometers are deployed to obtain the
              data.   The objectives of the research are to quantify the variations in
              temperature and density, relate these changes to solar  EUV flux, discover how
              variations due to dynamics are discernible from that due to the solar
              variation, and to give  input to the models so that they are able to explain
              the rapid composition variations.
