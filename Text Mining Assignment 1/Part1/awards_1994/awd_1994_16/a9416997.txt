Abstract    :
              9416997  Yeh  The first international workshop on long-wave runup was held in 
              the Marine Science Center of the University of Southern  California at Catalina
              Island, CA, on 15-17 August 1990.  The  primary application of the research
              discussed was in tsunami  runup and flooding and tsunami hazard mitigation. 
              The workshop  resulted in a renewed interest in research on long-wave runup, 
              and significantly facilitated international research  collaboration in this
              area.    During 1992, 1993 and 1994 four major tsunamis occurred causing 
              significant property damage and many fatalities: the Nicaraguan  tsunami in
              September 1992, the Flores Island (the Philippines)  tsunami  in December 1992,
              the Hokkaido tsunami in July 1993, and  the Java tsunami in June 1994.    This
              workshop is to be held in September 1995 at the Friday  Harbor Laboratory of
              the University of Washington.  This  laboratory is in the San Juan Islands,
              approximately 70 miles  north of Seattle.  The objectives of this workshop are
              to: (1)  Review and update knowledge on long-wave runup, and the  experience
              gained through field surveys of the recent major  tsunamis, (2) Compare
              analytical and numerical model predictions  with experimental data for
              benchmark problems, and (3) Discuss  future research directions in terms of
              tsunami hazard mitigation.  ***
