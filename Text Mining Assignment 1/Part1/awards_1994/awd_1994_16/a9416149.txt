Abstract    :
              9416149  Shinozuka  The objective of this research is to significantly improve 
              the tools, methods, and procedures for analyzing and  evaluating the seismic
              performance of lifelines using data  from the Northridge earthquake.  System
              performance will be  measured in terms of physical damage, system functional 
              performance, extent of postearthquake repair/restoration  effort and attendant
              down-time.      The research undertaken will: (1) enhance the existing 
              database on geological, soil, and topographical conditions  in the area
              pertinent to the Los Angeles Department of Water  & Power (LADWP) systems, as
              well as the database of physical  and operational characteristics of the LADWP
              systems, (2)  develop a database of the Northridge earthquake ground  motion
              and the resulting LADWP system performance, (3)  analyze and evaluate the
              seismic performance of the LADWP  water and electric power systems, and (4)
              validate,  calibrate and improve the tools, models and procedures.  The 
              improved procedures can then be used to better predict  lifeline performance in
              future earthquakes.  The  effectiveness of the retrofit measures implemented
              after the  San Fernando earthquake will be examined based upon analysis  and to
              the extent that the existing data permits.    This research will significantly
              enhance the quality and  quantity of the lifeline seismic performance knowledge
              base,  as well as the performance modeling capability, and will  allow better
              evaluation of the seismic performance of  lifeline systems.  In addition, the
              information on seismic  performance on lifelines serves as crucial input to be
              used  by social scientists and economists for the evaluation of  the
              socio-economic impact of lifeline failures.    This is a Northridge Earthquake
              project involving EQE  International and Princeton University.  ***
