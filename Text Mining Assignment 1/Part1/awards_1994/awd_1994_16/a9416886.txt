Abstract    :
                This three-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative research in
              theoretical community ecology between Robert D. Holt of the University of
              Kansas and Michael Hochberg of the Ecole Normale Superieure's Ecology
              Laboratory in Paris, France.  The project links an NSF-funded Long-Term Project
              in Environmental Biology to the  biodiversity research program supported by the
              French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).  The research project is
              motivated by problems in conservation biology arising from removal of native
              predators from communities and the introduction of exotic predators into
              communities.  The investigators propose to study the consequences of predator
              manipulation from detailed analyses of community models.  These communities
              consist of a small number of species interacting in a prescribed manner. In
              their analyses of these models, the investigators will address issues such as
              unlinked food chains, predators feeding on competing and non competing prey,
              and pairs of predator species attacking pairs of prey.   The U.S. investigator
              brings to this collaboration considerable expertise in general ecological
              theory.  This is complemented by the French investigator's research on models
              tailored to empirical population studies in conservation biology.  The
              proposal's focus on predator removals and additions has conservation and
              biological control implications.  Its results may lead to improved practices in
              environmental management.
