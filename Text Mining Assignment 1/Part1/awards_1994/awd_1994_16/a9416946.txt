Abstract    :
              9416946  Ruckle    This award supports a three-year cooperative research project
              between  Dr. William Ruckle of Clemson University and Dr. Kensaku Kikuta  of
              Toyama University.  The objective of this cooperative research  project is to
              study search games on weighted graphs and their  applications.  Some of their
              activities will be to (1) construct various  search models on weighted graphs;
              (2) find formulas for solutions to  games on certain kinds of graphs; (3) find
              methods to reduce games  on complicated graphs to games on simpler graphs of
              less developed  and developing economies; (4) find methods to compute
              approximate  solutions; (5) find upper and lower bounds to the value of certain
               games on graphs; and (6) reduce the complexity of searches.    This proposal
              brings together research scientists from two countries  working on applied
              mathematics.  By combining their expertises, the  two groups can achieve a
              deeper understanding and more rapid  progress than can either group alone. 
              Therefore, this proposal fulfills  the objectives of the Program in its
              exchange and transfer of scientific  knowledge through an international
              collaboration.  ***
