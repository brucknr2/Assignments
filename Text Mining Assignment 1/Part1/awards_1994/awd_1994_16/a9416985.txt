Abstract    :
              Aller, Lawrence  9416985  Aller has obtained high dispersion spectra
              (360-1005nm) of planetary nebulae with the Hamilton Eschelle spectrograph at
              Lick Observatory from earlier NSF-supported research.  His group will document
              and publish these spectra so they are available to the general astronomical
              research community.  ***
