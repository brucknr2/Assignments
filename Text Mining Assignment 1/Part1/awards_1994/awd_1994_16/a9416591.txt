Abstract    :
              The PIs uill define the global-scale ionospheric-thermospheric  system with a
              focus on diurnal characteristics and seasonal  controls under solar maximum
              conditions.  Using data from SUNDIAL,  the PI will provide comprehensive
              seasonal coverage of the solar  maximum period.  Analysis will establish the
              weather and  climatology of the ionospheric-thermospheric system for
              spring/fall  equinoxes and summer/winter solstices under solar maximum 
              conditions.  Data will also establish boundary conditions on the  NCAR TIE-GCM
              coordinated modeling efforts, which should define  model inputs on the EUV and
              x-ray regions of the solar spectrum, as  well as the components of the
              thermospheric tides, their amplitudes  and their phases.  Project results will
              advance understanding of  thermospheric winds, electric fields, and ionospheric
              density  distributions, and establish and important baseline for defining 
              weather and climatology of the ionospheric-thermospheric system for  all
              seasons of the solar cycle.***
