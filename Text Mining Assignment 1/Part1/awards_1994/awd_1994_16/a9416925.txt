Abstract    :
              9416925  Bernard    This U.S.-Czech cooperative research project between Dr.
              John  Bernard of Ithaca College and Dr. Karel Fiala of the Institute of 
              Landscape Ecology, Czech Academy of Sciences, will address the  development of
              clonal plant populations in normal, unpolluted  systems to populations growing
              in polluted systems.  The polluted  systems to be studies will feature:  1)
              mountain forest systems  impacted by acid deposition and 2) wetland marsh
              systems affected  by sewage, landfill, or agricultural sources that produce
              higher  loads of decomposing organic matter.  The researchers intend to 
              produce an analysis of the effects of pollution on clonal plants  in these two
              natural ecosystems by comparing their observations  of natural and perturbed
              settings and laboratory environments  both in the U.S. and the Czech Republic. 
              Results should yield a  rich new source of data on plant response to levels of
              pollution.    This project in population biology fulfills the program objective
               of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in  the United
              States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary  talents and pool research
              resources in areas of strong mutual  interest and competence.   ***
