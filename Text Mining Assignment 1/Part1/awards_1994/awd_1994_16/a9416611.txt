Abstract    :
              This project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry  Program,
              focusses on fundamental investigations of the electron  transfer chemistry of
              organometallic compounds of interest as  representative reaction intermediates
              in catalytic processes.   During the tenure of this three-year continuing
              grant, Professor  Geiger and his students at the University of Vermont will
              study the  effects of structure on the electrochemical reactivity of 
              organometallic compounds containing 17 and 19 valence electrons  (17e, 19e). 
              Using a broad suite of electrochemical and  spectroscopic probes of structure
              and dynamics, the Vermont  investigators will explore the fundamental chemistry
              of these  systems.  Additionally, they will develop new, fiber optic based 
              infrared and near-infrared spectroelectrochemical techniques and  apply them to
              these studies.    This fundamental research addresses questions of how the
              structure  of organometallic compounds, particularly those of cobalt and 
              rhodium containing 17 and 19 valence electrons, affects their  electron
              transfer properties.  These questions are important to a  greater understanding
              of the basic chemistry of these systems and  the potential utility of this
              class of compounds in analytical  sensors, photooptical devices, conducting
              polymers, and  electrocatalysis.  Additionally, this research facilitates the 
              development of new spectroelectrochemical probes for the study of  interfacial
              electron transfer that are expected to find broad  application.
