Abstract    :
              9416747  Stolper       This is a request for an Accomplishment Based Renewal 
              (ABR) to continue the study of volatiles in basalts.  This  is important
              because small amounts of water and carbon  dioxide in the mantle have a large
              effect on the amount of  melting and the composition of magmas.  The research
              will  focus on the amount of water and carbon dioxide, the ratio  of deuterium
              to hydrogen, and the abundance of trace  elements in back-arc basin basalts. 
              They will determine the  isotopic composition of basalts to understand the
              effect of  the variable composition of the mantle above a subducting  plate on
              the compositions of lavas.  They will also conduct  experiments to understand
              the effect of water on the melting  of mantle rocks.  ***
