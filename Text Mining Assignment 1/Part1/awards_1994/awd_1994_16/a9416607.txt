Abstract    :
              9416607   von der Lippe  The Massachusetts public higher education system
              requests support  from NSF for connection of Bristol Community College, Holyoke
               Community College, Mt. Wachusett Community college, North Shore  Community
              College, Quinsigamond Community College, Worcester  State College to NEARnet
              the mid-level network that serves the  New England area.  A primary goal of
              NEARnet is to facilitate  collaborative projects and sharing of resources
              between  institution, including those outside the state.    NEARnet will
              provide operations management and information  services and it will give the
              universities and colleges a  connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45
              million bits per  second) National Backbone network.    The each of the
              universities has written a description of its  organization and a statement of
              the benefits of Internet access  that it expects including: greater
              functionality and network  speed to be able to access supercomputers,
              libraries, and make  file transfers along with being able to implement a more
              reliable  mail system. Students and faculty research will benefit from the 
              links.  This is also a unique opportunity for the schools to  explore
              innovative educational resources.  Their diversity will  expose NEARnet to a
              broader range of user requirements.  Nearnet  will use the information obtained
              by serving this diverse group  for the benefit of New England's academic and
              research community.
