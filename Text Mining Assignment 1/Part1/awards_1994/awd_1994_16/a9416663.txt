              Colorado  "A New Method for Synchronizing the Time of Networked Computers"   
              This is a four year project to continue investigation of new  methods for
              synchronizing the time of networked computers.  It  includes work on server
              algorithms, statistical analysis programs  and simple time client software. 
              The effort is a continuation of  a successful two year project the principal
              investigator is now  completing.
