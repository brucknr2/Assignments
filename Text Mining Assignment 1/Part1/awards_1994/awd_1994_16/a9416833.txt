Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic  Chemistry Program
              supports research on sulfur, oxygen, and  nitrogen transfer reactions by Dr.
              Robert G. Bergman of the  Department of Chemistry, University of
              California-Berkeley.   Transition metal complexes capable of transferring
              heteroatoms,  such as sulfur, oxygen, and alkylated nitrogen, between organic 
              molecules and metal centers will be studied.  Initial work will  focus on
              organotantalum complexes which remove these atoms and  groups from
              three-membered organic ring compounds, creating  hydrocarbons and new metal
              complexes with heteroatom-metal  multiple bonds.  After this initial phase, the
              project will  define the mechanism of these reactions in preparation for 
              identifying other metal complexes which can run these reactions  in reverse
              catalytically, thus generating complexes which can  convert alkenes into
              species such as epoxides, thiiranes and  aziridines.    The transfer of
              heteroatoms such as sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen  between organic molecules and
              transition metal centers is a  fundamental chemical process in organic and
              biological enzyme  chemistry.  The results should lead to the design of
              reactions  useful in organic synthesis in the chemical and pharmaceutical 
              industries, and to methods for removal of sulfur, oxygen, and  nitrogen from
              fuels, thus reducing production of environmentally  harmful sulfur and nitrogen
              oxides from this source.
