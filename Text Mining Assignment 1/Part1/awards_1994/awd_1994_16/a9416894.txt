Abstract    :
              9416894  Carton  In this project, the PI will continue studies of interannual 
              changes in the upper thermocline waters of the Atlantic Ocean.   Previous work
              has focused on determining the Sea Surface  Temperature (SST) in the tropical
              Atlantic, including effects of  rainfall and runoff.  In this follow-on, the PI
              will focus on the  role of wind stress and other surface forcing parameters, on
              SST,  with particular emphasis on the tropics for the three decades of  the
              1960's through the 1980's, using a primitive equation model.   An important
              question is to include effects of upper ocean  salinity.  Results will further
              clarify issues of both modeling and  air temperature and precipitation over
              both Africa and Brazil.  The  assimilation package to be developed will be a
              useful contribution  to the field of ocean modeling.  ***
