Abstract    :
              9416265  Chopra  The objectives of this project are to "measure" two  important
              properties--fundamental vibration period and modal  damping ratios-of some
              forty buildings from their recorded  motions during the Northridge earthquake
              and other recent  earthquakes.  These buildings, shaken strongly by ground 
              motions with peak accelerations between 0.15g and 0.82g,  would provide
              information directly relevant to earthquake  resistant design of buildings in
              contrast to much of the  existing data which are for smaller amplitudes of
              motion.    The vibration properties will be identified from the  recorded
              motions of the buildings using system  identification procedures. These results
              from the Northridge  earthquake and other recent earthquakes, combined with 
              similar data available from the 1971 San Fernando  earthquake, will create the
              most comprehensive database  which can be easily updated after every major
              earthquake.    This database will be used to evaluate and improve:  (1)  code
              formulas for estimating the fundamental vibration  period used in calculating
              the design base shear and lateral  forces; and (2) current recommendations for
              damping values  used in dynamic analysis.  The period formulas in the 1994  UBC
              and the 1990 SEAOC "blue book" were developed in 1975 as  part of the ATC-3
              project, based largely on motions of  buildings recorded during the 1971 San
              Fernando earthquake.  Similarly, the damping values used widely were originally
               recommended by Newmark and Hall in 1978.    This project will culminate in: 
              (1) formulas for estimating  the fundamental vibration period of buildings
              using  different materials--steel, R/C, masonry etc.--and various  structural
              systems--moment resisting frames, shear walls  etc.; and (2) recommendations
              for modal damping ratios for  different categories of buildings, depending on
              response  amplitude and, if appropriate, on mode number.    This is a
              Northridge earthquake project.  ***
