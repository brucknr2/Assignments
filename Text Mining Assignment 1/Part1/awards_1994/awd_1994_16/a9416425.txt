Abstract    :
              9416425  Scawthorn  This  project is being funded as part of the National 
              Earthquake  Hazards  Reduction Program's investigation into  the  causes  and 
              effects of the January 17, 1994 Northridge earthquake.  The study  will involve
              the analysis of data collected by such organizations  as  the  California
              Department of Insurance on  insurance  losses  sustained  in the earthquake. 
              Analysis of this information  will  permit more accurate determination of the
              effects of deductibles,  and  of the relation of building shake loss to other
              losses, such  as  fire,  inland  marine,  and workers  compensation.   Analyses
               involving statistical and GIS techniques will include examination  of  such 
              questions  as: What is the distribution  of  losses  by  geographical  area,
              and by soil type?  To what  extent  did  poor  soils  play a role in damage? 
              What is the distribution of losses  by structural age and type?  What is the
              relative contribution of  structural  damage  to  overall losses, as  opposed 
              to  contents  damage and loss of use? How did ultimate insurance claims compare
               against initial building inspector estimates of damage?  ***
