Abstract    :
              9416685  Lyle       The PI will compile ODP/DSDP data into a more detailed and 
              reliable estimate of pelagic carbonate burial through the Neogene  than is now
              available.  So far the estimates are only  approximations and severely limit
              our ability to understand the  processes that initiated the late Cenozoic
              glaciations and to  estimate atmospheric CO2 variations.  The work will lead to
               better estimates of global pelagic carbonate mass accumulation  rates and
              changes in global weathering cycles and their impact on  atmospheric CO2
              composition.  The carbonate sedimentary pattern  maps will also help
              paleoceanographic interpretations.  ***
