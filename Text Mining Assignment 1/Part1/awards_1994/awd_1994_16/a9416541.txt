Abstract    :
               The proposed research requests funds to investigate methods for improving the
              performance of thermoelectric refrigeration elements by reducing the thermal
              conductivity of bismuth telluride based alloys.  The research proposes to
              significantly reduce the thermal conductivity of bismuth-telluride elements
              through enhanced powder processing techniques.  The proposal was  submitted as
              a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) as a result of conservations
              between the PI and the Thermal Transport and Thermal Processing Program
              Director.  The qualifications of the PI and his ability to perform fundamental
              work in this area are excellent.  The relevance of the proposal, the fact that
              subject area is one of increasing importance, and the uncertainty of the
              outcome make this particular proposal an excellent candidate for the SGER
              program.
