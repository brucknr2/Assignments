Abstract    :
              9416326  Hager    This project will assess the application of the fault
              propagation fold (FPF) model to  understanding potential earthquake hazards. 
              The kinematics of the FPF model are commonly  used to explain the occurrence of
              earthquakes in connection with blind thrusts, but the mechanics  of the FPF
              model have received relatively little study.  This study will first determine
              the  geometry and co-seismic slip of the rupture plane of the Northridge event,
              then determine  whether slower anelastic deformation is either permitted or
              required.  These finding will be  incorporated into a finite element model to
              produce an alternative mechanical model to the FPF.   It will be determined if
              a basal detachment fault, a prerequisite of the FPF model, is necessary  or
              even capable of generating large earthquakes.  The results of this study will
              aid understanding  of earthquake mechanics, the geometry of the structures
              beneath the Los Angeles basin and San  Fernando Valley, and the potential for
              earthquake hazards in regions of blind thrusts.
