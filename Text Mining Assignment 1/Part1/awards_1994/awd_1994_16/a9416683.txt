Abstract    :
              Buonsanto    This project will use Millstone Hill incoherent scatter radar data
              and Fabry-Perot interferometer  data to study ion-neutral coupling and
              thermospheric dynamics.  A primary goal is to perform  a statistical study to
              derive an improved value for the O+, O collision frequency.  This  parameter is
              important in the application of radar techniques for measuring thermospheric
              neutral  winds.  Recent work at Millstone Hill has shown that horizontal
              gradients in the ion velocity  field and vertical neutral winds are large
              enough to have significant effects on the winds derived  from ion velocity
              measurements, even under quiet geomagnetic conditions.  This study will 
              quantify the effects of both horizontal ion velocity gradients and vertical
              neutral winds on both  the derived collision frequency and the wind climatology
              at Millstone Hill.  The new results will  be used to assess the accuracy of
              earlier work carried out using the servo model method,  including the tidal
              decomposition of winds over a full solar cycle.
