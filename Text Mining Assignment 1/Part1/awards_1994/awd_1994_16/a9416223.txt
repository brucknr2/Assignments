Abstract    :
              9416223  Anderson    This research is to understand the site, source and path
              effect  of the Northridge earthquake for strong motion prediction and  seismic
              hazard reduction in the Los Angeles region.  Preliminary  work on a composite
              source model generated very realistic synthetic  strong motion seismograms at
              several locations.  This work will be  continued and completed for several
              strong ground motion parameters  including peak acceleration and velocity, and
              Fourier and response  spectral amplitudes.  Then the work will focus on finding
              the  optimal source model parameters and concentrate on site effects, 
              expressed as a Fourier spectral ratio of weak motions in  aftershocks to
              predicted ground motions for a flat-layered half  space.  This contrasts with
              the more usual reference, for spectral  ratios, of a nearby rock station or a
              network average.  This  project is a contribution to the National Earthquake
              Hazard  Reduction Program and is supported by the Northridge Earthquake 
              Emergency Appropriation.  ***
