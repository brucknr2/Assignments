Abstract    :
              9416007  Alt       This project will examine the role of sulfur in alteration 
              of ocean ultramafic rocks, in order to constrain the conditions  for formation
              of pure metals, oxides and sulfides, which are  widely found in continental
              serpentinites.  ***
