Abstract    :
              9416458  French  This  project is being funded as part of the National 
              Earthquake  Hazards  Reduction Program's investigation into  the  causes  and 
              consequences of the January 17, 1994 Northridge earthquake.  Land  use 
              planning  has been mandated by the state of  California  for  nearly  thirty
              years, and since the 1971 San Fernando  earthquake  local  governments  have 
              been  required  to  include  earthquake  hazards  in  their local land use
              plans.  These  plans,  however,  vary  in quality.  This project will
              investigate the relationship  between the quality of land use plans aimed at
              minimizing  future  earthquake damage; how damage varied among communities
              within the  San  Fernando  Valley  following the Northridge  earthquake;  and 
              changes in plans following the earthquake.  ***
