Abstract    :
              9416748  Wheless      This  project  consists  of a study  of  physical 
              processes  related  to  buoyant estuarine discharges using the  Mellor- 
              Blumberg  three-dimensional primitive equation  model.   The  numerical 
              simulations are designed to examine the  response  of an estuarine coastal
              plume and the associated inner shelf  circulation  to external forcing and the
              effects  of  mixing  and  turbulence.  Three model scenarios will  be  used, 
              the  first  representing the wide estuary-broad shelf  system  of  Chesapeake 
              Bay,  the second representing the  large  river-  shallow  shelf  system of the
              Mississippi  River,   and  the  third representing the large river-steep shelf
              system of the  Columbia River.
