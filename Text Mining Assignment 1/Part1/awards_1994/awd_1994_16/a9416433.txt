Abstract    :
              9416433  Stokoe  Several soil and rock sites shaken by the Northridge Earthquake
               of January 17, 1994 exhibited unusually high ground surface  accelerations.   
              The insitu portion of the project is basically one dimensional;  that is, only
              a vertical profile of small-strain material  stiffness, in terms of shear wave
              velocity, will be measured at  each site.  No investigation of the lateral
              variability of the  stiffness profiles is proposed.  The one -dimensional (1-D)
               approach is taken due to the one year time frame for the project,  also
              because of the high cost involved in installing numerous  boreholes that would
              be necessary to develop two-dimensional (2-  D) profiles using borehole seismic
              techniques.    The objective is to develop 2-D (and in one case, 3-D) stiffness
               profiles.  Borehole seismic techniques (such as crosshole  testing, downhole
              testing or suspension logging) will not be  employed.  Instead, the
              nonintrusive SASW technique involving  Rayleigh-type surface waves is utilized.
               The technique is  nonintrusive because both the source and receivers are
              placed on  the ground surface.  Measurement of surface wave dispersion is 
              performed in the field.  Forward modeling is then used in the  laboratory to
              determine the shear wave velocity profile at the  site.  In addition to the
              cost benefit of being nonintrusive, an  important benefit of SASW testing is
              that it can be used to  measure softer layers sandwiched between stiffer
              layers, a  potentially critical measurement in engineering studies.    This
              project involves SASW testing (spectral analysis of surface  waves) at two
              sites:  The Tarzana site and the La Cienega and I-  10 highway interchange.  In
              both cases, unusually high ground  shaking was measured with surface stations. 
              At each site, in  situ seismic testing will be performed using a high-energy
              mobile  vibrator (Vibroseis).   This source, coupled with multi-channel 
              recording of four or more 1-Hz geophones, should permit profiles  on the order
              of 100 to 300 m in lateral  dimension (depending on  the site) to be developed
              to a depth on the order of 30 to 60 m.  In the case of the Tarzana site,
              profiling will be performed in  both the north-south and east-west directions,
              allowing a 3-D  image of the underground shear stiffness to be developed.   
              The results of this study have the potential to offer an  important
              contribution to the understanding of ground shaking  levels generated during
              the 1994 Northridge Earthquake as well as  to the development of cost-effective
              2-D and 3-D seismic  profiling for the prediction of ground response during
              future  earthquakes.  ***
