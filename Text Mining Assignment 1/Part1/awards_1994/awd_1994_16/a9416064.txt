Abstract    :
              9416064  Eckman         Recent evidence suggests that the areal biomass and 
              productivity of benthic microflora on the SAB shelf can be  comparable to, or
              exceed, that of phytoplankton through much  of the year.  in the project Dr.
              Eckman and collaborators  will assess the importance of benthic primary
              production and  its role in the biogeochemistry of the South Atlantic Bight 
              shelf sediments.  It is important to understand the  magnitude of benthic
              primary production, its variability in  space and time, and factors affecting
              benthic primary  production, because present models of continental shelf 
              export, biogeochemical cycles, and response to global change  do not include a
              contribution of organic matter from benthic  primary production.       The
              principal objectives of the proposed study are: 1)  to quantify the spatial and
              seasonal variability of benthic  microfloral biomass and productivity on the
              SAB shelf; 2) to  measure phytoplankton biomass and primary production in the 
              water column overlying the sediments so that the relative  role of seafloor
              microflora on the continental shelf any be  determined; 3) to examine the
              impact of benthic primary  production on solute exchanges between the sediments
              and the  water column of the shelf; and 4) to identify and quantify  the
              physical, biological and chemical properties of the  shelf environment that may
              influence benthic microalgal  biomass, primary production, and solute fluxes
              between the  sediments and the water column.
