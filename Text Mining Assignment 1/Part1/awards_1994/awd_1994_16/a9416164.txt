Abstract    :
              9416164  Wong  Reconnaissance of damage to telecommunications assets caused by 
              the Northridge earthquake confirmed that: (a) Countermeasures  (primarily
              lateral bracing)implemented since 1971 to protect  equipment against direct
              ground shaking effects were effective,  and (b) As a result, system integrity
              now depended on indirect  effects.  The major indirect effects identified were,
              for inside  plants, collateral building damage and dependency on support 
              lifelines; for outside plants, they were collateral damage to  other lifelines
              by virtue of collocation.    In this study, telecommunications performance data
              from the 1994  Northridge and the 1971 San Fernando earthquakes will be 
              evaluated and used to: (1) Assess the effectiveness of mitigation  procedures
              (e.g., equipment bracing) introduced between 1971-  1994; (2) Identify
              vulnerabilities in telecommunications systems  that remain unchanged since
              1971; (3) Quantify sources of such  vulnerabilities, with emphasis on indirect
              effects such as  collateral hazards, damage to outside plants and support 
              lifelines; and (4) Prioritize data/research needs based on the  impact of
              indirect-effects related disruptions on the  economics/recovery needs of
              telecommunications.    The study makes use of a recently developed computer
              simulation  tool that combines geographic information system technology with 
              state-of-the-art  seismic risk models, and is designed expressly  to quantify
              the effects of lifeline interaction on seismic  security of telecommunications
              system.    This research will contribute to improved security of 
              telecommunications systems which benefits the carriers, the  public,
              governments, private enterprises, emergency response, and  disaster recovery.  
               This is a Northridge Earthquake project.  ***
