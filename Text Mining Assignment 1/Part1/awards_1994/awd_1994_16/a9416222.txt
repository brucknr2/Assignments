Abstract    :
              9416222  Seeber    This project combines expertise in three areas to apply
              simultaneously earthquake and geologic  constraints in the construction of a
              three-dimensional deformation model for the Northridge area.   A
              state-of-the-art visualization and modelling algorithm will be used which
              allows the shape and  kinematics of structures to vary in all directions and
              applies deformation constraints in three  dimensions.  Surface and near-surface
              data from the oil industry will be combined with  Northridge aftershock data
              and data from prior seismicity.  These data will be incorporated into  the
              cross-sections constructed by collaborators to permit calculation of the
              convergence rates  across the Transverse Ranges-Los Angeles Basin, and the
              amount of slip and slip rates of hidden  thrusts.  The results of this study
              will greatly assist understanding of the subsurface structures  of the Los
              Angeles and San Fernando Valleys, and will provide much-needed geometrical and 
              kinematic constraints for seismic hazard interpretations.
