Abstract    :
              9416171  Murray  Numerous reports of fractures in beam flange-to-column  flange
              welds in steel moment resisting frames after the  Northridge earthquake suggest
              the need for a new connection  configuration.  No reports of end-plate moment
              connection  distress or failure are known.  In this project the endplate  and
              all-bolted moment connections will be studied to develop  an alternate to field
              welded connections.  Because both of  these connection types require tension
              bolts and the  associated problems with prying forces, a shim plate is  placed
              opposite the beam tension flange or the tee-stub  tension web.  Using the shim
              ensures that the bolt tension  will not increase until separation of the
              end-plate or tee  stub flange and the column flange occurs.  If the design is 
              such that the pretension force is sufficient to develop the  strength of the
              connected beam, in effect the connection is  tested at the time the bolts are
              tightened.    The project consists of three tasks:  Task I is a survey to 
              determine if end-plate or all-bolted moment connections  exhibited distress or
              failure because of the Northridge  earthquake.  Task II is the development of a
              design  procedure for shimmed end-plate and all-bolted moment  connections,
              which is a relatively uncomplicated procedure  because the effects of prying
              forces do not need to be  considered.  Task III is a set of four verification
              tests,  two for each connection type.  One test in each set will be  designed
              so the connection is the controlling limit state  and the second so the beam is
              controlling limit state.    Successful completion of the proposed research will
              result  in a steel beam-to-column moment connection which does not  require
              welding but with sufficient strength to resist large  forces from seismic
              events.    This is a Northridge Earthquake project.  ***
