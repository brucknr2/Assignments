Abstract    :
              9416679  Milliman  A workshop is planned to bring together leading workers in
              the  neritic and deep-sea carbonate systems to define future  directions that
              will allow the community to understand the marine  carbonate system in its
              entirety, particularly in the light of  changing sea level and climate.  A
              report to NSF is planned as  the understanding of the global carbonate budget
              and its  relationship to CO2 cycle are important stated objectives of  marine
              earth system history initiative.  Funds will pay partial  attendance cost of
              twenty five US and local expenses of five  foreign scientists.  ***
