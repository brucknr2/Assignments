Abstract    :
              9416344  Suppe    This project uses geological and geophysical data combined
              with advanced techniques of  structural modelling to obtain an integrated, self
              consistent solution for the three-dimensional  blind-thrust geometry, slip
              vectors, and loading of the faults of the Northridge and San Fernando 
              earthquakes and for other nearby blind thrust faults that may have been
              stressed by the closely  related Northridge and San Fernando events.  Refined
              fault geometries will be constrained by  will tested theoretical relationships
              between fault shape and associated fold shape.  The study  will also determine
              whether there are other nearby fault segments that could slip in damaging 
              earthquakes by using three-dimensional boundary element calculations to
              evaluate the stress  changes on these faults due to the San Fernando and
              Northridge events.  The results of this study  will provide subsurface maps and
              cross sections of the San Fernando Valley and surrounding  regions and will
              provide needed constraints on the presence and seismic potential of other blind
               faults in the region.
