Abstract    :
                9416690  Eshlemann    This proposal for connection of Western Maryland College
              to NSFNET  through SURAnet.  SURAnet is the midlevel network located in the 
              southern United States. These connections will provide operations  management
              and information services and it will give the college a  56 thousand bits per
              second connection to the NSFNET, a high  speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per
              second) National Backbone network.    The benefits of the NSFNET connection
              include e-mail between local  and remote researchers and educators, file
              transfer capability and  the ability to use remote computer resources.  Also
              the college  will have the ability to investigate innovation in educational 
              resources and incorporate them into their curricula.
