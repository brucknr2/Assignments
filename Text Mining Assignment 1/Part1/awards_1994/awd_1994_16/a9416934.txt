Abstract    :
              9416934  Mills    This award supports the participation of 11 U.S. scientists in
              a U.S.-  Japan seminar on Molecular Aspects of Pathogenicity, to be held at 
              the Mie Kohseinenkin Vacation Center at Ise-city, Japan from  September 24-29,
              1995.  The co-organizers are Dr. Dallice Mills of  Oregon State University and
              Professor Hitoshi Kunoh of Mie  University. The main theme of this seminar is
              the role of signal  transduction pathways in cell/cell communication and the 
              establishment of compatible and incompatible interactions between  hosts and
              their pathogens.  The proposed general topics to be  discussed include: new
              concepts regarding genic interactions between  plants and pathogens, the
              induction and regulation of signal  transduction pathways in pathogen
              morphogenesis and etiology, the  molecular characterization of pathogen
              elicitors and plant resistance  genes, the molecular and physiological basis of
              plant/microbe  recognition, the role of toxins in disease and host-pathogen
              specificity,  and the genetic engineering of host plant resistance to
              pathogens.    This meeting is the seventh in a series of U.S.-Japan seminars in
              this  field held over a period of almost 30 years.  Participants in the 
              seminars change through the years to reflect an appropriate pairing  between
              U.S. and Japanese scientists and the progress of the research.   The U.S.
              participants provide a broad cross section of expertise and  geographical
              representation in the general area of plant host/pathogen  interactions, and
              were selected on the basis of being the most active  researchers in the U.S. 
              Therefore, this proposal fulfills the objectives  of the Program in its
              exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge  through an international
              collaboration.  ***
