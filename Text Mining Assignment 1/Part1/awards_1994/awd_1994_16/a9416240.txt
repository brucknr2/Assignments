Abstract    :
              9416240  Hushmand  On October 9, 1993, new Federal minimum design standards for 
              Municipal Solid waste landfill Facilities (MSWLF) were released  which impacted
              the seismic design of landfills.  However, these  new standards combined little
              information and almost no  guidelines for establishing the seismic performance
              of landfills.  On January 17, 1994, the Northridge earthquake provided the
              first  recorded set of strong accelerations in the OII landfill, the  only
              landfill in the United States which is instrumented with  strong-motion
              recorders, thus providing a rare opportunity to  analyze a well-documented case
              history, and to develop guidelines  for the seismic performance of landfills.  
               The objective of the proposed research is to analyze the strong  motion
              recordings and the surveyed displacements at the OII  landfill after the 1994
              Northridge earthquake.  Several types of  dynamic analyses will be used to
              calculate the ground  accelerations, and the permanent ground displacements. 
              The  specific objectives are to determine the wave velocity and the  damping
              properties of landfill materials that simulate the  landfill response.  These
              backfitted data will be compared to the  wave velocities that are measured from
              geophysical and surface  wave measurement techniques, in an effort to assess
              the  applicability of the wave velocity measurements in extremely 
              heterogeneous media.  The method of analysis will include  conventional
              engineering methods (e.g. equivalent linear methods  such as QUAD4) and more
              advanced plasticity models and finite  element models such as LINOS. 
              Comprehensive models will be  developed that include nonlinear behavior of
              landfill materials,  two dimensional geometries, and wave propagation and
              reflection.  Recommendations will be made for the optimal way to monitor the 
              seismic performance of landfills.    The data collected and generated during
              this research will be in  digital format to the database of the Southern
              California  Earthquake Center at the University o f Southern California.  ***
