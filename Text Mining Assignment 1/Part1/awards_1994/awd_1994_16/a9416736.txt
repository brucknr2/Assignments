Abstract    :
              This document is a proposal to continue work which was initiated by Professor
              Manos  while he was head of the Atomic Beam Studies at the Plasma Physics
              Laboratory of Princeton University.  The neutral beam source at Princeton,
              though developed for studies of spacecraft  materials, was  quickly shown to be
              promising for fine-line, low-damage processing of semiconductors 1, a subject
              that  has been under aggressive study in Japanese corporate research
              laboratories.  The Princeton source,  because of the way in which it was
              configured during design, was not suitable to examine a wide range  of
              semiconductor process variables.  To continue these semiconductor studies at
              William and Mary  develop tools for wafer-scale production. This proposal is
              for a three year program of study which  will integrate plasma measurement,
              experimental surface characterization, and computational modeling  of
              low-energy, low-damage processing steps involving neutral atoms and molecules
              (and ions).  The work  will be performed at the College of William and Mary
              with close collaboration with a number of outside  advisors  from industry.
