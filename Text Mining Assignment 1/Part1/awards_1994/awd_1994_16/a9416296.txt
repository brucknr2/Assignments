              Feasibility Study: Coring Last Interglacial Deposits,  Bristol Bay, Alaska   
              The aim of this research is to test the feasibility of obtaining a  long (ca.
              40 M) sediment core from the northeastern coast of  Bristol Bay, a tidal
              estuary in southwestern Alaska.  The service  of a drill rig designed for
              coring, but untested for  paleoenvironmental and geochronological applications
              will be  contracted for this effort.  Recovered core material will be  analyzed
              for paleomagnetic, tephrostratigraphic, and physical  properties.    The core
              site near Dillingham is adjacent to well-studied coastal-  bluff exposures,
              where the age of sediments appears to be  exceptionally well constrained.  By
              extending the stratigraphic  record into the subsurface, the core will be used
              to test the age  assignment.  Most importantly, sediments dating to the last 
              interglaciation should be found at relatively shallow depth and the  Old Crow
              tephra (ca. 140 ka) below that.  Well-dated stratigraphic  records of the last
              interglaciation are rare in northern North  America, yet are critically needed
              for testing climate models under  warmer-than-present conditions and for
              comparison with other long-  term paleoclimate records, including the new
              Greenland ice cores.
