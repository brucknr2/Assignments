Abstract    :
              Abstract   Medical Center of Delaware - G. W. Keever   Connection to NSFNET 
              Proposal No. NCR-9416922  The Medical Center of Delaware's Wide Area Network
              links five  main campuses, as well as several satellite primary care and home 
              healthcare facilities throughout the state.  With an Internet  connection at
              the Center, pharmacists will be able to exchange  protocols for new drugs,
              scientists can query their colleagues at  other institutions on specific
              research questions, legal data  bases and case studies, and physicians
              participating in clinical  trials can log patient-care information and receive
              updates  without leaving their offices.    The Center will purchase and install
              the gateway hardware  necessary to make an SMDS connection to the Internet by 
              connecting to PREPnet, the closet mid-level network .    Because of the
              Center's ever expanding involvement in research  and other areas, the
              requirements for connectivity are no longer  met by dial-up facilities. 
              Providing a direct connection to the  NSFNET has become increasingly important
              to meet the Center's  existing and future needs.
