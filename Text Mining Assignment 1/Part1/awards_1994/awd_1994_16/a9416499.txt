Abstract    :
              9416499  Olshansky  This  project is being funded as part of the National 
              Earthquake  Hazards  Reduction Program's investigation into  the  causes  and 
              effects of the January 17, 1994 earthquake.  The primary research  question 
              is: In what ways can planning reduce earthquake  risks?  Using  the  Los 
              Angeles area as an example,  this  project  will  document and evaluate the
              ways in which planning has been used as  an earthquake hazard reduction
              earthquake strategy.  Using a case  study   approach,  the  project  will 
              examine   the   historical  development of policy and its effect on local
              planning decisions.  How  did national and state policy changes catalyzed by
              the  1971  earthquake come back to affect the scale of damage that  occurred 
              in adjacent areas in 1994?  ***
