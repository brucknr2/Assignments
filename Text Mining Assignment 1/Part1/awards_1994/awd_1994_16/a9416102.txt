Abstract    :
              9416102  Lelong    The small-scale signal in the ocean is made up of internal
              gravity  waves and three-dimensional turbulence.  There is however,  increasing
              evidence that another type of motion, which can account  for the potential
              vorticity at this scales, is also present.  The  role of the small-scale
              potential vorticity component (also called  "vortical") remain unclear.  The
              objective of the present study is  to assess the role of the vortical mode and
              its relative importance  to the small scale dynamics.  Numerical simulations
              will be  performed to help observationalists to identify the different 
              signatures expected of the vortical and wave components.
