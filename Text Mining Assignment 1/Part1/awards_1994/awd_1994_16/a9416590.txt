Abstract    :
              9416590  Emlet         This research will provide an approach with combined 
              laboratory manipulation and field experimentation for  examining ecological and
              evolutionary connections between  the two least understood components of the
              life cycles of  benthic marine invertebrates: larvae and juveniles.  Work  will
              examine the effect of larval nutrition on juvenile  performance in the field, a
              feature ignored in the studies  of recruitment biology.  Studies on recruitment
              biology are  currently focused on larval supply, and this research will  show
              whether there is a need to consider larval condition  and its influence on
              juvenile performance to explain control  of benthic populations by larval
              input.  Larvae will be fed  in the lab on cultured algal rations at levels
              approximating  coastal oceanic conditions.  By experimenting with an array  of
              invertebrates with different modes of life (sessile,  mobile) and different
              trophic modes (suspension feeders,  herbivores, predators), the work determines
              whether effects  on juvenile performance apply broadly.       This project
              provide field tests of the long  hypothesized (survival) advantages of greater
              energystores  and larger size at metamorphosis which are basic components  of
              most verbal and quantitative models of life history  evolution of marine
              invertebrates.  The approach is  strengthened by the use of species with 3
              different  developmental patterns (pelagic feeding larvae, pelagic  nonfeeding
              larvae, and benthic encapsulated juveniles), in  that it will be possible to
              determine if the hypothesized  advantages readily apply to all types of
              development  included.
