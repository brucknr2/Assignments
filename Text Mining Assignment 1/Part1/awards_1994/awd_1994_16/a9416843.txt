Abstract    :
                This  U.S.-Mexico award will support a collaboration between  the Institute of
              Astronomy, University of Hawaii and the  Instituto de Astronomia, Universidad
              Nacional Autonoma de  Mexico (UNAM), on adaptive optics.   The research groups 
              will be headed by  Dr. J. Elon Graves, University of Hawaii  and Dr. Luis Salas
              Cazales, for UNAM.  Adaptive optics (AO) is a real-time technique to compensate
               for image degradation produced by the turbulent atmosphere.  It requires a
              reference light source or `guide star` to  sense the wave-front distortions and
              a deformable mirror to  correct them.  The Institute of Astronomy in Hawaii has
               developed a unique system of adaptive optics for astronomy,  and are now
              developing a secondary mirror technology to be  used with the new generation of
              telescopes.  Going from  present adaptive systems to systems which use adaptive
               secondary mirrors will result in very large improvements in  the performance
              of  telescopes.  For the proposed  collaboration between the two Institutes,
              the Mexican side  will benefit from the expertise at the University of Hawaii, 
              while the U.S. side will benefit from the optical  capabilities at the UNAM
              Institute, which will allow both  institutions to develop deformable
              secondaries for the new  generation of large telescopes.
