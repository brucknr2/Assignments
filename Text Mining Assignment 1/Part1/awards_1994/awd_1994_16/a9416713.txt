Abstract    :
                This three-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative research in
              electrochemical systems between Mark Orazem of the University of Florida and
              Claude Deslouis of the Laboratory for the Physics of Liquids and
              Electrochemistry at Pierre and Marie Curie  University.  The investigators will
              apply new statistical techniques and models using impedance spectroscopy. 
              Their objective is to increase the amount and quality of physical and chemical
              information that can be gained from impedance measurements.  Impedance
              spectroscopy has been established as a useful tool for characterization of
              electrochemical and electronic systems. The project addresses difficulties in
              interpretation of impedance spectra data through application of French
              experimental techniques.  Based on the use of driving forces, the experimental
              techniques isolate the phenomena responsible for the electrochemical behavior. 
              The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in statistical
              interpretive techniques and models.  This is complemented by the experimental
              and measurement techniques developed by the French investigator and his group
              in Paris.  Electrochemical processes play a fundamental role in many
              technological areas.  The project will lead to new, user-friendly methods for
              data interpretations for use by the electrochemical research community.
