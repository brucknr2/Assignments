Abstract    :
              9416119  Hauksson    This research is to investigate the effect of lateral
              variations  in seismic velocity on the amplitude of damaging shear wave energy 
              within the Los Angeles basin from the 1994 Northridge earthquake in  order to
              resolve some of the questions of source versus structure  as a cause of the
              damaging motion.  A horizontal acceleration of  0.93 g was measured at Santa
              Monica and accelerations greater than  0.4 g were measured at other sites
              within the L.A. basin in phases  that followed the direct S-wave by more than 5
              seconds.  These  sites were farther from the source than sites within the Santa
               Monica Mountains that recorded smaller accelerations.  This  complexity in the
              pattern of peak accelerations may be caused by  complications of the source
              rupture, for example directivity of a  later sub-event, and may also be caused
              by waveform propagation  effects through a complicated basin structure.  This
              work is a step  towards the ultimate goal of creating a 3-D model for general
              use  for locating earthquakes within the Los Angeles basin and  predicting the
              ground motion from earthquake scenarios from other  source regions.  This
              project is a contribution to the National  Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program
              and is supported by the  Northridge Earthquake Emergency Appropriation.  ***
