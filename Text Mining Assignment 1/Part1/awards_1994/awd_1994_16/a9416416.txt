Abstract    :
              9416416  Mader  This  project is being funded as part of the National 
              Earthquake  Hazards  Reduction Program's investigation into  the  causes  and 
              effects  of  the  January  17, 1994 Northridge  earthquake.   The  objective of
              the project is to evaluate the effectiveness of  the  City  of Los Angeles
              Recovery and Reconstruction Plan as a  guide  to  city actions after the
              Northridge earthquake.  As part of the  evaluation, the project team will
              explore the roles of the city's  departments,   agencies,   and  ad  hoc  
              organizations   created  specifically to assist recovery, and the value of
              ordinances  and  procedures prepared in advance for immediate implementation
              after  the  earthquake.   Actions pertaining to long-term  recovery  and 
              rebuilding will be emphasized, but the team will also look at the  impact of
              the plan on emergency response.  ***
