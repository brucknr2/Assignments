Abstract    :
              9416809  Whitelaw    This project's objectives fall into three groups:   
              Descriptive objective: to develop a technically sound, but intuitively
              accessible, framework and language for describing and assessing the multiple
              relationships between a forested ecosystem and a regional economy that can be
              applied to different ecosystems and regional economies.    Explanatory
              objective:  to improve understanding of the factors that influence the multiple
              relationships between forested ecosystems and regional economies.   
              Institutional-communicative objective: to lay the institutional foundation for
              (1) providing resource managers, policymakers, and the public with effective
              tools for describing and assessing the economic effects of changes in
              resource-management policy, (2) undertaking further cross-site research
              regarding the relationships between ecosystems and regional economies, and (3)
              integrating economics research with the research of other disciplines.    The
              proposed project will pursue these objectives by implementing, for these six
              LTER sites.
