Abstract    :
              9405534  Louie                            This research will test Cenozoic
              extension models for the  southern Great Basin of Nevada with large- and
              small-scale,  multidisciplinary geophysical investigations.  Geophysical
              methods  will outline the development of small alluvial and lacustrine  basins,
              which can constrain the timing and nature of regional  tectonic activity.  The
              stratigraphy of basins east of Death  Valley, California, may be diagnostic of
              the mode and timing of  extension.  Constrained by velocity structure, this
              research will  test the geophysical and sedimentary features proposed by
              differing  Cenozoic tectonic models.  In addition, this research will provide 
              geophysical field experience to undergraduate and graduate  geological sciences
              classes, enhancing several degree programs at  the University of Nevada, Reno,
              and Pennsylvania State University.  ***
