Abstract    :
                  9416530  Tajirian  The objectives of this project are to study the response
              of base-  isolated structures using computer simulation and to evaluate their 
              current design code provisions in light of the strong-motion data  obtained
              during the Northridge earthquake.  The response of four  isolated structures
              located in Los Angeles area instrumented by the  California Strong Motion
              Instrumentation Program SMIP) will be  estimated using simplified techniques
              and recorded ground-motion  data, and compared with the recorded structural
              responses.  In  addition, a detailed analysis of the University of Southern 
              California Hospital structure will be carried out.  A three-  dimensional,
              non-linear model of this building with a simplified  soil-structure interaction
              model will be created and used to the  assessment of the predictability of the
              response of base-isolated  structures subjected to moderate ground motions, and
              the effects of  soil-structure interaction in the response of base-isolated 
              structures.      This is a Northridge Earthquake Project.
