Abstract    :
              9416318  Unruh    This study will analyze the aftershocks of the January 17,
              1994  Northridge earthquake to obtain  distributed seismogenic deformation and
              t test existing models of  uplift and folding above blind  thrust faults. 
              Detailed studies of recent blind thrust earthquakes  have shown that
              significant  deformation of the hangingwall of the fault occurs by slip on
              small  faults at a high angle to  bedding, and not just by bedding-plane slip
              as the models imply.   Another possible reason for  departure from the standard
              model is that the thrusts beneath the  Los Angeles and San Fernando  Valleys
              are rooted in crystalline basement rocks, rather than in  sedimentary rocks for
              which the  model was originally developed.  The analysis will use patterns of 
              seismic P and T axes to  obtain seismogenic strain rates and the rotational
              component  (vorticity), which will then be  compared with the model prediction.
               The results will enhance  understanding of deformation  associated with blind
              thrusts, and will be therefore test the  ability of the existing models to 
              predict behavior of the crust during blind thrust earthquakes.
