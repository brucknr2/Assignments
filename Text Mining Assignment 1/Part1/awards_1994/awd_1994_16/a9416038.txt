Abstract    :
                      9416038  Harper  This research is focused on exploring the role of
              Calcium-Dependent  Protein Kinases (CDPKs) in mechano-sensory signal
              transduction.   The three specific aims are to: 1) Identify substrates for
              CDPK-  dependent signal transduction pathway, 2) Test the hypothesis that  the
              activity of CDPK isoform AK1 is critical to a mechano-sensory  response, and 3)
              Develop a fluorescent tagging system to monitor  dynamic changes in the
              membrane/cytoskeletal systems of live cells  in response to physical
              stimulation.  Since many mechano-sensory  responses appear to involve calcium
              signals, it is important to  determine what role CDPKs are playing in these
              phenomena.  Using a  CDPK signal transduction pathway as a focus, this research
               emphasizes the development of unique collaborations and new tools  with far
              reaching implications for research in the field of plant  cell biology.  For
              example, the specific aim to identify CDPK  substrates will involve a
              collaboration of researchers from all  areas of plant biology.  In the second
              specific aim, the transgenic  plants expressing a mutant CDPK will be made
              available as a tool to  all researchers seeking to define the signal
              transduction pathways  involved in a plant's response to an environmental
              signal.   Finally, it is hoped that the tool developed in the third specific 
              aim, GFP tagged membrane/cytoskeletal systems, will provide a  foundation for a
              powerful new approach in investigating the  dynamics of cell structure.  ***
