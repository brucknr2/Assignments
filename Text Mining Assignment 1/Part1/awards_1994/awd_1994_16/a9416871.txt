Abstract    :
              9416871 McCann  Fundamental processing research related to the chemistry and
              physics aspects of fabrication of novel IV-VI semiconductor laser structures
              composed of Pb(1-x)EuxSe(l-y)Tey  and Pb(1-x)SnxSe(l-y)Tey layers lattice
              matched with BaF2 diode lasers will be carried out.  Procedures will be studied
              which involve removing an epitaxially-grown narrow bandgap IV-VI semiconductor
              laser structure from the substrate and then sandwiching the laser structure
              between two thermally conductive heat sinks.  IV-VI semiconductor laser
              structures will be grown using both molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and liquid
              phase epitaxy (LPE). %%%  The primary goal of this program is to develop a
              fundamental understanding of advanced processing of IV-VI semiconductor laser
              materials.  An important feature of the program is the training of students in
              a fundamentally and technologically significant area of materials research. 
              This research will contribute to improving the general performance of advanced
              photonic devices used in monitoring atmospheric constituents.  ***
