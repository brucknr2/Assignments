Abstract    :
              9416480  Soong    Observed nonstructural damage during major earthquakes has
              played  an important role in the investigation of a wide range of  research
              issues dealing with seismic behavior of nonstructural  components.  These
              include the formulation of codes and  provisions for nonstructural components
              which specify safety  levels at which these components must be anchored or
              attached to  a primary structure and the development of seismic design 
              guidelines for their anchorage details and restraints.    The objectives of
              this research project ar to assess the impact  of the Northridge earthquake on
              the following two specific and  interlocking research issues:    (a)  The
              recently recommended 1994 NEHRP provisions for       nonstructural components. 
              The Northridge damage       data provides a unique opportunity for assessing   
                 the values assigned tovarious dynamic-effect factors       contained in the
              force and displacement formulas.    (b)  The performance of a selected group of
              seismic restraints       located in the affected area, some of which were only 
                   recently developed.  The Northridge event provides the       first
              opportunity for evaluating their performance under an       actual code-level
              earthquake.    The results of this research will lead to a better understanding
               of the seismic behavior of nonstructural components under a wide  variety of
              conditions.  In turn, these results will leade to the  development of safer and
              more rational design guidelines for  operating these components in a seismic
              environment.    This is a Northridge earthquake project.    ***
