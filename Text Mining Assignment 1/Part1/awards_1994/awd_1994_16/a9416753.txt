Abstract    :
                                9416753  Chaki  A new technique is proposed for preparing
              metal-matrix composites.   This technique involves impacting ceramic particles
              on a thin and  flowing sheet of liquid metal.  If mixing of the impacted
              particles  with the metal stream can be accomplished, this process is expected 
              to result in a uniform distribution of ceramic particles in a metal  matrix. 
              The liquid metal sheet containing the ceramic particles  will impinge onto a
              spinning disk whereby the liquid sheet breaks  up into small droplets of the
              metal-matrix composite.  These  droplets will solidify rapidly and be collected
              and subsequently  compacted into test samples using hot press sintering and hot
               rolling.  These test samples will be used to evaluate the resulting  structure
              and also the mechanical properties of the metal-matrix  composite.  ***
