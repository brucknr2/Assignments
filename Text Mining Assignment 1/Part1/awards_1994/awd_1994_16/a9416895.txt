Abstract    :
              9416895  Cane  In this project the PIs will study deep water formation in the
              Red  Sea using geochemical and physical techniques.  Geochemical work  will
              involve obtaining high resolution samples corals, from which  measurements of
              stable oxygen isotopes (O-18/O-16 and Sr/Ca) will  be made.  Samples will be
              obtained near the tip of the Sinai  Peninsula, where the temperature is high,
              allowing very rapid coral  growth, but where the PIs hypothesize that strong
              winter convection  produces deep water formation.  Samples of corals near the
              sea  surface will be compared with those at greater depths in the  pycnocline. 
              In this component of the study, the data will be  assimilated in a model of the
              Red Sea which includes deep  convection, in order to test the hypothesis.
