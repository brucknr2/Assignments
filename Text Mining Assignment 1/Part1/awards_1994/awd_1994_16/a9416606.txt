Abstract    :
              9416606  BRULAND    Although chemical and biological oceanographers have known 
              for several decades that the dynamics of many trace  elements, especially the
              bioactive trace metals, and the  population dynamics of the phytoplankton are
              intimately  interrelated, few studies have succeeded in establishing 
              cause-and-effect relationships between them.  In this study,  an
              internationally preeminent marine trace metal geochemist  will address this
              question by studying the interactions  between four trace metals-- iron,
              manganese, copper, and  zinc -- with phytoplankton communities off the coasts
              of  California and British Columbia.  Because these are areas  where deep
              nutrient-and-metal-rich water is upwelled to the  surface, the principal
              investigator will be able to sample  the plankton, the four trace metals (and
              their various  chemical forms, or "species"), along transects extending  from
              the low-productivity oceanic zone far from shore,  across the high-production
              upwelling zone and its environs,  and into the nearshore zone. By studying the
              cruise-track  variations in water chemistry and plankton community  composition
              and productivity, the PI will attempt to  elucidate how phytoplankton
              productivity relates to the  phytoplankton blooms impact trace metal chemistry.
