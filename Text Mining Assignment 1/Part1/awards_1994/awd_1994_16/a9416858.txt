              Abstract  ATM-9416858  Eisner, Wendy R.  Ohio State University  Title: Applied
              Paleoecology: Vegetation History, soil carbon  accumulation and climatic
              interactions of the Peatlands on the  North Slope, Alaska    This award
              supports research under the ARCSS/PALE Program .  A wide  range of
              paleoecological indicators from selected North Slope  peatlands will be
              analyzed in order to reconstruct vegetation  history and the relationship of
              tundra vegetation to carbon  accumulation rates.  Cores and surface samples
              will be taken from  sites currently under investigation within the ARCSS
              Program  initiatives.  Surface samples will be used to calibrate biotic 
              indicators with vegetation type, soil temperature, thaw depth, and  moisture. 
              Pollen, spores, fungi, algae, and macrofossils will be  analyzed as proxy data
              for the past ecosystem. Vegetation  reconstruction will be compared to changing
              carbon accumulation  rates in the cores, offering ecologists and soil
              scientists a very  long-term monitoring device of landscape dynamics in this
              complex  environment.  The arctic tundra plays a significant role as a major 
              repository of the world's carbon.  Northern peat may still be  accumulating
              soil carbon or may actually be losing it.  This  question has important
              consequences for global change scenarios.
