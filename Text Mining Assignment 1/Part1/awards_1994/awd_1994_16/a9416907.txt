Abstract    :
                                                9416907  Ram    This  symposium  focuses on
              the biology  of  zebra  mussels.  Zebra  mussels are recent invaders of North
              American  fresh-  water  ecosystems,  carried here  in  1986  from  Europe  in 
              ballast water of a ship that flushed its ballast tanks  into  Lake  St.  Claire
               near  Detroit, Michigan.   Zebra  mussels  settle  in large numbers on hard
              surfaces and grow  rapidly,  so  that  they often coat underwater structures
              and displace  native  freshwater mussels.  Zebra mussels have  received  a 
              great deal of attention because of their economic impact  as  fouling 
              organisms,  but  very  little  research  has   been  directed  toward
              understanding of their basic biology.   The  symposium  gathers  scientists  to
               summarize  and   discuss  current research into the biology, ecology and
              physiology of  zebra  mussels.   The participants include  two  female  and 
              eight  male  scientists who study zebra mussels, drawn  from  both   academic  
              and   management   organizations,      The  proceedings  of  the  symposium
              will  be  published  in  the  American  Zoologist, a major research journal.  
              The  result  will be a relatively complete and accessible summary of  the 
              basic  biology  of  a  species that is an  economically  and  ecologically 
              important invader into North American  streams  and lakes.
