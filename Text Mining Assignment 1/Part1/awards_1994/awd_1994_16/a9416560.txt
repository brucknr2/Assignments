Abstract    :
              9416560  JONES         Carbon monoxide is an important component in the cycling
              of  carbon and nitrogen in the world oceans.  Photochemical and 
              microbiological studies have shown that CO is mainly produced by  the oxidation
              of natural dissolved organic matter.  At present,  however, little is known
              about the major molecular components  responsible for the photochemical
              production of CO, the main  environmental factors which affect the CO formation
              and  consumption, and the role of microorganisms in the regeneration of 
              organic source of CO in the ocean.  As a continuation of past  research this
              effort will further study the basic mechanisms for  the photochemical and
              microbial cycling of CO in marine and fresh  water systems.  The main
              objectives of this research are to:  (1)  identify possible molecular
              components for the photochemical  production of CO with basic photochemical
              theory and available  information about the identified components of natural
              dissolved  organic matter and possible structures of parent humic substances, 
              (2) examine the influences of dissolved oxygen, transition metals  and low
              molecular weight organic compounds which do not appre-  ciably absorb sunlight
              at sea surface on the formation and con-  sumption of CO, and (3) examine the
              role of microorganisms in the  transformation of aquatic humic substances
              including in the photo-  production of CO.
