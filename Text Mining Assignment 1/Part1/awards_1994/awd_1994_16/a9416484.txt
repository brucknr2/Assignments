Abstract    :
              9416484  Haroun  The Northridge earthquake induced a number of incidents of
              damage  to ground-based tanks, and even to some retrofitted tanks.  Utilities
              and industrial facilities in the strong shaking area  include a large inventory
              of tanks of all types, and many records  have been obtained in the vicinity of
              damaged and undamaged  tanks.  The mass of data on earthquake ground motions
              and  observations of the structural response have important  implications for
              the earthquake resistant design.  This is  project will study the performance
              of tank structures as follows:      Collection of data and documentation of the
              damaged sustained    by ground-based water and petroleum storage tanks.     
              Calculation of the dynamic response of representative tanks    and correlation
              of the computed response with observed damage    or lack of damage.      Study
              of the effects of long period components on the sloshing    phenomenon.     
              Study of the damage to retrofitted tanks to deduce the reasons    for the
              ineffectiveness of implemented to retrofit mechanisms.    Specifically, a study
              of damage to the anchors is proposed to    devise improved ways for the
              anchoring system.      Comparison of induced seismic forces with those
              specified by    available codes and standards such as API 650, AWWA 100, EPRI, 
                UBC and the New Zealand Recommendations.    New advances have been made in
              the analysis of liquid-filled  tanks such as non-linear sloshing of liquids,
              elephant foot  buckling of the tank shell, and combined liquid-structure-soil 
              interaction.  This is an opportune time to compare the predicted  response with
              actual behavior under earthquake loading to refine  and tune these methods and
              to provide improved seismic design  procedures.    This is a Northridge
              Earthquake project.  ***
