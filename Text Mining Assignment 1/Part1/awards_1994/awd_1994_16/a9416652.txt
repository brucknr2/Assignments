Abstract    :
              9416652  Feher  Various electron transfer steps in native and mutant reaction 
              centers will be investigated.  Two electron transfer steps will     be
              addressed in detail: 1) the electron transfer rate from the  primary quinone,
              QA to the secondary quinone, QB and ii) the charge  recombination of QA and QB
              with the primary donor D+. The second  problem deals with the protonation of
              the doubly reduced quinone.  Q2- is buried inside the reaction center and is
              not accessible to  protons from the outside.  It is now generally believed that
               protons reach Q2- by a charge-relay mechanism involving protonatable 
              residues.  The problem is to identify the residues that constitute  the proton
              transfer chain.  This problem will be addressed by site-  directed mutagenesis.
               Three residues  Glu (L212), Arg (L213) and  Ser (L223)  have already been
              identified as being members of the  proton transfer chain.  In addition, the
              mechanism of proton  transfer will be addressed by studying the coupling
              between  electron and proton transfer and the role of electrostatics in the 
              transfer.  Theoretical calculations will be performed to  complement, guide and
              explain the experimental results.  %%%  The goal of the research is to
              contribute toward an understanding  of the primary processes in photosynthesis,
              i.e., the mechanism of  conversion of electromagnetic energy into chemical free
              energy.   The research will focus on the photosynthetic processes in purple 
              bacteria (e.g. Rhodobacter sphaeroides).  The findings will be of  general
              interest and applicability to other biological systems and  mechanisms,
              foremost to green plant photosynthesis and to other  bioenergetic processes. 
              The primary process of photosynthesis  takes place in an integral membrane
              protein-pigment complex called  the reaction center.  Light produces a charge
              separation and  initiates a set of electron transfer reactions resulting in the
               reduction of a terminal acceptor, which picks up two protons, and  initiates
              the formation of the proton gradi ent that provides the  driving force for the
              formation of high energy compounds.  Thus,  the main questions associated with
              the primary processes are  associated with electron and proton transfers.
