Abstract    :
              9416342  Zhang    This research is to determine source parameters of the
              Northridge  earthquake that can be best resolved with broadband and long-period
               regional and teleseismic recordings.  Parameters include total  seismic
              moment, total rupture duration and the overall source  geometry.  Techniques to
              be used include complete waveform  inversion of body wave and surface wave
              signals using an aspherical  earth model with a centroid-moment tensor
              inversion approach;  spectral inversion of fundamental mode surface waves with 
              propagation corrections for an aspherical model; body and surface  wave
              deconvolutions using empirical and theoretical Green's  functions; and a
              combined broadband body waveform/surface wave  spectra inversion for extracting
              a very broadband source model.   The analysis will provide characterization of
              the long-period far-  field source radiation, yielding basic constraints on the
              energy  release, duration, and geometry of the faulting, which must be 
              satisfied by more detailed models striving to match observed near-  field
              motion.  This project is a contribution to the National  Earthquake Hazard
              Reduction Program and is supported by the  Northridge Earthquake Emergency
              Appropriation.  ***
