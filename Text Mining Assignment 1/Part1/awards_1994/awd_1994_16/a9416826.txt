Abstract    :
                            9416826  Baier        The Industry/University Cooperative Research
              Center for Biosurfaces  is becoming a multi-site university Center.  The State
              University  of New York at Buffalo's Industry/University Cooperative Research 
              Center for Biosurfaces is being joined by a research site at the  University of
              Memphis and another research site at the New York  State College of Ceramics.  
                 Research in the multi-site Center will address:  1)  Characterization of the
              chemical/physical properties of various  substrata that favor or inhibit
              bioadhesion, in aqueous media of  varied organic/inorganic content; 2)
              Determination of the surface  properties of cells as they engage in
              interactions with well-  characterized substrata, giving special attention to
              the dynamics  of media flow, cell arrival, surface modification, bio-attachment
               and -- finally -- stability of the attachment mechanisms; 3)  Documentation of
              reactions between cells and supporting films,  cells and adjacent cells, films
              and surrounding media, and other  cross-reactions, with particular attention to
              technology that may  control these interactions to either promote or prevent
              bioadhesion  in practical biomedical or bioengineering situations; and 4)
              Scale-  up of these biotechnologies to macrosystem processes, like adhesive 
              secretion or biomineralization, that may produce new, or mimic  existing,
              materials such as structural composite shells and  adhesives of natural
              organisms.    This multi-site Center has been coordinated with Dr. Norman
              Caplan,  Program Director, Environmental Systems Program.    The State
              University of New York has requested funding to support  undergraduate research
              assistants.  These students will participate  in the Center's ongoing research
              projects.    Additional funding is provided through a supplemental Research 
              Opportunity Award (ROA) for a woman Assistant Professor at  D'Youville College
              to perform research for the State University of  New - Buffalo.                
                                        Pa ge 1 of 2            The Project is determining
              the protein structure associated with  bioadhesives functionality.  The
              project's goal is to study the  protein structures responsible for the binding
              ability of selected  native adhesive protein domains and for their use in the 
              development of manufactured proteinaceous adhesive agents.  The Program Manager
              recommends the State University of New York at  Buffalo be awarded:  $50,000
              for the first year of a five-year  continuing award (including $25,000 for
              administrative activities);  $50,000 for the first year of a five-year
              continuing award to the  University of Memphis through a subcontract; $50,000
              for the first  year of a five-year continuing award to the New York State
              College  of Ceramics through a subcontract; $5,000 for one year with  funds
              provided by the Women, Minorities, and Disabled Engineering  Research
              Assistants Program; and $54,995 for 24 months for a  Research Opportunity
              award.    Near the end of each 12-month period the Program Manager and/or the 
              Division Director of the Engineering Education Centers Division  will review
              the progress of the Center on a number of renewal  criteria requirements,
              including the following:  1) the extent to  which the industry/university
              interaction is developing; 2) the  extent to which support base is developing;
              and 3) the extent to  which a robust research program is developing.  If the
              review is  satisfactory, the Program Manager will recommend support for the 
              next period of this continuing award.
