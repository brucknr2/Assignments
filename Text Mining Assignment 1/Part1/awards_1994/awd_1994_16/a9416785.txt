Abstract    :
              9416785  Irwin         This award to the Committee on the Status of Women
              (CRAW), provides for travel support for committee meetings, for continuing
              projects, and for new projects.  CRAW, a committee of the Computing Research
              Association (CRA), was established in 1990.  The goal of the Committee is to
              take positive action to increase the number of women participating in computer
              science and engineering research and education at all levels.  Dr. Mary Jane
              Irwin, a Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at Pennsylvania State
              University, and Dr. Fran Berman, an Associate Professor of Computer Science at
              the University of California, San Diego are co-chairs of CRAW.    CRAW has been
              very active in recommending and organizing projects and in many cases obtaining
              separate funding for them.  Members of CRAW have produced several articles on
              women's issues in CS for the Computing Research News; have started the
              Systers-Academia, a moderated electronic mailing list for female faculty and
              Ph.D. students in CS&E; have established the Ph.D. database of women with
              Ph.D's in CS&E; and have presented career management workshops at major
              conferences and events (with additional funding).    The CRA is an association
              of U.S. and Canadian academic departments of Computer Science and Computer
              Engineering, and Industrial Laboratories engaging in basic computing research. 
              The mission of CRA is to represent and inform the computing research community
              and to support and promote its interests.  ***
