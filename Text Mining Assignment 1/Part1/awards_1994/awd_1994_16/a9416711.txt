Abstract    :
              9416711  Chen    Data collected in 1993 on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge north of the 
              Bouvet triple junction will be used to study the factors  contributing to the
              disappearance of the axial valley and the  interaction of the ridge with the
              proposed Shona hotspot.  The  objectives are to determine the tectonic history
              of the ridge  segment, explain the variation in axial morphology, produce a 
              Bouguer anomaly map, and integrate the geophysical data with  geochemical
              results to better understand the influence of the  proposed Shona hotspot on
              the ridge.
