Abstract    :
              9416552  Kutzko    This Americas Program award will support a collaboration 
              between Dr. Philip Kutzko, University of Iowa, and Dr. Jorge  Soto Andrade,
              Universidad de Chile, on the local aspects of  the Langlands program.  The
              researchers will explore the  connection, via compact induction, between theta 
              correspondences for groups over finite fields and theta  correspondences for
              groups over local fields to try to  determine to what extent these
              correspondences are  functorial in the sense of Langlands.  Determination of
              such  functoriality is of substantial number-theoretic interest.    The
              proposed work is likely to lead to a detailed analysis  of the local aspects of
              the Langlands program, which  experience has shown is necessary for a real
              breakthrough in  this area.  In addition, by working with the different  groups
              in Chile, the collaboration will broaden and  strengthen joint work in an
              important mathematical area.  ***
