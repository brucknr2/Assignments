Abstract    :
              9416194  Nicholson    This study will acquire deep crustal seismic data,
              originally obtained using dynamite in the  1940's and 1950's, from the Ventura
              Basin, San Fernando Valley, and Los Angeles Basin.   Modern deep crustal
              seismic data across these areas would be almost impossible to collect today 
              due to prohibitive costs and local governmental regulations.  The existing
              seismic data set, once  acquired, will be stored at the Southern California
              Earthquake Center.  The data will be analyzed  and interpreted using well data
              and seismicity to help resolve the seismic behavior, subsurface  geometry, and
              seismic potentia of active faults in the Ventura Basin and San Fernando Valley.
                The data will be integrated into a three-dimensional image of subsurface
              basin geometry and  fault structure, and then compared with existing
              two-dimensional models from balanced,  retrodeformable cross-sections.  The
              results will help provide a basis for understanding the  geometry, tectonic
              development and seismic hazard potential along strike of major fold and faults 
              systems in the Ventura Basin and San Fernando Valley areas.
