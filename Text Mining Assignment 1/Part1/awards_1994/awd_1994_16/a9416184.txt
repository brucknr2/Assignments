Abstract    :
              9416184  Goel  The primary objective of this research project is to develop 
              methods for evaluation and upgrading of existing "non-  ductile" (ordinary)
              concentric braced frame structures of  steel for survival during future
              earthquakes.    Whereas, widespread connection failures in steel moment  frames
              due to the Northridge earthquake were quite  unexpected, it is also generally
              recognized that concentric  braced frames (CBF) are among the most efficient
              and popular  structural systems in steel for lateral load resistance.  There
              exists a large inventory of these structures which are  potentially hazardous. 
              A significant number of such  structures suffered widespread damage during the
              Northridge  earthquake and required extensive repair and upgrading work. 
              Current or past design practice and codes did not focus on  providing ductility
              in these structures previously studied.    The Northridge experience has
              emphasized the need for  developing methods for evaluating and upgrading
              existing CBF  in order to ensure satisfactory performance during future  more
              severe probable earthquakes.    Two theme structures are selected for the
              study.  The four  story building in North Hollywood which suffered the most 
              dramatic failures and which represents the typical CBF  structures designed by
              modern codes and practice has been  chosen for detailed investigation including
              correlation of  the results with observed damage.  The second part of this 
              project is devoted to the development of practical and  effective upgrading
              schemes to mitigate future earthquake  hazard.    This is a Northridge
              earthquake project.  ***
