Abstract    :
              This research program will investigate the generation mechanisms of small scale
              (1 to 10 km) irregularities in the  high latitude ionosphere.  The focus of the
              research will be to develop an analytical and numerical three-dimensional 
              model of one of the main structuring mechanisms in the high latitude
              ionosphere, referred to as the E cross B  instability.  The methods to be
              employed will include both analytical and numerical three-dimensional models. 
              The  models proposed in the past have been unable to explain many
              characteristic features of the small scale structure.   The previous
              two-dimensional simulations of the instability indicate development of large
              scale structures that disrupt  the gradients driving the instability.  However,
              three dimensional treatments indicate long scale length stabilization  for
              these modes due to parallel dynamics.  The analytical and numerical results for
              the small scale irregularity  generation and their impact on the long scale
              processes will be compared with observations, and new experiments  will be
              suggested to test the theoretical results.
