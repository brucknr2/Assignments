              Abstract  ATM-9416954  Chen, Tsing-Chang  Iowa State University  Title:
              Season-to-Interdecadal Climate Variability    Several interesting problems
              concerning the climate variability of  the atmospheric circulation with
              seasonal to decadal time scales  emerged from our prior research project.  In
              order to seek answers  to these problems, the PI proposes the following
              research thrusts:         a) the three-dimensional structure and maintenance
              mechanism       of summertime stationary eddies and their interannual      
              variation component; and         b) the basic structure and time evolution of
              the interdecadal       variation mode of the wintertime atmospheric circulation
              over       the past five decades (1946-1994), and the possible mechanism      
              inducing this interdecadal variation.    The mechanisms responsible for the
              interannual variation of  summertime stationary eddies and interdecadal
              variation of  wintertime circulation, as suggested from diagnostic analyses,
              will  be tested with the NCAR Community Climate Model, and the  corresponding
              linearized version.  Several data sources, including  the OLR, COADS, NMC and
              ECMWF GDAS (1979-1994), NMC octagonal-grid  (1946-1993) and 35-year reanalyzed
              NMC GDAS (1958-1993) data, will  be used in the proposed research thrusts. 
              Funds and time allowing,  some further work will be done on seasonal and
              interannual  variations of global relative atmospheric angular momentum, and
              the  roles played by these variations in low-frequency climate  variability.   
              This research is important because it seeks to enhance knowledge  about climate
              processes on seasonal-to-interdecadal time scales.
