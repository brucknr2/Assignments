Abstract    :
              9416771  Anderson  The research under this project will focus on experimental 
              and analytical evaluation of two design modifications which  have been
              suggested for welded beam to column connections.  These modifications are
              intended for both the repair of  connections which were damaged during the
              Northridge  earthquake and for the strengthening of welded connections  in new
              construction.    Large scale beam-column components which are representative 
              of damages during the earthquake will be considered.  Cyclic  testing of eight
              specimens having beam to column connections  which are reinforced using
              variations of two different  schemes will be carried out.  The initial scheme
              will  consider the addition of reinforcing plates to the bottom  and/or top
              flange.  The second will add a knee bracket plate  (structural tee) to the
              bottom flange of the beam along with  associated stiffener plates in the
              column.    Parallel finite-element analytical studies of the  distribution of
              stresses and strains in the joint region  will be conducted.  The nonlinear
              behavior of the connection  model will be evaluated under equivalent static
              monotonic  loading.  These results will be calibrated against the  experimental
              results.    These studies will suggest repair procedures or design 
              modifications for new construction to supply the moment and  rotation capacity
              demanded by the earthquake ground motion.  Recommendations for modifying the
              connection details so as  to strengthen the connection region and avoid these
              types of  failures will be presented.    This is a Northridge Earthquake
              project.  ***
