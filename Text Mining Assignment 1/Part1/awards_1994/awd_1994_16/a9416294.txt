Abstract    :
              9416294  Hobbie    The LMER research program seeks to investigate and 
              understand the changes that are occurring in coastal  environments due to human
              population growth, land use  changes and global climate change. To comprehend
              the many  factors involved, it is necessary to conduct research on a 
              multidisciplinary, comprehensive and coordinated level.  Accordingly, the LMER
              sites have met regularly, through  funding from NSF  to facilitate the
              cooperation needed to  solve common problems, compare results, focus on shared 
              goals and coordinate research with various coastal ecosystem  programs.    The
              LMER Coordinating  Committee and  the Coordination  Office have developed an
              awareness of  the LMER  program  within the scientific community as well as
              facilitated  opportunities for cooperative research, coordinated LMER 
              activities with other federal agencies, and created ties to  international
              coastal research efforts. The Coordination  Office has greatly increased
              communication among the  projects and facilitated the organization of special
              focus  scientific meetings.    This project will provide support  for the
              continued  operation of the LMER Coordination Office at the Marine  Biological
              Laboratory in Woods Hole, support  the activities  of the LMER Coordinating
              Committee and  organize regular  meetings of  the LMER scientists and others to
              provide a  comprehensive and integrated approach to the  study of these 
              environmentally important ecosystems.
