Abstract    :
                This three-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative research in
              chemical engineering and catalysis.  The investigators are Supramaniam
              Srinivasan, A. John Appleby of Texas A & M University,  James McBreen of the
              Brookhaven National Laboratory, and Claude Lamy of the University of Poitiers
              in France.  The objectives of their research are to develop new alloy or mixed
              metal electrocatalysts for oxidation of methanol in proton exchange membrane
              fuel cells.  They will develop binary and ternary alloys of platinum using
              ruthenium, tin and molybdenum as alloying elements.  Proton exchange membrane
              fuel cells are among the most promising types of fuel cell  power sources for
              electric vehicles.  These studies are expected to pave the way for the
              development of direct, high powered, and efficient methanol fuel cells for
              application in methanol powered electric vehicles.  The U.S. investigators
              bring to this collaboration considerable experience in electrochemistry,
              electrocatalysis and proton exchange membrane fuel cells.  This is complemented
              by the French investigator's expertise in electrocatalysis and 
              characterization of fuel cells using spectroscopic studies.  The project takes
              advantage of specialized electrochemical and spectroscopic instrumentation
              available at the University of Poitiers.
