Abstract    :
              This proposal addresses coupling between the ionosphere and lower  thermosphere
              which leads to large scale structure in the lower  thermosphere at high
              latitudes.  The PI has successfully  investigated the morphology of cell
              structures using the TIGCM, and  confirmed their existence using two
              independent satellite data  sets.  This proposal is very relevant to
              understanding the lower  thermosphere.  As the coupling between the upper and
              lower  atmosphere comes into focus over the next few years, it will be 
              increasingly important to understand what causes the observed  behavior of the
              lower thermosphere, and to be able to separate the  effects of high latitude
              forcing from those due to upward  propagating tides and gravity waves, for
              example.  The work,  therefore, will represent a vital contribution to the
              study of the  lower thermosphere - the least understood region of the
              atmosphere.
