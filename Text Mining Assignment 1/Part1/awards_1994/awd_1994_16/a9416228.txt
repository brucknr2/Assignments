Abstract    :
              9416228  Alesch  This  project is being funded as part of the National 
              Earthquake  Hazards  Reduction Program's investigation into  the  causes  and 
              effects of the January 17, 1994 earthquake.  The purpose  of  the  research  is
               to:  learn  the  extent  to  which  the  earthquake  contributed  to small
              business failures; identify the  extent  to  which   structural   mitigation, 
              insurance,  noninsurance   risk  management  techniques,  and disaster
              assistance  contributed  to  small  business survival and recovery; field test 
              a  theoretical  model  that estimates the probable financial effects of 
              damaging  earthquakes  on small businesses based on business  and  industry 
              characteristics;  and  provide  a  basis  for   furthering   risk  management 
              strategies  for  small  businesses.   Data  will   be  collected  through
              telephone and face-to-face interviews  with  a  stratified, random sample of
              small business owners and  operators  in the Los Angeles area.  ***
