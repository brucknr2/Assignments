Abstract    :
              9416321  Wells    The Puente Hills, in the eastern Los Angeles Basin, are the
              surface expression of the Santa  Monica Mountains - Elysian Park anticlinorium
              which is forming the response to movement on  blind thrust ramps.  This study
              will address the likelihood of the entire fault rupturing  simultaneously, in
              one very large earthquake event, or in several smaller events of Northridge- 
              type, or in numerous small events of Whittier-Narrows-type.  By analysis of
              Quaternary  sediments in three meandering rivers that cross the structure and
              that contain alternating coarse  sand and organic-rich beds, it will be
              possible to determine and compare the timing of past  deformation events on the
              Puente Hills thrust ramp.  The research will involve analyses at two  distinct
              scales using oil and water well logs and fluvial and marine terrace deposits,
              and high-  precision radiocarbon dating and logging of boreholes excavated
              specifically for this project.   The results will provide constraints on the
              timing and magnitude of past earthquakes connected  with the Santa Monica
              Mountains - Elysian Park anticlinorium.
