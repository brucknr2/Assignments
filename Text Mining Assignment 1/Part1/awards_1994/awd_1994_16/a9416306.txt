Abstract    :
              9416306  Kenig       This award provides funding for group travel of junior 
              investigators and graduate students to participate in a research  program at
              the International Centre for Mathematical Sciences in  Edinburgh, Scotland. 
              The research focus is at the interface of  harmonic analysis and partial
              differential equations.   A number  of outstanding mathematical scientists will
              be in residence  during the program working informally with the visitors and 
              conducting seminars on various topics.  These include such areas  as harmonic
              analysis related to curvature and  oscillatory integrals, well-posedness and
              local smoothing effects  in nonlinear hyperbolic and dispersive partial 
              differential equations.  The program will capitalize on  applications of
              previously developed ideas while fostering growth  in what is the most
              promising new directions in harmonic analysis  and differential equations. 
              Many leading experts from the U.S.  and U.K. will participate in this activity,
              which is also  receiving financial support from the SERC (of Great Britain).
