Abstract    :
              9416210  Stuart Thompson    Calcium  ions hold a central position in the
              hierarchy of  events  that  regulate  both  the metabolism and  the  unique 
              functional  attributes of neurons in the nervous system. A delicate interplay 
              exits  between  the entry of calcium into the cells  through  ion  channels  in
               the  membrane and the removal of calcium  from  the  cells  by  ion pumps.
              When this balance is disturbed  for  longer  than a few minutes, the result is
              nerve cell death. Consequently,  there  is  great  interest  among 
              researchers,  clinicians   and  pharmaceutical manufacturers in understanding
              the mechanisms that  control  calcium  levels in neurons. This conference  will
               bring  together  researchers,  educators,  graduate  students  and  drug 
              company  representatives to discuss the latest findings  in  this  research 
              area. The focus is on a neuly discovered  pathway  that  directly  links the
              metabolic state of the neuron to the  control  of  the calcium entry pathway.
              This pathway is changing our  view  of  metabolic regulation and neuronal
              function. This meeting will  bring  together the key persons involved in this
              research  around  the world.
