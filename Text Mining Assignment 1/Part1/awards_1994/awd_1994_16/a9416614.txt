Abstract    :
              9416614  Ammerman           The principal objective of this study is to 
              determine if planktonic microbial growth in the Sargasso Sea  is phosphorus
              limited.  This objective will be addressed by  a combination of chemical,
              metabolic and biomass  measurements coupled with a series of
              nutrient-enrichment  experiments.  The measurements will made over the course
              of  three cruises aimed at capturing contrasting spring bloom  and summer
              periods.  More frequent time series cruises will  supplement the results fro
              these three proposed study will  measure the cycling of phosphorus in the
              Sargasso Sea, which  is a major but rarely studied nutrient which may be
              limiting  autotrophic and heterotrophic planktonic growth.  Phosphorus 
              limitation in such environments could have significant  impact on the global
              phosphorus cycle and the oceanic  component of the global carbon cycle.  The
              research will  also serve to improve analytical methods for measuring 
              inorganic phosphorus in seawater.
