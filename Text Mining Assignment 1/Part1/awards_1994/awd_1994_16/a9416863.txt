Abstract    :
              9416863  Lohmann       This study will analyze the radiocarbon in shells of 
              foraminifera in sediments from Little Bahama Bank, in order to  determine
              whether it is feasible to use this kind of data to  study changes in
              upper-ocean circulation under past climate  states.  Two competing hypotheses
              on what controls radiocarbon  differences in sediment components also will be
              tested.  ***
