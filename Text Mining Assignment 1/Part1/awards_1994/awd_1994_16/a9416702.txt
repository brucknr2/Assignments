Abstract    :
              CTS-9416702  Davis  Univ. of Colorado      Research will focus on understanding
              of the role of hydrodynamic interactions in the microflotation process. 
              Microflotation involves the capture of very small suspended particles from
              liquids by rising microscopic bubbles.  Theoretical work will be conducted to
              determine the effects of Brownian motion, solid particle size and shape, and
              also bubble deformation on the rate of particle capture.  Some experiments will
              be performed to test the validity of the models.  The research may improve the
              ability to design more efficient separation of particles by microflotation
              technique for various environmental, mining and manufacturing applications.
