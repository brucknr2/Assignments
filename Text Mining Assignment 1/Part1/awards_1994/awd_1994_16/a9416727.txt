Abstract    :
              9416727  Golbeck    This award supports the participation of ten  U.S.
              scientists in a U.S.-Japan Seminar on  Dynamic Aspects of Photochemical
              Reaction  Centers, to be held in Tokyo in January 1995.   The seminar is part
              of the U.S.-Japan  Photosynthesis/Photoconversion Program.  The  U.S. organizer
              is Professor John Golbeck,  Department of Biochemistry, University of 
              Nebraska, and the Japanese co-organizer is  Professor Tetsuo Hiyama, Department
              of  Biochemistry, Saitama University, Saitama,  Japan.    The agenda for the
              meeting is divided into  three parts:  Generation of Reducing Power:  Dynamic
              Aspects of Photosystem I; Generation of  Oxidizing Power: Aspects of
              Photosystem II  Structure and Function; and Dynamic Aspects of  Photosystem II:
              Oxygen Evolution.  Participants  from both countries are from universities, 
              national research labs, and industrial research  labs.  The purpose of the
              meeting is to  generate interest among in further  collaborative work in
              molecular biology,  biochemistry, and biophysics of the higher  plant
              photosynthetic reaction centers in both  countries.  ***
