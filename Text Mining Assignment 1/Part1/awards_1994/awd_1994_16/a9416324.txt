Abstract    :
              9416324  Levi    This study will examine the paleomagnetism of
              continentally-derived, late Quaternary, Saugus  Formation sedimentary rocks in
              the San Fernando Valley and east Ventura Basin in order to  delineate the
              boundaries of rotated crustal blocks.  Preliminary work has roughly delineated
              the  boundaries of rotated versus non-rotated blocks in the area, and has shown
              that crustal  segmentation and vertical axis rotations continue to the present.
               This work will define the block  boundaries more precisely and relate them to
              mapped faults or other tectonic features.  The  results will enable more
              precise determination of the strike-slip versus dip-slip components of 
              movement in response to the tectonic stresses and may provide a practical limit
              on thrust-fault  earthquake magnitudes in the Los Angeles Basin area.
