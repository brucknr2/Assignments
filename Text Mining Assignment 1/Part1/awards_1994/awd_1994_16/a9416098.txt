Abstract    :
              9416098  McCreary  In this project, the PIs will apply modeling techniques to
              some new  ideas about generation mechanisms for Tropical Instability Waves 
              (TIW), which are dramatic oscillations seen from satellites in the  sea surface
              temperature (SST) front in the near-equatorial zones of  both the Pacific and
              Atlantic Oceans.  They are responsible for  significant equatorward heat fluxes
              which counteract a large  fractioin of kthe cooling due to equatorial
              upwelling.  The focus  of this study will be the effects of the critical
              surface (where  the wave phase speed equals the mean flow speed) and the SST
              fronts  on the stability of the TIW.  Recent data obtained in the Tropical 
              Instability Wave Experiment (TIWE) will be used to compare model  results with
              the observed behavior of the waves.  ***
