Abstract    :
              9416906  Girvin  The main objective of this project is to enhance the
              understanding  of electronic phenomena in condensed matter systems.  The
              proposed  work will include investigations of the quantum and statistical 
              mechanics of various quantum phases of matter including, electronic  Fermi
              liquids, integer and fractional quantum Hall systems,  mesoscopic devices,
              superfluid films and fractal structures, and  both high-temperature and
              conventional superconductors.  Interest  is in how the properties of materials
              can be modified by the  presence of disorder or by the imposition of artificial
              structures,  and by the application of high magnetic fields.  Analytical
              methods  of quantum field theory and many-body theory, as well as numerical 
              quantum Monte Carlo techniques will be applied to the study of  these
              phenomena.  %%%  The objective of this project is to enhance the understanding
              of  the properties of electrons in various materials such as metals and 
              semiconductors.  The proposed work will include investigations of  metals in
              the superconducting state and investigations of ultra-  small eletronic devices
              in which quantum mechanics plays an  important role.  Interest is in how the
              properties of materials can  be modified by the presence of disorder or by the
              imposition of  artificial structures, and by the application of both analytical
               mathematical methods and numerical computational techniques which  have proved
              valuable in this field of science.
