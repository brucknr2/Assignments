Abstract    :
              9416144  Wenger  This  project is being funded as part of the National 
              Earthquake  Hazards  Reduction Program's investigation into  the  causes  and 
              effects of the January 17, 1994 Northridge earthquake.  The study  involves  an
               intensive and comparative analysis of  patterns  of  destruction,  casualties,
               formal  organizational  and  volunteer  search  and  rescue  activities, and
              the provision  of  emergency  medical  services  during the earthquake.  This
              interdisciplinary  project,  involving the disciplines of engineering and
              sociology,  will  use a variety of data gathering techniques, including field 
              observation, intensive interviewing, and analysis of documents.  ***
