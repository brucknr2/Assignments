Abstract    :
              9416774  Henyey    This study will make use of the presence of the
              Lamont-Doherty Research Vessel Maurice  Ewing when it is in southern California
              waters in fall 1994 to acquire a refraction/wide angle  reflection
              onshore-offshore transect through the Northridge epicenter.  The ship will be
              in  southern California waters as part of the Los Angeles Region Seismic
              Experiment already funded  by the NSF, SCEC and USGS.  The 10,000 in tuned air
              gun array on the R/V Ewing will be  used to add a north-south transect over the
              Transverse Ranges fold and thrust belt form Santa  Monica Bay to the western
              Mojave Desert through the Northridge epicentral region.  The results  of this
              study will be combined with reprocessed industry seismic reflection data from
              the San  Fernando Valley to provide information on the subsurface structure of
              the Santa Monica  Mountain-Elysian Park thrust ramp and the Northridge
              earthquake fault system as will as the San  Fernando Basin and its underlying
              crust.
