Abstract    :
              9416970  DeHaemer  This award implements a plan for the Japanese Technology 
              Evaluation Center and the World Technology Evaluation Center  (JTEC/WTEC) to
              conduct twelve studies of foreign R&D to  establish benchmarks to help focus
              U.S. R&D.  The research  will be done by expert panels that will visit foreign 
              laboratories, and present their findings in workshops and in  technical
              reports.  Three methods will be used as  appropriate, (1) the standard approach
              that JTEC/WTEC has  used in previous grants, and two new methods that will 
              provide greater flexibility:  (2) mission-directed studies  on behalf of
              government agencies that must satisfy a limited  set of objectives and meet a
              short time constraint, and (3)  state-of-the art reviews with subjects and
              delegations  proposed by the scientific community.
