Abstract    :
              9416844  TEBO    Because most of the nonliving organic matter in the ocean is
              the  decay-resistant residuum of reworked precursor material, is less  readily
              available for heterotrophic utilization. In deep waters  where sunlight cannot
              provide energy to promote further  degradation, other sources of energy must be
              tapped by decomposer  bacteria in order to utilize this large organic pool. In
              this  study, the principal investigator will conduct laboratory  investigations
              into the capacity of certain marine bacteria to  promote the decomposition of
              this recalcitrant organic matter by  utilizing the oxidizing power released in
              the oxidation-reduction  cycle of manganese. The investigator hypothesizes that
              bacteria  capable of catalyzing the oxidation of Mn might be able to cause  the
              release of simpler organic moieties from the refractory  material and that
              these simpler organic substances could be  utilized as nutrients.  Through
              laboratory culture experimentation,  the growth efficiency of Mn-oxidizing
              bacteria and the yield of  metabolizable organic moieties will be studied using
              bacterial  cultures and natural organic matter from several sources. Depending 
              upon the outcome of these laboratory studies, the investigator may  then be in
              a position to carry similar studies into the field at  some future date in
              order to assess the quantitative importance of  Mn-oxidizing bacteria in marine
              bacterial production and in the  broader biogeochemical context of marine and
              global organic carbon  mineralization.
