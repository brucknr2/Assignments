Abstract    :
              9416933  Gehrels       One of the fundamental questions in Cordilleran tectonics
              is  the degree of orogen-parallel transport of outboard terranes before  final
              docking and amalgmations to North America.   Paleomagnetic  data has commonly
              been used to determine latitude shifts of  allochthouous terranes, but the
              method has many possible sources of  error.  As a result, geologic data is
              frequently at adds with  paleomagnetic interpretations.  This project intends
              to employ an  entirety different technique to detect and quantify
              orogen-parallel  terrane translation.  Prior work has assembled a database of
              the  distribution of zircons in source rocks along the western north  american
              craton.  This project will examine suites of detrital  zircons from outboard
              terranes and match their age distributions to  the North American craton
              database to estimate the degree of  allochthoniety.  Successful results will
              provide an independent  test for possible northward translation of several
              exotic terranes  in western Nevada and northern California, thereby helping to 
              resolve the discrepancy between paleomagnetic results and geology  analysis.
