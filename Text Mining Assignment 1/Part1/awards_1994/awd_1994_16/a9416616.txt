Abstract    :
              9416616  Kelemen       This project plans to investigate the mechanisms of melt 
              extraction from the mantle and the emplacement of magmas in the  lower crust. 
              This will be done by field mapping in the Oman  ophiolate and collection of
              samples there, followed by laboratory  analysis of samples by electron
              microprobe and ion probe.  This  work is important because in the past few
              years there has been a  major change in how we think that magmas are
              transported from the  mantle to magma chambers, and in our perception of the
              size and  shape of magma chambers at mid-ocean ridges.  It is time to  evaluate
              these new ideas by looking for evidence in one of the  best exposed and best
              preserved sections of ocean crust-Oman  ophiolite.  ***
