Abstract    :
              9416248  Elgamal  Earthquake acceleration histories were recorded on and around 
              eight well instrumented earth dams within a 50 mile radius of the  1994
              Northridge earthquake epicenter.  These dams were also  subjected to strong
              ground shaking during the 1971 San Fernando,  and the 1987 Whittier
              earthquakes.  A large data set of valuable  input and response acceleration
              histories is currently available  (Northridge, Whittier, and San Fernando
              earthquakes) for  calibration and verification of simplified as well as
              elaborate  computational analysis procedures.    Past analyses of the San
              Fernando and Whittier recorded  accelerations have significantly contributed to
              our understanding  of earth dam seismic response mechanisms; contributions
              which  were possible only through analyses of actual full-scale seismic 
              response.  The recently recovered Northridge acceleration  histories offer a
              unique opportunity to build on the results of  thorough studies conducted
              earlier for the Santa Felicia,  Puddingstone, Cogswell and Brea dams.    The
              objective of this project is to:  (i) conduct a predictive  (Class A/B)
              computational analysis for each dam using the dynamic  properties identified
              earlier from the San Fernando and/or  Whittier earthquakes, (ii) critically
              assess the previously  identified earth dam characteristics in view of the
              newly  acquired Northridge data set (of different shaking amplitudes and 
              frequency contents), (iii) define simplified analysis/design  procedures, and
              clearly identify any associated limitations  and/or strengths, and (iv)
              document the identified properties in  a database form that includes a large
              number of modern  earth/rockfill dams in Northern California (Lexington,
              Anderson  and Long Valley dams), Southern California (Santa Felicia, 
              Puddingstone, and Brea dams), and Mexico (La Vilita and El  Infiernillo dams).
