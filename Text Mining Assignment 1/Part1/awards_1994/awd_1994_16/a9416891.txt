Abstract    :
              9416891  Vary    This grant supports the participation by five young scientists 
              from Eastern Europe at the "Fundamental Particle and Nuclear  Physics Summer
              School and Workshop" in August 1994.  The  workshop, supported by a prior NSF
              grant, is organized by the  International Institute of Theoretical and Applied
              Physics of  Iowa State University, under the leadership of Dr. James P. Vary 
              and Dr. Bing-Lin Young, in cooperation with the Institute for  Nuclear Research
              of the Russian Academy of Sciences, under  Director Victor A. Matveev.  The
              CTEQ (Project on Collaborative  Theoretical and Experimental Studies in QCD)
              Collaboration is a  research group having the goal of advancing Quantum 
              Chromodynamics (QCD) theory, experiment and phenomenology in a  systematic
              manner.  The CTEQ workshop will cover topics in  electroweak theory, not
              covered during the CTEQ summer school.       This proposed research in
              theoretical physics fulfills the  program objectives of advancing science by
              enabling leading  experts in the U.S. and Eastern Europe to combine
              complementary  talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual 
              interest and competence.  ***
