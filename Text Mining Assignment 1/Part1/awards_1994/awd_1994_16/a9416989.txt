Abstract    :
              9416989  Cande       There is a significant misfit, ranging from 50 to 250 kms, 
              of magnetic anomalies 13, 18, and 20 along the section of the  Southeast Indian
              Ridge east of the Balleny fracture zone.  This  project will survey the
              critical plate boundaries and relevant  magnetic anomalies in the South Tasman
              Sea, Emerald Basin and  north of the Ross Sea embayment that will better
              constrain the  history of the this plate motion.  Data collected will be used
              to  test the hypothesis that the Antarctic side of the ridge acted as  a
              separate plate, attached to Marie Byrd Land, and that these  anomalies
              indirectly indicate motion between East and West  Antarctica between anomalies
              24 and 13 time.  Surveys will be  conducted on the R/V W M Ewing in the Tasman
              Sea, and on the R/V  N B Palmer north of the Ross Sea embayment.  ***
