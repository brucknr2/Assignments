Abstract    :
              9416004  Nocedal    This Americas Program award will support a collaborative 
              research project between Dr. Jorge Nocedal, Northwestern  University, and Dr.
              Susana Gomez, Universidad Nacional  Autonoma de Mexico, on optimization
              techniques for seismic  inversion problems.  The researchers aim to determine 
              various material properties of the earth, such as slowness  and impedance, by
              using given sets of seismic data.  Seismic  inversion requires the solution of
              two optimization  problems: one highly non-linear and moderately large, and 
              another nearly quadratic and very large.  A new optimization  method, tailored
              to solve these optimization problems, will  be developed and tested on
              2-dimensional seismic models.    Determining the properties of the earth from
              seismic surface  data is of great practical importance.  The main obstacle to 
              the solution of the problem at present is the excessive  computing time
              required by current optimization techniques.  One of the goals of this study is
              to develop new techniques  that will speed up the inversion process in a fully 
              automatic manner.  The current project is enhanced by the  complementarity of
              the collaborators' expertise.  Dr.  Nocedal's main research has focused on the
              development of  new optimization algorithms capable of rapidly solving very 
              large problems, such as those arising in seismic inversion,  while Dr. Gomez
              has experience developing new methods for  global and non-differentiable
              optimization problems.  ***
