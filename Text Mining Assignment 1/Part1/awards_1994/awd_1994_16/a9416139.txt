Abstract    :
              9416139  Walser    This is a grant for the PI to plan an NSF Industry/University
                Cooperative Research Center on Magnetics at the University of Texas  at
              Austin.  The award provides funding for the planning,  determination of the
              feasibility and viability of developing an  Industry/University Cooperative
              Research Center at the University  of Texas at Austin with focus on research on
              the topic of  magnetics.  The funds are used for the administrative costs 
              involved in the preparation of an operational plan for the Center,  and in
              acquiring industrial support for the Center.  The  institution will plan and
              host a two meeting with potential  industrial partners to review potential
              research topics and  determine interest of industry to support the Center as 
              partners/collaborators/supporters.  The topics proposed for the  Center
              include: power electronics and telecommunications,  integrated
              electromagnetics, identification and security,  electromagnetic radiation
              control, and magnetic sensors.  Research  to be addressed by the center will
              include (1) synthesis,  processing and characterization of advanced magnetic
              materials,   (2) design, analysis, fabrication, and testing of novel magnetic 
              devices and,  (3) integration of advanced magnetic materials,  processing and
              devices, and  (4) transfer of novel technologies to  industry.    The success
              of the effort will be measured by the success of a  proposal to the National
              Science Foundation for support of the  planned Center as an Industry/
              University Cooperative Research  Center.    The Program Manager recommends the
              University of Texas at Austin be  awarded $24,993 for 6 months for this
              planning grant.
