              will continue a  program of high angular resolution observations of binary star
              systems using  speckle techniques.  Binary stars are the only source for the
              fundamental  determination of stellar masses and can provide direct
              determinations of  stellar distances, radii, luminosities, and effective
              temperatures.  The Georgia  State University program of binary star speckle
              interferometry began in 1975  and has continued its original emphasis on
              obtaining significant numbers of  well calibrated observations at large
              aperture telescopes.  These data are  being used to greatly improve the orbital
              elements of known binaries and to  calculate the orbits of resolved
              spectroscopic systems and other newly  discovered binaries.
