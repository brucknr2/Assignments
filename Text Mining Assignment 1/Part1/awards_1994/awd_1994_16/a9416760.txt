Abstract    :
              9416760  Johnson    This study will determine whether areas of concentrated
              damage to houses, roads and other  structures can be ascribed to areas of
              localized ground deformation along buried faults during  the January 17, 1994
              Northridge earthquake.  Preliminary investigations have identified zones  of
              fracturing in the vicinity of Tampa Avenue and Balboa Avenue.  Details of
              ground  deformation will be assessed with pre- and post-earthquake ground
              surveys and aerial  photographs.  measurements of changes in length of lines
              between manhole covers, fire  hydrants, etc. will be used to prepare a
              detailed, two-dimensional strain grid map.  The results  will indicate whether
              the localized damage in the stud areas after the Northridge event was due 
              primarily to ground deformation, or to some other mechanism such as shaking in
              valley fill, and  will thus help in evaluating the seisin hazard of other areas
              of the Los Angeles basin that contain  buried faults.
