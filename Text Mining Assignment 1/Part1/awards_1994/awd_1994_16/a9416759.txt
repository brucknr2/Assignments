Abstract    :
              9416759  Sozen  This project conducts a detailed evaluation of shear  failures
              observed in bridge piers during the Northridge  Earthquake.  The primary
              objective of this study is to  develop design and strengthening criteria for
              similar  structures in regions of low to moderate seismicity.    It is well
              known that many aspects of the shear strength of  reinforced concrete elements
              are poorly understood.  Applicability of existing design criteria are limited
              to  the ranges of the variables involved in available  experience and
              experiments.  A reinterpretation of the  available procedures and experimental
              data for shear  strength are needed in the light of both positive and  negative
              experiences during the Northridge event.  Such a  study is needed primarily
              because of observations that  probable maximum unit shear stresses sustained by
              bridge  piers failing in shear during the Northridge Earthquake  were
              decisively less than measured unit shear strengths of  comparable test
              specimens reported in the literature.    Old as well as new hypotheses for
              shear strength will be  evaluated in the light of (a) existing experimental
              data  and (b) data from damaged and undamaged piers during the  Northridge 
              event.  A set of design criteria applicable to similar  structures in regions
              of low to moderate seismicity will be  assembled on the results of this study. 
                This is a Northridge Earthquake project.  ***
