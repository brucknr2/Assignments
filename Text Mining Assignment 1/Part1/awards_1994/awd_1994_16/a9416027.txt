Abstract    :
              9416027  Soll  Gravity is one of the primary environmental signals  determining
              the orientation of root and shoot growth in many  plant species.  The
              gravitropic response involves perception  of the gravity signal, transmission
              of the signal, and  execution of a response program that re-orients growth. 
              Thus gravitropism constitutes a plant signal transduction  pathway.  This
              pathway is known to depend on tranport and  reception of the plant hormone
              auxin.  This research is  designed to identify and characterize genes involved
              in the  gravitropic response in Arabidopsis thaliana.  Several  mutants with
              defects in gravitropism have already been  isolated.  The focus here will be on
              the anlysis of two  especially promising mutants, rgr1 and rcn1.  The data 
              indicates that the RCN1 gene encodes a phosphoprotein  phosphatase, suggesting
              a specific role for RCN1 in  gravitropic signal transduction; the role of RGR1
              remains  unknown.  Work will continue on physiological and genetic 
              characterization of the mutants, to establish the functions  of the RGR1 and
              RCN1 genes.  Molecular cloning and  characterization of wild-type alleles will
              further define  these roles.  Wild-type clones will be re-introduced into 
              Arabidopsis by Agrobacterium-mediated stable transformation  to test for
              complementation of mutant phenotypes.  Stable  transformation experiemtns also
              will be used to demonstrate  the biological effects of altering the normal
              expression  pattersn of these genes.  Genetic and molecular approaches  will be
              used to elucidate interactions of the RGR1 and RCN1  genes with each other and
              with other genes involved in  gravitropism.  This work will provide new
              insights into the  molecular mechanisms of gravitropism and of auxin-mediated 
              signal transduction in plants.  ***
