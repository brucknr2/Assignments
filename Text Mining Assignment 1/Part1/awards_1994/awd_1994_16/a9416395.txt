Abstract    :
              9416395  Zage    This project funds an Industry/University Cooperative Research 
              Fellowship in which Drs. Wayne and Delores Zage of Ball State  University will
              conduct a study "Using Design Metrics Feedback  During Software Development." 
              The researchers are an integral part  of Purdue University/University of
              Florida's  Industry/University  Cooperative Research Center for Software
              Engineering.  This study  is to be conducted at and cost shared by the Northrop
              Corp.    The research will evaluate the performance of the design metrics 
              developed at Ball State University as it is applied to ongoing  software
              development in a controlled industry experiment.    The researchers are
              nationally recognized experts in their field  and well qualified to perform
              this project.    The Program Manager recommends Ball State University be
              awarded  $15,000 for one year for this project.
