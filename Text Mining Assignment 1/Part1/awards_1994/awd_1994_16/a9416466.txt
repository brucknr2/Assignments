Abstract    :
              9416466  Stanton  A number of reinforced concrete structures collapsed, either 
              partially or totally, in the Northridge earthquake.  Some of  the collapses
              were attributed to the failure of columns  which were designed for gravity
              loads only.  Many engineers  perform the evaluation in terms of the moment
              strength of  the columns.  This is an inappropriate approach because the  real
              issue is rotation capacity and not moment capacity.    The research undertaken
              here will investigate two aspects of  the issue.  The first is to develop
              analytical tools with  which to predict the story drift that a column can
              undergo  without failure.  The approach to be used is to construct  interaction
              diagrams relating axial force to curvature  capacity, rather than the
              conventional axial load to moment  capacity.  Curvature is related to rotation
              which in turn  can be used to predict story drift capacity.  The vertical 
              accelerations and the shear strength will be taken into  consideration in the
              analysis.    Innovative column details will be developed that will permit 
              larger inelastic rotations before failure.  One approach is  to detail all
              columns using the full seismic ties required  in the lateral load resisting
              part of the frame.  Other  details will be developed that depend on either
              providing  local flexibility at the column ends or on providing  localized
              confinement to prevent bursting and/or shear  failure.  These column details
              which will be simple,  economical, and easy to inspect and build will be 
              recommended.    This is a Northridge Earthquake project.  ***
