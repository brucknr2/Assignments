Abstract    :
                      9416752  Mullen  This research is intended to advance the understanding
              of the  mechanical behavior of silicon at the micro- and nano-scale levels  in
              order to improve the mechanical reliability of  microelectromechanical systems
              (MEMS).  The proposed research seeks  to provide a sound fracture mechanics
              base for polysilicon MEMS  devices and a sound materials science base relating
              processing  parameters to polysilicon microstructures and polysilicon 
              microstructures to mechanical behavior.  The overall aim is to  understand and
              significantly improve the mechanical reliability of  polysilicon MEMS devices
              by combining the research expertise of  applied mechanicians, materials
              scientists and electrical  engineers.  This synergistic collaboration will lead
              to new  knowledge that will significantly improve the design, fabrication  and
              utility of MEMS devices.  ***
