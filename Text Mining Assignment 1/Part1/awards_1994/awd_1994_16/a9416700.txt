Abstract    :
              The investigators propose to analyze a data set obtained in 1993  from the ALOHA
              portion of the ALOHA/ANLC (Airborne Noctilucent  Cloud Campaign).  This data
              was taken by the Michelson  Interferometer (MI) aboard the NCAR aircraft.  The
              goals of this  analysis are:  (1) to identify large-scale structures present in
               the OH radiance and temperature, and correlate them with the  presence/absence
              of the Quasi-Monochromatic Events (QME) seen in  the on-board airglow imager;
              (2) to perform a power spectral  density analysis of the OH radiance and
              temperature in both the  presence and absence of the QME seen in the on-board
              imager; and  (3) to correlate these results with the vertical structures seen
              in  the sodium lidar.
