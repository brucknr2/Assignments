Abstract    :
              9416184  Perkins  This  project is being funded as part of the National 
              Earthquake  Hazards  Reduction Program's investigation into  the  causes  and 
              effects  of  the  January  17, 1994 Northridge  earthquake.   The 
              investigators  are developing models for estimating uninhabitable  dwellings
              from future earthquakes affecting the San Francisco Bay  Area.   This  project 
              takes advantage of the unique  opportunity  provided  by  the Northridge
              earthquake.  The investigators  will  determine  if the entire modeling process
              (including damage-based  intensity  mapping and dwelling unit data collection 
              techniques)  can  be  transferred to southern California and  to  a  different 
              fault mechanism (thrust vs.  strike-slip).  The project's goal is  to  examine 
              the effects of the Northridge earthquake on  housing  stock  and  mass care
              requirements to improve emergency planning,  disaster  response, and
              residential rebuilding efforts in  future  earthquakes either in southern
              California or other areas.  ***
