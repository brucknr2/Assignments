              Abstract  ATM-9416662  D'Arrigo, Rosanne D.  Columbia University  Title:
              Tree-Ring Data from Subantarctic Forests: Indices of  Southern Hemisphere   
              This award supports a project involving the development of high-  resolution,
              precisely-dated tree-ring chronologies from the  subantarctic land areas of
              Tasmania, New Zealand and Tierra del  Fuego and their utilization in the
              modeling and reconstruction of  indices of temperature and atmosphere-ocean
              circulation for the  Southern Hemisphere extratropical latitudes.  This project
              will 1.  develop additional ring-width as well as maximum latewood density 
              chronologies for subantarctic forest sites; 2. extend the Tasmania-  New
              Zealand paleotemperature records further back in time through  collections of
              subfossil wood material; 3. produce chronologies  from several additional tree
              species; and 4. continue to model and  reconstruct temperature and circulation
              indices for subantarctic  latitudes.  The information gleaned from this project
              will improve  our long-term (centuries to millennia), high-resolution
              perspective  of natural and recent climatic variability for a region of the 
              Southern Hemisphere with very sparse instrumental and paleoclimatic  data
              coverage.
