Abstract    :
              9416463  Cheng  This project investigates damage and collapse behavior of 
              MissionGothic Undercrossing and Bull-Creek Canyon Channel  bridges. Damaged
              structures on site were studied and field  observations extensively with
              eminent engineers in  California were exchanged. The tasks include: (1) failure
               criteria and nonlinear finite element analysis, (2)  structural modeling and
              response analysis, (3) effect of  interacting ground motions, (4) results
              synthesis, and (4)  recommendations on bridge code improvements.  Analysis 
              includes formulation of nonlinear finite elements and the  effect of
              interacting ground motion on structural response.  Analytical results will
              verify field observations and  enhance current practice in design and retrofit
              of bridges  in the US.    This is a Northridge Earthquake project.  ***
