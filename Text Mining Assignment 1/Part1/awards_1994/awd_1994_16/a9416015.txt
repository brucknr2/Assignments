Abstract    :
                    9416015  Evans  There is a specialized zone of cells with a prominent role
              in the  tropistic responses of maize roots.  This zone  the "postmitotic 
              isodiametric growth" (PIG) zone  is located between the meristem  and the
              elongation zone (EZ).  Gravistimulation induces rapid  membrane potential
              changes in this zone and, unlike the EZ, auxin  stimulates elongation in these
              cells.  Prior work has shown that  gravity-induced asymmetric enhancement of
              elongation in the PIG  zone is not mediated by auxin.  This project proposes to
              determine  whether a comparable PIG zone exists in Arabidopsis and to test 
              whether it plays a role in root gravitropism and thigmotropism in  Arabidopsis.
               The work will 1) use a new growth analysis system for  localized growth rate
              analyses, 2) combine a curvature analysis  system with feedback control of
              localized tissue orientation in  order to investigate the limits of the zone of
              gravity sensing, and  3) investigate the role of electrical signaling in the
              coordination  of root gravitropic and thigmotropic responses.  This work may 
              provide new detailed information on the nature of plant sensing of 
              environmental signals and the manner in which this sensing leads to  a
              coordinated growth response.  ***
