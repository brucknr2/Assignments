Abstract    :
              9416604  Monismith    This  project  consists of conducting a fairly
              comprehensive  field study of the dynamics of tidal estuarine flow using  a 
              combination of intensive studies of the local dynamics  with  longer-term
              moored measurements.  The central hypothesis  to  be  tested is the dominance
              of an along-stream local balance  of  forces.   Specific  questions to be 
              addressed  on  this  project  are:  (1) How significant are horizontal 
              advective  processes   relative  to  vertical  momentum   transfer   in 
              establishing  the  state of the water column?;  (2)  How  do  various 
              bathymetric configurations effect  this  relation?;  (3)  How  are vertical
              momentum transfer and mixing affected  by  stratification in the tidal flows of
              a  partially  mixed  estuary?;  (4)  More generally, if local balances 
              dominate,  are current ideas about the effects of stratification on the  energy
               bearing scales of turbulence sufficient  to  explain  the  structure  of the
              tidal flows measured in  the  field?;  and, (5) Can internal waves be observed
              in the velocity  and  density  fields? Are they a significant contributor  to 
              the  total variance of these fields?    ***
