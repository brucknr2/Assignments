Abstract    :
              The manner in which internal waves interact through flux divergences at critical
              layers to drive cross-stream circulations and geostrophic accelerations of the
              background flow will be investigated. This interaction will be studied
              analytically by setting internal waves with a Garrett-Munk spectrum in
              vertically and horizontally sheared geostrophic flows such as narrow and broad
              jets.
