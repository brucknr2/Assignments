Abstract    :
                                  9416140  SCHOENINGER  Accelerated bone loss with age in
              Eskimo populations has  interested anthropologists for decades. It is
              hypothesized  that diets high in protein and acidity are a contributing  factor
              in human bone replacement and bone loss (osteopenia).  The importance of diet
              is suggested by comparisons of pre-  and post-Contact Eskimos with Southwest
              Pueblo maize  agriculturalists. This dissertation project is designed to  test
              the hypothesis of dietary influences using controlled  animal feeding
              experiments and human skeletal populations.  In addition to providing insight
              into prehistoric  populations, this study contributes to our understanding of 
              skeletal changes among the elderly.  ***
