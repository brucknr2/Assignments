Abstract    :
              9416174  Iwan  The objective of this project is to determine the nature and 
              importance of potentially serious structural response problems  associated with
              near-field earthquake ground motions such as  those observed during the
              Northridge earthquake.  Measured near-  field ground motions from the
              Northridge earthquake indicate very  high velocities and pulse-like ground
              displacements.  These  motions are capable of causing high levels of demand for
              a wide  range of different types of structures including base-isolated 
              buildings and multi-story buildings.    The high velocity pulses observed in
              the near-field of the  Northridge earthquake are of great concern for the
              performance of  taller multi-story buildings.  The stress waves in the
              structure  that are caused by these high velocities can result in very high 
              story drift that may, in turn, cause failure of structural  elements. 
              Preliminary indications are that story drifts induced  by near-field velocity
              pulses during the Northridge earthquake  may have significantly exceeded the
              code allowable values.  In  light of the poor performance of a number of steel
              moment  resisting frame buildings in the earthquake, this is an issue  that
              demands urgent resolution.  In this project, simple linear  shear-beam model is
              employed to determine the magnitude of the  problem and to identify the factors
              that are most important in  developing solutions to the problem.    The results
              of this investigation will provide insights in to  whether changes are needed
              in the seismic design of multi-story  structures to account for the near-field
              effects.  If changes are  needed, they need to be identified as quickly as
              possible before  more serious consequences occur.  ***
