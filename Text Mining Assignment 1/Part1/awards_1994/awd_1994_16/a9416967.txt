Abstract    :
                This three-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative research in
              biophysical modeling between Xiao-Jing Wang of the University of Pittsburgh and
              David Hansel of the Ecole Polytechnique, Paliseau, France.  The objective of
              their research is to  undertake biophysical modeling of 40 Hz oscillations in
              neurons and neural systems.  They will address:  rhythmogenesis; network
              mechanisms underlying synchronization and large variability; and the
              intermittent nature of 40 Hz oscillations.   Rhythmic activity in mammalian
              brains at the 30 to 50 Hz oscillation rate has been shown to coincide with
              increased focal attention and may have important functional roles in perception
              and information processing.  The proposed collaboration focuses on these
              physiological and cognitive issues by combining unique abilities of the
              investigators. The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in
              biophysical modeling. This is complemented by the French investigator's
              expertise in the dynamics of large neural networks.  Their joint effort will
              advance our knowledge of the physiological and biophysical mechanisms
              underlying neuronal cooperative rhythmically and its role in the organization
              of mammalian brain activity.
