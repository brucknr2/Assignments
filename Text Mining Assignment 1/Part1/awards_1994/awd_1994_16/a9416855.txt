Abstract    :
              9416855  Sag    This three-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative 
              research in linguistics between Stanford University and the  University of 
              Paris VII.  The American investigator is Ivan  Sag and the French investigators
              are Anne Abeille and  Daniele Godard.  The objective of  their research is to 
              develop a description of the syntax of the French language  as a standard
              reference point for scientific study and as a  basis for the development of
              French language processing  computer technology.  The proposed research on
              French syntax  will be carried out within a linguistic framework developed  by
              the Stanford University group.  The framework is known as  Head-Driven Phrase
              Structure Grammar (HPSG).    Dr. Sag brings to this collaboration his expertise
              in  linguistics and computational linguistics.  This is  complemented by the
              French investigators' expertise in  French language and grammar.  As part of a
              larger  international collaboration, the French project will advance  Dr. Sag's
              effort to test his model as a standard for a  computational grammar and will
              provide linguists with a  comprehensive description of French grammar.  ***
