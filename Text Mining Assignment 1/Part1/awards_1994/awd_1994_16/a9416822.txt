Abstract    :
              9416822  Brown    Scientific visualization is a descriptive term for the use of 
              computer graphics and interactive techniques to gain insights  from scientific
              data, and the hardware and software of virtual  environments allow the
              scientists to interact with the data in  more natural ways than the typical
              screen, keyboard, and mouse  allow.  An invited workshop is planned for
              Hangzhou, P.R. China,  September 5-9, 1994, with selection for invitation to be
              based on  position papers.  The goals of the workshop are to bring together 
              researchers from the United States and China, as well as other  Asian countries
              such as Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore, to spend  three days of intensive
              brain-storming and accomplish the  following:  *Survey what is currently
              happening in the United States and  Asia.    *Identify future research and
              development issues and trends in  scientific visualization and virtual
              environments, looking at  both the technology and at possible new scientific
              applications.    *Identify research  collaborations between the United States
              and  the Chinese and other Asian researchers.    A workshop report will be
              produced, published in respected  journals such as Computers and Graphics and
              ACM SIGGRAPH's  Computers Graphics, and made widely available.  This award will
               cover the travel expenses of five researchers from the United  States.
