Abstract    :
              9416160  Feng  The Northridge earthquake of January 17, 1994 caused severe 
              damage to many bridges including the disastrous collapse of  seven bridges. 
              Preliminary investigations have shown that  some collapses are due to
              inadequate seat widths at  superstructure hinges, although most of them had
              been  retrofitted using cable restrainers.    This project investigates the
              seismic performance of bridges  to determine whether energy dissipation systems
              can be  effectively used at bridge hinges and other possible bridge  locations
              for seismic damage reduction.    The objectives of this project are to:  1)
              extensively  investigate the performance of cable restrainers at bridge  hinge
              locations during the Northridge earthquake; 2) examine  the effectiveness of
              dampers as hinge restrainers through  analysis of bridge response to the ground
              motion (including  the vertical component); 3)examine the effectiveness of 
              dampers installed at bridge abutments and bent caps as  restraining devices;
              and 4) compare different damper devices  including viscous, viscoeleastic,
              friction, and steel  yielding dampers and recommend appropriate damper devices 
              and installment configurations suitable for bridge  applications.  A bridge
              model of Gavin Canyon Undercrossing  which collapsed during the Northridge
              earthquake will be  used for the analysis with the aid of the nonlinear
              analysis  computer code NEABS.    Engineers of California Department of
              Transportation  (Caltrans) offered their strong support to ensure the  results
              of this research will be utilized for retrofitting  and in the new design of
              their bridges.  Caltrans will  provide technical assistance and will make a
              highway bridge  located in seismic-prone San Bernando, California, available 
              for the PI to perform field testing of energy dissipation  systems to be
              recommended as a result of this research.    This is a Northridge earthquake
              project.  ***
