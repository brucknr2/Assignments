Abstract    :
              CTS-9416921  Cramer  RPI      The performance of non-linear gradient and
              displacement chromatography techniques for the separation of proteins will be
              evaluated and optimized.  At present, the optimization of protein purification
              by chromatography is mainly empirical.  A multicomponent equilibrium model has
              been recently developed for non-linear ion-exchange chromatography.  Based on a
              steric mass transport (SMA) approach, this model has good predictive
              capabilities.  A systematic evaluation of gradient and displacement
              chromatography will be performed using the SMA approach.  Representative
              classes of model protein separation problems will be defined.  Experiments will
              be conducted with appropriate combinations of proteins, stationary phase
              materials and pH conditions.  Tests will be conducted with novel displacing
              agents, including some unusual low MW compounds, which are inexpensive and
              non-toxic.  The resolution and merits of gradient and displacement
              chromatography will be compared.  The productivity of these techniques will be
              analyzed and optimized using numerical techniques.  The development of
              efficient ion-exchange chromatographic techniques for process scale
              purification has the potential of a significant impact on bioprocessing
              technology.
