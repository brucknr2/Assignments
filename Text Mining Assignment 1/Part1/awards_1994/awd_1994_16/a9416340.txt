Abstract    :
              9416340  Helmberger    This research is to obtain aftershock source information
              from the  broad-band, high capability TERRAscope waveform data in conjunction 
              with the locations from the USGS-Caltech short-period array.  With  the sources
              fixed, propagational effects will be examined to  develop better velocity
              models and associated Green's functions for  the San Fernando region.  Thus,
              the larger events and mainshock can  be re-inverted for slip-distributions
              using these Green's  Functions.  In the process, the 3-D velocity model of the
              region  will have greatly improved and can be used to assess hazards 
              throughout the extended Los Angeles region.  This project is a  contribution to
              the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program  and is supported by the
              Northridge Earthquake Emergency  Appropriation.  ***
