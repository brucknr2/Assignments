Abstract    :
              9416213  Davis    This research is to complete the archival and begin analysis
              of  data from a 98 seismic station array installed immediately after  the 1994
              Northridge earthquake to explain the extreme damage from  the main shock in
              Sherman Oaks and Santa Monica.  Stations were  clustered in the high damage
              zones as well as along two linear  arrays that extended through the station
              clusters into the  aftershock zone.  One objective was to investigate whether
              the weak  ground motion from the aftershocks could be used to understand the 
              damage from the strong ground motion of the main shock, the  question of
              strong-motion linearity.  Over 300 aftershocks were  recorded.  Preliminary
              analysis reveals that badly damaged areas do  indeed see large aftershock
              amplitudes relative to those of  undamaged areas with some exceptions.  This
              work seeks to analyze  systematically the propagation from the hypocentral zone
              to the  stations of the array to explain how propagation and site effects 
              contribute to the damaging ground motion.  Strong aftershock  shaking will be
              compared with detailed maps of red-tagged zones  provided by the LA City
              Council.  This project is a contribution to  the National Earthquake Hazard
              Reduction Program and is supported  by the Northridge Earthquake Emergency
              Appropriation.  ***
