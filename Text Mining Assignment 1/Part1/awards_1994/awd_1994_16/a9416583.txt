Abstract    :
              9416583  Reed    Studies of arc-continent collisions provide valuable insights
              into  orogenic processes and continental accretion. The Taiwan orogenic  belt
              provides a modern example of this process, which has served as  an important
              model for studying ancient orogens now exposed on  land. Uplift rates measured
              along the collision suture in  southeastern Taiwan are among the fastest in the
              world, yet little  is known about the crustal structure beneath this region or
              the  mechanisms responsible for uplift at the critical transition from 
              subduction to collision located in the offshore to the south of  Taiwan.    The
              present project  will provide detailed new information with  which to examine
              Taiwan crustal structure and the collision  process. Data to be acquired
              include multi-channel seismic  reflection and seismic refraction data from the
              offshore region, as  well as simultaneous crustal refraction measurements on
              land. A  major advantage to undertaking such a study in Taiwan is that 
              progressively younger stages of the propagating collision can be  viewed by
              moving southward along the collision zone. Thus, the  detailed aspects of the
              collision process can be examined from an  evolutionary perspective. Results
              from the project will be critical  in planning drilling by the Ocean Drilling
              Program. This is a  cooperative project supported by scientists at four U.S. 
              institutions and the Institute of Oceanography of the National  Taiwan
              University.  ***
