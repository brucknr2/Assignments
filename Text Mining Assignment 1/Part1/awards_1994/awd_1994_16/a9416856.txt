Abstract    :
              The interface between two immiscible liquids is important to many chemical and
              biological  processes of considerable significance.  This research project,
              supported by the Analytical and  Surface Chemistry Program, applies state of
              the art non-linear optical spectroscopic probes to  interrogate the structure
              and orientation of molecules at the oil-water interface.  This information  is
              useful for developing a molecular level understanding of such diverse areas as
              phase transfer  catalysis, solvent extraction, biological membranes, and
              environmental contamination of ground  waters.  Second harmonic generation and
              sum frequency generation at the liquid-liquid interface  will be used to
              provide the molecular level structural information sought.  Initial studies
              will  concentrate on the water-alkane, water-nitrobenzene, and
              water-benzonitrile systems, as well as  surfactant molecules adsorbed at these
              interfaces.    In order to understand ion transport, electron transport, and
              material transport between  immiscible liquid phases, a detailed knowledge of
              the molecular structure of the interface is  essential.  Non-linear optical
              spectroscopic probing of the interface can provide this information,  and forms
              the basis of this research project.  Results of this work will be important in
              such  technologically important and diverse areas as phase transfer catalysis,
              photochemical energy  conversion, and environmental clean-up operations.
