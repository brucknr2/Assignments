Abstract    :
              9416012  Goldman                          PROJECT ABSTRACT         The proposed
              research will investigate the importance  of uncoupling photosynthetic carbon
              incorporation and  nitrate uptake under low light conditions. Low light 
              conditions are common at the base of the euphotic zone where  episodic inputs
              of nutrients through mixing events might  trigger the rapid growth of large
              diatoms.  In addition,  studies will be performed on the role that diffusion
              may  play in the limitation of nitrate uptake and hence diatom  growth.  Those
              same experiments will also investigate the  possibility that diatom growth
              might become limited by free  CO2 as the pH rises and the total inorganic
              carbon pool  shrinks.  These studies will be performed in a series of 
              controlled laboratory experiments involving isolates of  large diatoms form the
              Sargasso Sea that are currently in  culture in the Principal Investigator's
              laboratory.  The  results will provide a basis for assessing important aspects 
              of the physiology of large phytoplankton species, their role  in new
              production, and the potential impact of molecular  diffusion in structuring the
              autotrophic portion of marine  food chains.
