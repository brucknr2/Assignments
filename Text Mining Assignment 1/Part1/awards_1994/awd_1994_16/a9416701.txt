              Abstract  ATM-9416701  Feldstein, Steven  Pennsylvania State University  Title:
              Low-Frequency Zonally-Averaged Flow Variability Studied with  Models and
              Observations    The primary objective of the proposed research is to
              investigate  the role of the zonally averaged flow on atmospheric low frequency
               variability.  A combined approach of examining the real  observations, the
              outputs of idealized simple models and realistic  complex global models is
              being adopted to achieve this goal.  This  approach can enhance our
              understanding of the fundamental dynamics  of low frequency variability of the
              atmosphere.  Details of  dynamical mechanisms associated with the maintenance,
              onset and  decay of both high and low zonal index phases will be examined.  
              Regional teleconnection patterns and blocking and their  relationship with
              zonal index will be studied.  The role of SST in  the interannual variability
              of the zonal index will also be  investigated.    Low frequency oscillations of
              the atmosphere are intimately related  to medium and extended range
              forecasting. This research has  potential for improving forecast models and in
              turn forecasts.
