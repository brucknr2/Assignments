Abstract    :
              9416469  Lacy  During the Northridge, CA earthquake, the upstream face of the 
              Lower San Fernando dam spread laterally upstream several feet.  Surface cracks
              and sand boils developed.  The documentation of  the behavior is during of this
              during the Northridge earthquake  provides an opportunity to validate an
              existing state-of-the-art  method to analyze the seismic stability of earth
              dams, including  the prediction of liquefaction and permanent displacements.   
              Data collected at the Lower San Fernando dam during the  Northridge earthquake
              will be used to assess the reliability of  the dam during and after an
              earthquake event.  This will be  achieved by generating a sequence of possible
              realizations of the  ground motions and soil properties and analyzing each 
              deterministically using a general two-phase nonlinear finite  element
              procedure.  The ground motion at the base of the dam is  simulated according to
              a spectral content derived from  measurements at nearby bedrock sites.  The
              material properties  pertinent to the occurrence of liquefaction and strength
              are  treated as spatially varying random fields with mean, variance  and, where
              possible, spatial correlation structure derived from  actual measurements at
              the site.  The saturated soil in these  problems is treated as a two phase
              continuum of soil skeleton and  pore fluid. the porewater and soil skeleton
              behavior are fully  coupled, thereby accounting for the interaction between the
              two  media as the soil deforms.  The nonlinear elasto-plastic behavior  of the
              soil skeleton is modeled by multi-yield surface  plasticity.  for each
              analysis, time histories of soil response  are produced, including
              accelerations, displacements and pore  water pressures.  The resulting sequence
              of soil responses is  processed statistically to yield estimates of reliability
              of the  earth dam system.  ***
