Abstract    :
               9416288  Shapira  This Americas Program award will  support a two-year research
              collaboration between Dr. Donald Shapira, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL)
              , and a group of physicists from the Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). 
              The award will fund  travel  to Mexico and related expenses of Dr. Shapira and 
              three other U.S. scientists. The goal of the research is to establish a dynamic
              model that describes the fusion process of two heavy ions over a large range of
              energies. This project will perform a series of exclusive measurements of a
              large fraction of the products from collisions between two heavy nuclei.  The
              measurements will be done with a unique high-granularity logarithmic detector
              system, in conjunction with an array for charge particle detection.   Both
              research instruments, together with a new data acquisition system, are located
              at Texas A&M University, where the measurements will take place.      The
              establishment of a dynamic model that adequately describes the fusion process
              of two heavy ions is still an unsolved problem and would be a major
              accomplishment    The development of such a model requires both experimental 
              and systematic studies. This project will carry out the systematic studies.
