Abstract    :
              9416014  Duda     The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will undertake an 
              oceanographic technology project to design, construct, and test a  new type of
              deep ocean shearmeter drifter.  The measurement of  shear (the vertical
              gradient of horizontal velocity) in the deep  ocean is scientifically
              important, but has always been difficult  and expensive using existing
              technologies.  The 10 m-long drifters  will be simple in design, will have no
              moving parts, and will  convert shear to a measurable signal via their
              dynamics.  They will  be able to measure shear at a 10 meter vertical
              separation while  deployed at depths up to 5 km.  In addition, the drifters
              will be  able to remain deployed for up to a year.  They will consist of a 
              rotating vertical cylinder driven by flow past vanes at either end.   The
              rigidly mounted vanes will provide dynamic interaction with the  moving water. 
              The inclination of the long cylinder, as the result  of shear, will be measured
              by a sensitive on board tiltmeter and  related to shear direction and
              intensity.   Prototype testing will  be done in test tanks and at a test
              facility in Seneca Lake, N.Y.
