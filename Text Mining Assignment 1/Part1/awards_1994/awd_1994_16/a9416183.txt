Abstract    :
              9416183  Arnold  This  project is being funded as part of the National 
              Earthquake  Hazards  Reduction Program's investigation into  the  causes  and 
              effects of the January 17, 1994 Northridge earthquake.  The study  aims  to 
              make  a  contribution to filling  a  gap  in  knowledge  relating  to  the
              direct and indirect effects of  earthquakes  by  undertaking  a  systematic 
              investigation  of  building   damage,  business   interruption  and  recovery 
              involving  a  significant  inventory  of  buildings and businesses in the
              epicentral  region  during   the   first  twelve  months  following  the  
              Northridge  earthquake.   The  study inventory consists of approximately  170 
              business  members of the Northridge Chamber of Commerce, together  with 
              approximately 200 stores at Northridge Fashion Center.   It  is  intended that
              the results of this study will provide  greatly  improved  understanding of the
              effects of such earthquakes  on  a  prototypical business community,
              significant input into  economic  models used for estimating direct and
              indirect economic losses in  future  earthquakes, and valuable insights into
              the  significance  of types of structural and nonstructural damage and their
              effects  on business viability.  ***
