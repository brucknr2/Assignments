Abstract    :
              9416470  Bourque  This  project is being funded as part of the National 
              Earthquake  Hazards  Reduction Program's investigation into  the  causes  and 
              effects  of  the  January 17, 1994 Northridge  earthquake.   This  award 
              provides funds for the timely analysis of perishable  data  collected from a
              representative sample of Los Angeles and Ventura  County   residents  following
               the  earthquake.   Analyses   will  contribute   information   relevant  to  
              behavior   during   and  immediately  after  the earthquake, use and value  of 
              electronic  media  as  a source of information, loss of utilities, prevalence 
              and  extent  of  damage,  prevalence and  extent  of  evacuation,  changes   in
               patterns  of  transportation,  and  pre-and   post-  earthquake preparedness.
