Abstract    :
              9416366  Roth  Twenty-three years after the 1971 San Fernando Earthquake, the 
              1994 Northridge, CA, Earthquake caused substantial damage to  earth structures,
              water conduit systems, and electrical equipment  of the Van Norman complex of
              the Los Angeles Department of Water  and Power (LADWP); specifically the Lower
              and Upper San Fernando  Dams, the Tailrace, and the Los Angeles Reservoir. 
              Ground  deformations were measured on four LADWP earth structures, and  there
              were seventeen strong-motion recordings inside and around  the LADWP complex. 
              This well-instrumented site provides a  special opportunity to study the
              permanent deformations and  failure and the post-earthquake stability of
              liquefiable soils  and earth structures subjected to severe (0.98 g) ground
              shaking.    This project involves three institutions: the University of 
              Southern California (Part I), Dames & Moore (Part II), and Case  Western
              Reserve University (Part III).  The objective is to  analyze the ground
              deformations and failures in the Van Norman  complex following the 1994
              Northridge Earthquake; from both  research and engineering-practice points of
              view, based on state-  of-the-art field and laboratory measurements. 
              Coordination of  the three research teams is provided by the University of 
              Southern California.    The objective of Part I (University of Southern
              California) and  Part II (Dames & Moore) is to compare the 1971 with the 1994 
              observations of ground motions, and to investigate the validity  of nonlinear
              dynamic finite element analyses in well-documented  field studies.  The
              objective of Part III (Case Western Reserve  University ) is to characterize
              the soil and to establish its  liquefaction potential, using the unit energy
              method, at a number  of sites in the Van Norman complex where field
              observations and  measurements are available.  The results will be assembled in
              a  data base and made available to the engineering community, in  addition to
              being used in Parts I & II of this project.    It is expected th at this
              project will assist practicing engineers  and regulatory agencies to evaluate
              the capabilities and  limitations of available models for the seismic response
              of soils  and earth structures.  This action is to support Part II (Dames & 
              Moore) of this collaborative research project.  ***
