Abstract    :
              9416219  Dreger    This research is a multifaceted study of the Northridge
              mainshock  and large aftershocks to address the issues of fault zone 
              complexity, identification of slip planes, slip heterogeneity, as  well as the
              source contribution to the observed strong ground  motions.  Moment tensor
              methods will be used to study events to the  Mw4.5 level.  Forward modeling of
              aftershocks will be used to  refine theoretical Green's functions used in the
              moment tensor  analysis.  The Northridge sequence occurred in a geologically 
              complex region on a south-dipping reverse fault, adjacent to the  north-dipping
              structures involved in the 1971 San Fernando  earthquake.   Aftershocks do not
              define a clear fault plane at  depths shallower than 10 km and these methods
              will help to resolve  the complex geometry of faults in the region.  This
              project is a  contribution to the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program 
              and is supported by the Northridge Earthquake Emergency  Appropriation.  ***
