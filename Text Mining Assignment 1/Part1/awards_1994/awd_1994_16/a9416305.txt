Abstract    :
              9416305  Sanderson        ABSTRACT      Interactive Learning Module for
              Manufacturing Engineering    Working in partnership with Apple Computer, AT&T,
              IBM, and Northern Telecom Corporations, this Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
              Project has dual objectives: (1) Using multimedia and distance learning
              technologies to present case studies, expert commentaries, and manufacturing
              simulations, focusing on advanced electronics and electromechanical product
              sectors; and (2) Using the modular nature of these materials to widely
              disseminate them for use by industry and other institutions so as to impact
              different geographical, technological, corporate, and demographic sectors. 
              Based on excellent facilities and proven background in modular development
              enhanced by emerging video technologies and well-chosen industrial partners,
              this project can potentially lead to future means of manufacturing education.
