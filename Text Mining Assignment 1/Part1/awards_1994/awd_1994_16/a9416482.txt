Abstract    :
              9416482  Comerio  This  project is being funded as part of the National 
              Earthquake  Hazards  Reduction Program's investigation into  the  causes  and 
              effects  of  the  January  17, 1994 earthquake.   The  Northridge  earthquake
              in Los Angeles affected housing units in thousands  of  buildings.  The
              majority of these units were in apartments.  This  research  will  assess the
              number and type  of  units  lost,  the  ability  of owners to repair or replace
              affected units,  and  the  ability  of  the displaced tenants to find short 
              and  long  term  housing  alternatives.  To assess housing losses the 
              researchers  will  analyze data on damaged buildings assembled by the City  of 
              Los  Angeles.  To understand the impact on building  owners,  the  researchers
              will assess the number of units repaired or  replaced  one  year  after  the 
              event.  And to understand  the  impact  on  tenants,  the  researchers will
              analyze the short and  long  term  housing availability for displaced tenants.
