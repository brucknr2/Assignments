Abstract    :
              The long term goal of this research is to understand the  cell signaling that
              occurs between Arabidopsis pollen  (and/or pollen tubes) and the pistil.  This
              proposal  initiates an investigation of the molecules essential for 
              pollen-stigma communication.  Previous analyses of male-  sterile cer6-2
              Arabidopsis plants showed they produce pollen  lacking a normal extracellular
              coating.  While this coating  is essential for communication with the stigma,
              it is not  clear which of its components (lipids, proteins, small  molecules)
              play a critical role in communication.  This  proposal is aimed at
              characterizing further the signaling  component(s).  These experiments rely on
              recently developed  methods for obtaining large quantities of pollen and for 
              extracting the pollen coating.  When the extracted wild type  pollen coat is
              dried and added to the cer6-2 pollen, it  restores fertility, providing a
              bioassay; this bioassay will  allow initial purification of the active pollen
              coat  components.  Specifically, the coating from wild type grains  will be
              fractionated and each fraction will be added  separately to the mutant cer6-2
              pollen.  Restoration of  fertility will identify the active fraction(s). 
              Recent  experiments have shown that the Arabidopsis pollen coating  contains
              only a few proteins.  One or more of these proteins  may play a significant
              role i interaction with the stigma,  including adhesion of pollen to the
              stigmatic cells or  communication with the stigma.  The fractions prepared for 
              the bioassay experiments will also be used to characterize  the protein
              components.
