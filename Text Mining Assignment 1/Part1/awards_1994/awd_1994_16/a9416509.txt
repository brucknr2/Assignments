Abstract    :
              9416509  Synolakis  The objective of this project is to model the response of
              the Los  Angeles dam during the 1994 Northridge Earthquake.  This dam is 
              located about 6 miles from the epicenter of the earthquake, and  is inside the
              Van Norman complex of the Department of Water and  Power (DWP).  Lateral
              spreading, liquefaction and permanent  ground settlement were observed in the
              entire area of the Van  Norman complex.  The focus of this study is the
              impulsive motion  of the water surface in response to the earthquake-induced
              ground  motion, and the investigation of any seiche which may have been 
              produced.  The sloshing of the water surface following the  earthquake produced
              10 foot vertical runup distances measured  around the south-east side of the
              reservoir by the principal  investigator.  This observation implies that the
              measured runup  was about 12% of the depth: this is the primary motivation for 
              this study.    This project has three specific objectives:  1. To use the
              estimated ground motions under the dam to determine  if overtopping occurred
              during the earthquake.  2. To determine the profile of the tsunami wave or
              seiche which  can be produced in reservoirs with ground motions having 
              significant vertical accelerations.  3. If time permits, to use the measured
              runup heights and the  hydrodynamic model to infer the low-frequency content of
              the  earthquake spectra at this site (data which is not readily  available from
              measured strong-motion records), and to provide  another method for estimating
              the rotation and shift component of  the ground motion.  ***
