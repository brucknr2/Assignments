Abstract    :
              9416882  Bell    This three-year award requests support for U.S.-France 
              cooperative research in sensory systems between Curtis Bell  of the
              Neurological Science Institute of the Good Samaritan  Hospital in Portland,
              Oregon, and Kirsty Grant of the French  National Research Center for Scientific
              Research in Gif-sur-  Yvette, France.  The objective of their research is to
              study  neural signals in the brain of mormyrid electric fish.  They  will
              investigate adaptive synaptic plasticity and its role  in controlling sensory
              input into the brain.  This work  extends their previous in vivo studies to in
              vitro systems  which will allow them to investigate synaptic plasticity and 
              local brain circuitry.    The U.S. and French investigators are physiologists
              with  different and complementary research experience that are  essential to
              completion of this project.  Dr. Bell's  experience has been with in vivo
              systems whereas Dr. Grant  has had extensive experience with in vitro slice 
              preparations.    Their proposed project will advance our  understanding of
              sensory circuits and local brain circuitry.    ***
