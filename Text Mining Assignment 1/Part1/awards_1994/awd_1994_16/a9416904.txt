Abstract    :
              9416904  Katz    The objective of this project is to understand better the
              physical processes  which produce gamma-ray bursts.  Models have been developed
              in which a  debris shell from a relativistic fireball collides with
              interstellar gas.  Analytic  estimates have shown that this model may lead to
              gamma-ray bursts  consistent with those actually observed.  Dr. Katz will test
              these models by  replacing the estimates previously made with quantitative
              calculations.  The  method to be employed is that of numerical hydrodynamics,
              which permits  the quantitative calculation of the flow of fireball debris and
              interstellar  matter in almost arbitrarily complicated flows.
