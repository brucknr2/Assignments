Abstract    :
              9416866  Mass        The complex terrain of coastal regions, such as exists
              along most of the western U.S. coast, has a major  influence on local weather
              conditions.  The interactions of such terrain with various meteorological
              phenomena,  however, is not well-understood.        The primary objectives of
              this project are to study and document: the coastally-trapped disturbances that
               propagate along the mountainous coastline of western North America; and the
              interaction of the large-scale flow  and embedded disturbances (such as
              cyclones, troughs, and fronts) with coastal topography.        Using an
              existing research data set collected under the sponsorship of the Office of
              Naval Research and  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, this
              research effort will utilize both observational and  numerical modeling
              approaches.  First, the nature of orographically-trapped events and the
              interactions of the  synoptic-scale flow and coastal orography under stable
              summertime conditions will be examined.  Such features are  often associated
              with significant transitions in temperature, wind, pressure and cloudiness
              within approximately 100  km of coastal mountains.  Secondly, the project will
              address how the structures and dynamical balances of synoptic  systems such as
              troughs and fronts change as they approach and cross a mountainous coastline
              during wintertime,  less stable conditions.  Such  systems are often associated
              with significant coastal weather features such as mesoscale  coastal ridging,
              coastal jets and alongshore surges.  ***
