Abstract    :
              9416271  Gatz  This  project is being funded as part of the National  Earthquake
               Hazards  Reduction Program's investigation into  the  causes  and  effects  of
               the  January  17, 1994 earthquake.   Data   will  be  derived  from telephone
              interviews with 500 individuals  who  are  members  of  families  participating
              in an  ongoing  longitudinal  study  of  intergenerational family relations and
              mental  health.  The  focus of the interviews will be experiences during and
              after  the  earthquake,  including  family involvement  in  preparedness 
              efforts and the psychological impact of the earthquake.  Analyses  will
              address: the extent to which preparation is diffused through  family  networks,
              and what family-level mechanisms  encourage  or  impede preparation; the
              effects of family ties in moderating  the  impact  of the recent earthquake,
              and conversely, the effects  of  the   earthquake   on   family  ties;  and 
              age   difference   in  vulnerability.  ***
