Abstract    :
              9416620  Hart       This project will address a long-standing problem of 
              excessively high Sr isotopic ratio in oceanic peridotites by  testing the
              hypothesis that this signal results from the  presence of particles derived
              from continental crust and  carried deep into the peridotites by circulating
              seawater.  The hypothesis will be tested by analyzing other isotopic  systems,
              including Nd, Pb, Os and Be.  Confirmation of the  hypothesis would have major
              implications for global, and  oceanic, biochemical cycles and fluxes.  ***
