Abstract    :
              9416510  Kropp  This project addresses the damage resulting from the 1994 
              Northridge Earthquake to houses built on fill slopes.  "Wedge"  fills are often
              used to form cut/fill level building sites on  hillsides.  Numerous houses
              build on wedge fills experienced  substantial (though seldom catastrophic)
              damage as a result of  the earthquake; this, in the absence of any apparent
              large-scale  shear failure in the fill soils or building foundation materials, 
              such as landsliding or bearing capacity failure.  The damage  appears to have
              resulted from a combination of differential  ground shaking between the cut and
              fill portions of the building  pads, and from shaking-induced settlement and
              lateral ground  movements in the fill soils.    A primary objective of the
              project is to document the seismic  performance of "wedge" fills, especially
              recent fills constructed  to modern standards.  In order to gain further
              insight into the  patterns of stresses and strains developed in the fills under
               earthquake excitation, numerical tools for dynamic response  analysis of
              two-dimensional soil systems are used to model the  behavior of typical "wedge"
              fill sections during the Northridge  Earthquake.  The validity of these
              analyses are verified by  comparison with typical damage patterns observed
              following the  Northridge event.  Following completion of this work, promising 
              mitigation schemes will be identified; such as the use of  geosynthetic layers
              within the fills, the use of over-excavation  and thick blanket fills at the
              top of the embankment, and the  development of guidelines for setbacks of
              structures from the  cut/fill interface.  ***
