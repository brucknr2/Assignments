Abstract    :
              9416788  This grant will provide partial support for the attendance of about 
              eight scientists from the former Soviet Union (FSU) at the  symposium on
              Metal-Containing Polymeric Materials to be held at the  national meeting of the
              American Chemical Society, in Washington,  DC, on 21-26 August 1994.  %%%  It
              is part of our general effort to encourage cooperation with FSU  scientists and
              follows previous funding of a joint US-FSU workshop  on polymeric materials.
