Abstract    :
              9416775  Kassner    This is a high-risk, small grant for exploratory research
              (SGER) to  perform in-situ fatigue experiments in the transmission electron 
              microscope.  The classic metal-fatigue phenomenon is poorly  understood,
              partially because the dislocation dynamics of reversed  deformation has not
              been characterized.  Only limited success has  been achieved with direct
              observation of dislocations during cyclic  deformation, such as observed in
              in-situ cyclic or reversed plastic  deformation tests in the transmission
              electron microscope.  The  problem is associated with buckling of thin foils
              when the applied  tensile or shear stress is reversed.  Analysis shows that 
              dislocation movement can be reversed by tensile stressing in  alternating
              perpendicular directions, and buckling of the foil can  be avoided.  A new
              specimen holder has been designed by the  principal investigator for performing
              such mechanical tests in-situ  in the transmission electron microscope.  A
              series of in-situ  reversed deformation fatigue tests will be run and should
              provide  new insights into reversed deformation phenomena.    %%%  Fatigue of
              metal alloys can lead to unanticipated failure of metal  alloy components used
              in industrial machinery, transportation  systems, and related infrastructure
              areas.  This research should  provide improved understanding in this field.
