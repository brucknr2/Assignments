Abstract    :
              9416175  Henke  The aim of this project is to help advance the Nation's  ability
              to engineer freeway structures to resist  earthquakes.    The main objective is
              to provide detailed information on in  situ undegraded nonlinear inelastic
              shear stress vs strain  characteristics for the soil deposits at the sites of
              the  three freeway structures that collapsed during the 1994  Northridge
              earthquake.  The information is expected to be of  value to analytical
              investigations aimed at identifying the  roles of soil conditions in the
              collapses.  The sites are  the I-5/Highway 14 Interchange, Highway 118 close to
               Woodley, and I-10 at La Cienega.  Local soil conditions may  have amplified
              ground motions at these sites.  The main  feature of the project is that
              uncertainty caused by test-  related disturbances to in situ conditions is
              expected to be  held to a relatively low level.    Data is to be measured using
              a field prototype simplified in  situ torsional cylindrical impulse shear
              testing system  currently being constructed for the Federal Highway 
              administration (FHwA). This method provides detailed  information on in situ
              undegraded nonlinear inelastic shear  stress vs strain characteristic for soil
              deposits.  The  method addresses the well known, but not yet fully-resolved, 
              problem of obtaining detailed information on the soil  characteristics of
              interest without disturbing in situ  conditions excessively.  This problem can
              cause considerable  uncertainty in the results of earthquake analyses.    This
              project is being co-funded with the FHwA.  ***
