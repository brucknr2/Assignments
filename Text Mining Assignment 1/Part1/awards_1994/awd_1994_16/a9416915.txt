Abstract    :
              9416915  Arnold  This project is on research which would continue to develop 
              polymers with high affinities for either proteins or low  molecular weight
              pharmaceutical compounds, for the purpose of  selective separation and
              purification.  The selectivity of these  materials for proteins comes from
              flexible arrays of metal ions  that bind complementary arrays of functional
              groups on the target  molecule.  For small molecule separations, the
              selectivity arises  from shape-selective and functional cavities around a metal
               complex of a monomer and the desired chiral template.  The  specific goals of
              this research are to: (1) improve the  selectivity of templated polymers by
              using kinetically inert  metals; (2) adapt this template polymerization
              technique to the  preparation of chiral ligand-exchange adsorbents; (3) develop
              a  new template-crosslinking approach to prepare protein-specific  adsorbents;
              and (4) characterize protein interactions with  randomly-derivatized and
              patterned metal-containing surfaces.   This project has the potential to
              produce important advances in  separation technology for both large and small
              molecules.  ***
