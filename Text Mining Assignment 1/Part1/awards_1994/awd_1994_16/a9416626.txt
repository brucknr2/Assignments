Abstract    :
              9416626  Devol      In this project, the investigator will address one of the
              major  questions on the global carbon cycle: What determines the extent to 
              which organic carbon produced by primary production in the world  ocean
              survives mineralization and is buried in seafloor sediments?  The project will
              continue the investigator's past work in two  regions of the western Pacific
              margin, one off the U.S. Pacific  Northwest, the other off the coast of
              northwestern Mexico. It has   commonly been assumed that the amount of
              particulate organic   matter near the sediment-water interface determines the
              rate of  organic mineralization, or oxidation; the process is mediated by 
              heterotrophic  bacteria that use either dissolved oxygen or nitrate  as
              oxidant.  However, in this study the investigator will also  explore the
              possibly  that, when water column oxygen concentrations  are low, the
              concentrations of dissolved oxygen and nitrate (rather  than organic matter)
              may actually control mineralization rates. To  clarify these issues, the
              project will involve field measurements  of the rates of organic sedimentation,
              chemical reactions in the  sediments, and (by direct measurement) solute fluxes
              across the  sediment-water interface.
