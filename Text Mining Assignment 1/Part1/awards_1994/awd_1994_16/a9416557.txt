Abstract    :
              The focus of this project is understanding the mechanisms causing  the
              equatorial temperature and wind anomaly (ETWA) and its  relationship to the
              structure of the low-latitude ionosphere.  This  study will require a thorough
              understanding of the characteristics  of the low-latitude
              thermosphere-ionosphere system, including the  complex interaction of its
              dynamics, temperature, composition,  ionospheric density and electrodynamics. 
              Resulting knowledge will  lead to a definition of the electrodynamic forcing
              necessary to  reproduce the extreme conditions during ETWA observations.  
              Finally, the PI will determine if the E and F region wind and  conductivity
              fields simulated by the model can generate realistic  electric field
              signatures.
