Abstract    :
              This project is an investigation into the photochemistry of the 
              mesosphere/lower thermosphere ozone, where the goal is to  understand the
              chemistry of reactive species, atomic oxygen, ozone,  atomic hydrogen, and
              hydroxyl, in the mesosphere/lower  thermosphere.  The NCAR TIME-GCM model will
              be used to analyze sets  of simultaneous data of source molecules, radical
              species and  temperature obtained by ground based instruments and rocket borne 
              instruments.  The objectives of the investigation are (1) to assess  whether
              atomic oxygen and atomic hydrogen are in chemical  equilibrium in the test
              cases, (2) to determine whether  modifications are necessary for atomic oxygen
              production and loss  rates and/or the atomic hydrogen loss rate, and (3) to
              determine if  the unmodified chemistry will explain the atomic oxygen and
              atomic  hydrogen concentrations when the dynamics is adjusted to reproduce  the
              water and oxygen profiles.
