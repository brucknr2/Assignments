Abstract    :
              9416839  Kent       Gee, in collaboration Kent, will measure the  magnetization
              of 500 samples of basalt from the Ocean  Drilling Program and Deep Sea Drilling
              Project.  They will  also measure the magnetite chemistry on 100 samples by 
              electron microprobe.  The combined data will be used to  evaluate several
              hypotheses about the variation of the  intensity of magnetization of the ocean
              crust with the age  of the crust.  This variation may be related to magnetite 
              originally present in the basalts or it may be the result of  alteration.  This
              has been a long-standing enigma and these  researchers may have found the
              solution.  ***
