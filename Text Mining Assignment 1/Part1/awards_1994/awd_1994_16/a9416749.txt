Abstract    :
                9416749  Zimmer-Faust         The process of recruitment of pelagic larvae
              into  benthic habitats has been given serious attention in  biological
              oceanography because of its role as a  "bottleneck" in the population dynamics
              of marine organisms.  In the field of larval ecology, emphasis has been given
              to :  1) the hydrodynamics of larval delivery to the substratum,  2) the
              physiological and nutritional condition of larvae,  which provides information
              on survivorship in the field, and  3) chemical cues for larvae that dictate
              attachment sites in  the benthic environment.       Dr. Zimmer-Faust has found
              evidence that larvae of a  commercially important species, the American Oyster,
              respond  to a chemical in the water column that is sequestered by  adults of
              the same species.  This project will identify the  chemical composition of the
              cue, and perform in situ  evaluation of the role of this cue on larval
              settlement, and  will distinguish the role of this water-borne cue versus the 
              larval attraction to chemicals from surface films on  substrata, which has been
              repeatedly documented.       This project will contribute to the program's
              objective  of making incremental steps in the understanding of the  mechanisms
              which control the input of larval propagules into  adult populations.  If the
              role of water-borne chemical cues  is indeed significant, this work could lead
              to the  restructuring of current theory in the recruitment ecology  of marine
              organisms.
