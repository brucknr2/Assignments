Abstract    :
              9416276  Uang  This project addresses seismic performance of instrumented  steel
              moment-resisting frames.  The 1994 Northridge  earthquake caused widespread
              damage of beam-to-column moment  connections in more than fifty buildings. 
              This earthquake  shook not only steel framed buildings but also confidence 
              that the seismic design profession has long held for this  type of premier
              system. Although design, detailing, and  welding issues of steel moment
              connections remain to be  investigated experimentally, to improve seismic
              design of  this type of framing system it is also important to re  examine
              current seismic provisions.  The main objective of  this research project is to
              investigate factors that  contribute to damage of this type of frames at the 
              structural system level.    Many steel moment-resisting frames in the Los
              Angeles area  have been instrumented by the California Division of Mines  and
              Geology (CDMG).  Because of the high level of ground  shaking, the recorded
              response from this earthquake  represents the most valuable data of actual
              building  performance up to date.  Three instrumented buildings (two  office
              and one hospital buildings, ranging from 5 to 19  stories high) are selected
              for intensive study.  Time  history correlation and nonlinear dynamic analysis
              re  conducted to evaluate actual deformation demand (story  drifts, member and
              panel zone rotational demands).  The  relationship between the response
              modification factor and  the structural redundancy, which has not been
              addressed in  current seismic codes, is also addressed.    The results of this
              research project will provide  information on realistic deformation demand on
              moment  connections.  This information is essential for providing  guidelines
              for future testing of steel moment connections.  The research results on
              structural redundancy will further  provide a basis for developing a
              next-generation seismic  code.    This is a Northridge earthquake project.  ***
