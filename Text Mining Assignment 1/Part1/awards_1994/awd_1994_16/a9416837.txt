Abstract    :
                9416837  Vincent    This award will support the participation of ten American 
              scientists, mathematicians and engineers at a workshop on  the control of
              nonlinear dynamical systems entitled  "Control and Chaos" to be held in
              Honolulu, Hawaii in  June 1995.  The American organizer is Dr. Thomas Vincent
              of  the Department of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering at the  University
              of Arizona.  The Australian organizers are  Prof. A. I. Mees and Prof. K. L.
              Teo of the Department  of Mathematics from the University of Western Australia.
                 The objective of the workshop is to bring together experts in  dynamical
              systems theory and control theory to focus on the  problem of controlling
              nonlinear and potentially chaotic  systems using limited control effort.  The
              work has application  potential including such diverse fields as economic
              policy,  medicine, ecosystem management and manufacturing.  Assessment  
              considerations will play an important part of the workshop.  There currently
              exists controversy over claims that approaches  inspired by work on chaos
              provide unique ways to control systems  with complex behavior.  The workshop
              will also investigate   applications of control theory and consider new tools
              for   controlling complex problems of a practical interest.  The  Australian
              participants are being funded through the  Australian Department of Industry,
              Science and Technology.  Researchers from Japan and Great Britain will also be 
               participating in the wopkshop.
