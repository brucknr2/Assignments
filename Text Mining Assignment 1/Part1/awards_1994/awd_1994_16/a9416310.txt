Abstract    :
              This is a research project to analyze an extensive set of high latitude
              convection velocity measurements to examine  how plasma flow in the polar
              regions varies with magnetic activity and solar wind conditions.  The
              measurements  were made primarily with an HF coherent scatter radar located at
              Goose Bay, Labrador, over a six-year period.   The data will be used to define
              the properties of the convection that are characteristic of such factors as (1)
              the signs  of the interplanetary magnetic field components, (2) the relative
              magnitudes of the IMF components, (3) season,  (4) geomagnetic disturbance
              level, and (5) time dependency.  The outputs of this study will be of value to
              modelers  of magnetospheric and neutral atmosphere dynamics and help understand
              the coupling mechanisms between the two.
