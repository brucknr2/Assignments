Abstract    :
                This project seeks to explain discrepancies the PIs have found  between
              ground-based Fabry-Perot measurements of thermospheric  winds and those
              predicted by numerical models.  Previous studies  have compared thermospheric
              models with single ground-based  stations, with data from limited periods using
              multiple northern  hemisphere stations, and with DE-2 spacecraft data for solar
               maximum only.  However, the PIs seek reasons for disagreement when  using data
              from multiple Fabry-Perot spectrometers at southern  polar latitudes.  In doing
              so, they will extend previous  comparisons away from solar maximum using
              multiple high latitude  southern hemisphere sites.  Results from the combined
              study will  present an observation-based description of the southern polar 
              thermosphere over a broad range of geophysical conditions.
