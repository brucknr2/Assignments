Abstract    :
              9416354  Wood  Tilt-up construction is widely used throughout the U.S. for low- 
              rise industrial and warehouse facilities.  Tilt-up buildings are  economical to
              construct, however, they are susceptible to seismic  damage.  Approximately 25%
              of the tilt-up buildings in the  epicentral area sustained structural damage
              during the 1994  Northridge earthquake.    The objective of this project is to
              develop procedures for  evaluating existing tilt-up construction and designing
              cost-  effective rehabilitation schemes.  Establishing a link between  the
              structural characteristics of the building and the expected  performance during
              an earthquake is emphasized in this study.    In-situ tests of tilt-up
              buildings will be conducted to evaluate  diaphragm stiffness, damping
              characteristics, and displacement  distributions.  The results of these tests,
              together with data  collected on tilt-up buildings damaged in the Northridge 
              earthquake, will be used to validate detailed analytical models  under
              development.  Existing retrofit requirements as well as the  latest proposed
              changes will be reviewed and summarized.  Typical  rehabilitation schemes will
              be evaluated.    Alternate analytical models and design methodology that are 
              consistent with dynamic behavior of tilt-up construction will be  developed.   
              The results of this investigation will provide a basis for  evaluating the
              seismic vulnerability of and developing cost-  effective rehabilitation schemes
              for the large number of  potentially hazardous tilt-up buildings throughout the
              U.S.    This is a Northridge Earthquake project, involving complementary 
              efforts between the University of Illinois and a consulting  engineering firm,
              Wiss, Janney, Elstner and Associates.  ***
