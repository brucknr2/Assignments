              Abstract  ATM-9416597  Broecker, Wallace S.  Columbia University  Title: AMS
              Radiocarbon Measurements Aimed at Improving Our       Understanding of the
              Events Associated with the Last Glacial       Termination    The objective of
              this project is to learn more about the nature of  the climate changes which
              brought the Earth from full glacial to  full interglacial conditions between
              14,500 and 9,500 14C years  ago.  Two aspects are addressed.  As heat transport
              to high  latitudes depends critically on the pattern and rate of deep sea 
              ventilation we need to learn more about paleo circulation.   Radiocarbon
              measurements on coexisting planktic and benthic  foraminifera from deep sea
              sediments offer important and as yet  largely untapped information.  Second,
              ocean circulation may have  ceased between Heinrich layer #1 (14,300 14C years
              ago) and the  onset of the Bolling (12,700 14C years ago).  Evidence is 
              accumulating that a pronounced trans-USA wet event following the  pattern seen
              during El Ninos occurred during this time interval.
