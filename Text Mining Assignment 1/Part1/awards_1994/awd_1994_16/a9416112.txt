Abstract    :
              9416112  Roeder  Cracking has been noted on approximately 50 steel frame 
              buildings as a result of the Northridge Earthquake.  Considerable concerns have
              been expressed about the welding  practice and procedures used on these
              structures.  These  welding concerns are clearly well placed, but it is
              unlikely  that these are the sole source of the steel frame cracking.  The
              progression of cracking into the steel column and panel  zone suggest that
              factors in addition to the welds affect  the process.  At the same time, there
              have been changes in  the professional practice and seismic design codes for
              steel  moment frames during the past 10 years.    This research project will
              determine if the recent changes  in seismic design practice have combined with
              welds and  contributed to the cracking problem.  The research will  examine the
              cause of cracking and possible solutions.  A  subcontract to the consulting
              firm of Brandow and Johnston  will be involved in this study to provide design
              drawings,  detailed advice, practical insight and information on the  damaged
              buildings.  Three buildings will be selected for  investigation.  A series of
              global elastic and inelastic  analysis of the structures will be performed
              using the best  available information for the shaking experienced by the 
              buildings.  Detailed elastic and nonlinear analysis of  critical areas will be
              used to examine the weak links, the  sequence of yield and cracking and the
              estimated resistance  of the critical components.  The effect of alternate
              design  provisions to the UBC provisions would be predicted and  examined.   A
              limited series of experiments examining weld  effects will be performed, and
              the experiments will be  correlated to the analytical results.    This is a
              Northridge Earthquake project.  ***
