Abstract    :
              9416304   Sahai   Thin Strip casting process for stainless and plain carbon
              steel, and aluminum are under development in companies around the world.  While
              empirical feasibility has been demonstrated by industrial members, the process
              is not sufficiently well understood to provide the process parameters for
              robust manufacturing operation to achieve maximum yield.  In this research,
              numerical simulation will be carried out and verified with industrial data from
              both Single Roller as well as Twin Roller Strip Casters in aluminum as well as
              steel.  The ensuping model can predict the rate of cooling which controls the
              microstructure which in turn determines the final mechanical properties of the
              cast strip.  This research will dove tail with similar effort at Temple
              University and Drexel University.   In the current manufacturing practice, thin
              steel sheets used to build car bodies and thin aluminum foils used in the
              kitchen, start as large ingots and are rolled numerous times to bring the
              thickness down.  This process involves several manufacturing steps consuming
              lots of energy, adding to work in process (inventory) and slowing delivery to
              customers.  This novel approach of casting strips directly if well understood
              and controlled to a high degree of reliability without sacrificing yields has
              the potential to reduce the manufacturing cost significantly.  International
              competition is intense since the stakes are high for primary metals industry. 
              Proposed collaboration with domestic steel and aluminum industrial partners in
              this research will immensely help both research content and manufacturing
              relevance.
