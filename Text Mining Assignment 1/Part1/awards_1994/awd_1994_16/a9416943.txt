Abstract    :
              9416943  Levinton                  The purpose of this project is to understand 
              the adaptations of complex particle processing mechanisms  and limitations of
              bivalve mollusks by means of direct  manipulative experiments using state of
              the art  observational techniques.   Dr. Levinton and colleagues will  focus on
              bivalve mollusks, owing to their great impact on  benthic-pelagic coupling in
              coastal ecosystems.  They have a  large range of particle feeding modes and
              they are amenable  to tests of models of particle processing.  They will 
              examine the responses and limiting factors of suspension  feeding and deposit
              feeding bivalves, when exposed to a  natural ranges of particle qualities and
              total particle  loads.  Variations in response have proven to affect various 
              aspects of bivalve feeding, which in turn strongly affects  the suspended
              matter in a shallow coastal ecosystem and the  nature of the organic matter
              that is biodeposited on the  sediment surface.  There is, therefore, an
              important link  between bivalve feeding adaptations and coastal  oceanography.
