Abstract    :
              9416247  Moriwaki  The Joseph Jensen Filtration Plant (JFP) in the San Fernando 
              Valley, California, provides an unprecedented case history  of seismically
              induced permanent ground deformations. The  site has been strongly shaken by
              two earthquakes-the 1971  San Fernando earthquake and the 1994 Northridge
              earthquake.  These two earthquakes produced large permanent ground 
              deformations and ground cracks at parts of the site.    The site was thoroughly
              investigated and studied following  the San Fernando earthquake, leading to a
              conclusion that  the loose alluvium underlying the fill (up to 50 ft thick)  at
              the site probably liquefied and contributed to the  permanent ground
              deformations.  In 1988, the owner and  operator of the plant, the Metropolitan
              Water District of  Southern California (Metropolitan), contracted a thorough 
              geotechnical and seismic investigation of the site prior to  a major expansion
              of the facility.  Following the 1994  earthquake, Woodward-Clyde has been
              working with the  Metropolitan to map the permanent ground deformations, 
              ground cracks, and other damage at the site.    The project involves the
              following:  an assessment of the  site conditions; the development of
              free-field ground  motions at the site corresponding to the 1994 earthquake; 
              and the documentation, simplified analyses, and nonlinear  numerical analyses
              of permanent ground deformations at the  site due to the 1971 and 1994
              earthquakes.  The  documentation, comparison, and evaluation of the permanent 
              ground deformations at the JFP site during these two  earthquakes not only
              provides a unique and important case  history of ground failure, but also
              provides an opportunity  to evaluate the use of nonlinear numerical modeling of
              the  ground deformation as a practical and reliable design tool.  Evaluations
              with conventional and empirical methods also  serve to provide a common basis
              for comparison.  ***
