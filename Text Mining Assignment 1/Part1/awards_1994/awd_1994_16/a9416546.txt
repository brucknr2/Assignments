Abstract    :
              9416546  Beroza    This research is to model strong-motion data of the
              Northridge  earthquake in order to estimate the factors controlling earthquake 
              rupture and to understand the component of the strong ground motion 
              attributable to the earthquake source.  A unique aspect of the  near-source
              data for this earthquake is that a number of high  dynamic range digital
              accelerographs recorded the initiation.  Like  the Loma Prieta and Landers
              earthquakes before it, the Northridge  earthquake began gradually before
              breaking out into a large event.   A goal is to understand how earthquakes
              nucleate.  Preliminary work  on this event and many other earthquakes indicates
              that there may  be a distinct nucleation phase at the beginning of most 
              earthquakes.  This project is a contribution to the National  Earthquake Hazard
              Reduction Program and is supported by the  Northridge Earthquake Emergency
              Appropriation.  ***
