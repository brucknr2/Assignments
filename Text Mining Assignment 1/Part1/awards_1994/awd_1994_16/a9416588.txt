Abstract    :
              9416588  Morgan       This is an accomplishment based renewal.  The principal 
              investigator will use theoretical models to explore a model for  melting and
              flow beneath hotspots and develop models that can  explore the interactions
              between melting at mid-ocean ridges and  melting at hotspots.  ***
