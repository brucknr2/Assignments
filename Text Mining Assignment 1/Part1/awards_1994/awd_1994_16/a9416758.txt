Abstract    :
              9416758  Gordon  This  project is being funded as part of the National 
              Earthquake  Hazards  Reduction Program's investigation into  the  causes  and 
              effects  of  the  January  17, 1994 Northridge  earthquake.   The  research 
              aims to : estimate the extent of business interruptions  resulting from the
              earthquake; undertake a one-year assessment of  the  extent  of post-earthquake
              business recovery in the  heavily  impacted  areas; and explore whether or not
              firms  have  adjusted  their   behavior   and  developed  earthquake 
              preparedness   and  mitigation  strategies  for the future.  The  methods  used
               will  include  a  mix of surveys and non-survey sources of information.  The
              project will also use the Southern California Planning Model.  ***
