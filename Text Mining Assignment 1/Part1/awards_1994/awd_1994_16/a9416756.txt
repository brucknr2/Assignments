Abstract    :
              9416756  Lettis    This study will produce a detailed map of liquefaction 
              susceptibility in the Simi Valley, Ventura County, California, an  area of
              rapid urban development.  Limited liquefaction and lateral  spreading occurred
              in the region during the January 17, 1994  Northridge earthquake, which
              presents an hitherto unassessed hazard  in this and other alluviated valleys of
              the Los Angeles area.   Liquefaction is generally restricted to areas within a
              narrow range  of identifiable geologic and hydrogeologic characteristics in 
              Quaternary deposits.  The distribution of Quaternary deposits will  be mapped
              at surface and in shallow subsurface, and liquefaction  susceptibility
              determined using the criteria set forth by the  California Division of Mines
              and Geology Seismic Hazards Mapping  group.  Primary areas of concern are
              historically-deposited  sediments and areas of saturated, poorly engineered
              artificial  fill.  Methodology will include field mapping at 1:24,000 and 
              collection of borehole data.  The final products will include a  digitized
              1:24,000-scale Quaternary geology map, a 1:24,000-scale  liquefaction
              susceptibility map and a final report, all of which  will be freely available
              to earth scientists, engineers, planners  and government agencies, including
              the USGS.  An easy-to-read  version of the final report will be made available
              for a lay  audience.  ***
