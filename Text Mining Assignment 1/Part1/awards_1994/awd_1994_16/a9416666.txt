Abstract    :
              9416666  Okogbaa       This research is focused on the development of modeling
              tools  for quality control that combines some aspects of Taguchi approach  and
              statistics.  The intended users of the tool are design  engineers.  The
              technique is based on parameter design.  Parameter  design involves and
              requires deep process knowledge and the ability  to carry out detailed
              statistical experimental design and analysis  to identify the critical process
              parameters.  Thus, the research  also involves the development of a prototype
              knowledge base expert  system with tandem architecture that consists of a
              knowledge base  and an algorithmic base to optimize the resulting design.  With
              the  knowledge-base in place, a user can implement parameter design  without
              engaging in detailed statistical experimental design and  the ensuing analyses.
                    The developed knowledge-base system for parameter design can  bridge the
              gap between some of the methodological differences  between Taguchi approach
              and some to the alternative approaches  proposed in the literature.  The
              successful implementation of  parameter design can lead to a reduction in
              quality losses.  It can  enhance the productivity of design engineers who do
              not have the  statistical background and resources to undertake the rigors of 
              comprehensive statistical experimental design.  This benefit is  particularly
              crucial in a concurrent engineering environment where  fast response time to
              design is highly desirable.
