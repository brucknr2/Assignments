Abstract    :
              OCE-9416971      Funding is provided for wireline drilling on drowned reefs in
              the  tropical Pacific atolls (Christmas and Kanton) to determine whether 
              tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures were significantly cooler  in the
              past, as well as provide information about the behavior El  Nino Southern
              Oscillation.  In global change framework, the  response of tropical sea surface
              temperatures to increasing  atmospheric CO2 and other radiatively important
              trace gases is hard  to predict accurately.  Fundamental to these predictions
              is an  understanding of whether tropical sea surface temperatures have  been
              constant throughout the past or varied up to 5 degrees C in  less than 5000
              years.
