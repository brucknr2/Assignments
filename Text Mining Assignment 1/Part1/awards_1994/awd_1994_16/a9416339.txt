Abstract    :
              9416339  Gephart    This research involves the use of approximately 1000 well- 
              constrained aftershock focal mechanisms to estimate the state of  stress in the
              vicinity of the mainshock fault plane of the  Northridge earthquake.  Within
              the aftershock data set, the  considerable diversity of focal mechanisms,
              observed both locally  and across the aftershock region, may enable very
              well-constrained  estimates of stress.  Following an established technique,
              among a  group of focal mechanisms, a stress tensor is sought that most 
              closely predicts the observed direction of slip on at least one of  the nodal
              planes of each mechanism.  This analysis yields only four  of the six numbers
              of the stress tensor, but requires no  assumptions about the absolute
              magnitudes of shear or normal stress  in the region, which are generally poorly
              known.  By dividing the  data into subsets, possible spatial and temporal
              variations in the  stress field can be assessed.  This project is a
              contribution to  the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program and is
              supported  by the Northridge Earthquake Emergency Appropriation.  ***
