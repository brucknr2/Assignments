Abstract    :
              9416807  Giblin    This project will compare the stoichiometric relationships
              among benthic fluxes of  oxygen, carbon, sulfur, nitrogen and phosphorous from
              sediments in a variety of lakes.  Investigators will use a comparative
              ecosystem approach and a process-based diagenetic model to examine the factors
              which control regeneration of nitrogen and phosphorus from sediments.  They
              will examine how the release of nitrogen and phosphorus changes in lakes across
              gradients of organic matter deposition, water chemistry, sediment chemistry and
              bottom water oxygen concentration.  The data to be examined include: 
              multi-year data sets from Lakes in the Hubbard Brook, Northern Lakes and Arctic
              LTER sites; shorter term data sets from about 50 temperate and arctic lakes;
              data from several experiments where carbon inputs to the sediments and
              overlying water chemistry were manipulated in intact sediment cores; and data
              from two whole lake fertilization experiments.  Investigators will use this
              data to generate improved conceptual and numerical models of the controls of
              nutrient release from freshwater sediments.  These models will provide tools
              for the management of water quality in lakes and estuaries.
