Abstract    :
              9416121  Yeats    This project will map the three-dimensional geology of the
              northern San Fernando Valley using  surface data and subsurface data from oil
              and water wells.  Preliminary work in the Ventura  basin to the east of the San
              Fernando Valley has shown that the Santa Susana fault steepens  down only where
              north-dipping reverse faults overlie south-dipping blind thrusts.  Other 
              preliminary work indicates that there is a north-vergent anticline with its
              crest at Oat Mountain  near the maximum uplift recorded by the January 17, 1994
              Northridge earthquake; the north  flank of the anticline is thought to be
              related to the blind thrust.  Mapping surface and  subsurface data in the
              northern San Fernando Valley will provide a detailed evaluation of the 
              presence and seismic potential of other blind thrusts in the region.
