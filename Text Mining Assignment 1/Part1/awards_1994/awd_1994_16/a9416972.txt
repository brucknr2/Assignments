Abstract    :
              9415673  Brady    This three-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative 
              research in chemical engineering between John F. Brady of  the California
              Institute of Technology and Georges Bossis of  the University of Nice.  The
              objectives of their research  are to demonstrate that short-term range
              repulsion does not  change the rheological behavior of hard-sphere suspensions 
              and to determine the minimum size of a particle which can be  used in
              electrorheological fluids without melting the  chemical chains.  The research
              involves the use of Stokesian  dynamics.  The will work on a third, but related
              project, a  monograph on suspension of dynamics.    The U.S. and French
              investigators have a long-standing  collaboration and are co-inventors of
              Stokesian dynamics.  The U.S. investigator and his group will carry out the 
              electrorheological fluid simulations.  This will be  complemented by French
              investigators work on the simulations  of short-term range repulsions.  The
              project will advance  our understanding of the physics of suspensions and their
               role in the engineering of new materials.  ***
