Abstract    :
              Support for this project will incorporate measurements of  ionospheric
              parameters from the DMSP spacecraft into various data  bases.  These parameters
              include the ion concentration,  composition, and temperature, the electron
              temperature, and the ion  drift velocity.  The CEDAR science area influenced by
              this data  that the PI plans to study is sub-auroral.  A number of objectives 
              are:  (1) studying the penetration of energy fields to lower  latitudes as seen
              by the Millstone Hill radar during magnetic  storms with the addition of the
              DMSP data, (2) obtaining conjugate  data from the southern hemisphere, and (3)
              extending the study to  the SAR arc features that accompany the polarization
              jets through  the availability of electron temperature.  Finally, other NSF 
              initiatives (i.e., MISETA and Jicamarca campaigns) will benefit  from DMSP
              measurements.
