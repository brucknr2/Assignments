Abstract    :
              9416101  Albanese       This encoding technique was motivated by a trial
              offering a  low cost "Best Effort" ATM/Cell Relay Service. The service is being
               used to explore applications for ATM services with unpredictable 
              (no-guarantees) Quality Of Service (QOS).  An initial contribution  was
              submitted to the Enterprise Network Roundtable (ENR) user group  of the ATM
              Forum describing the feasibility of a video multicast  application over
              Unspecified Bit Rate (UBR) services.  Our  contribution proposes to implement a
              new, optional and selective  multilevel Forward Error Correction (FEC) method
              in the application  layer based on information priority levels versus having a
              fixed  FEC implementation in the lower layers.       Preliminary research has
              consisted in software simulation and  initial implementations of PET systems
              using deterministic  algorithms like polynomial and linear independent
              equations over  finite fields.  These algorithms are quadratic in complexity
              and  the message-size/packet-size ratio limits its application to  recovering
              IP packet losses only.        Proposed work includes: 1) exploring firmware
              implementations  and the use of probabilistic algorithms to achieve faster
              software  implementations required to recover IP packets and ATM cell losses 
              in real-time MPEG-2 and JPEG video streams, where delay is a key  issue for
              interactive applications;  2) exploring mechanisms based  on user priorities
              for network routers to discard/filter large  amounts of packets that could
              cause congestion in low performance  networks and receivers during video
              multicast transmission by high  performance workstations, 3) realizing
              performance analysis based  on benchmark studies consisting of tests and
              measurements done in  heterogeneous wide area network (MBone/Internet/ATM)
              scenarios; and  4) in collaboration with researchers at UC Berkeley and local 
              industries, investigating integrating PET systems into specific  applications
              such as MPEG-2.  ***
