Abstract    :
              9416889  Peterson    This project proposes analysis of data from bottom pressure
              gauges  deployed across chokepoints for the Southern ocean flow.  The 
              deployment of the instruments was funded under a previous grant.   Bottom
              pressure gauges were deployed between South Africa and the  Antarctic coast
              close to the Greenwich Meridian and at two  locations spanning the Antarctic
              Circumpolar Current (ACC) south of  Tasmania.  Simultaneously, the British
              deployed similar instruments  in the drake Passage.  The main scientific goal
              of these  deployments was to determine the fluctuations in transport of the 
              Antarctic Circumpolar Current, relate it to those in the  subtropical and
              subpolar gyres and to the wind field over the  southern oceans.
