Abstract    :
              9416393  Wyllie  Current code provisions for structural walls with openings 
              result in substantial reinforcing requirements for both new  construction and
              the retrofit of existing construction.  In  the case of retrofit, the upgrade
              cost is typically close to  or exceeds the building replacement cost.  Existing
               buildings are commonly demolished and replaced with a  building incorporating
              a potentially less reliable lateral  forced resisting system.    The objective
              of this project is to develop performance-  based retrofit guidelines.  A
              focused research project is  conducted to identify appropriate analysis and
              design  methodologies for both new and existing construction.    The Northridge
              Earthquake provides an excellent opportunity  to study the performance of
              "older" reinforced concrete  buildings constructed with perforated shear walls.
               The  primary effort of the research will be to compare expected  versus
              observed building performance and to assess current  retrofit strategies of
              buildings utilizing perforated  reinforced concrete (RC) shear walls for
              lateral load  resistance.  The results of the research have the potential  to
              significantly impact the development of design guidelines  for RC perforated
              shear walls.    The project team for this research project combines the 
              talents of  "research" and "practicing" engineers.  This  collaborative effort
              will enable the project to encompass  the broad spectrum of design and retrofit
              issues associated  with perforated shear walls necessary to assess the current 
              state-of-the-practice as well as future research needs.    This is a Northridge
              Earthquake project.  ***
