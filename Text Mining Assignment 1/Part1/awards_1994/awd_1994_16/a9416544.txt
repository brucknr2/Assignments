Abstract    :
              9416544       The award is for research to develop a novel manufacturing 
              process for producing spherical metal particles of uniform  diameter,
              composition, and microstructure.  Available techniques of  producing metal
              particles either do not produce particles of  uniform size or, if they do,
              offer a narrow range of particles size  for a given apparatus.  A
              time-invariant axial magnetic field of  moderate intensity will be used to
              stabilize a liquid metal jet  issuing from a nozzle.  To destabilize this jet,
              a time-varying  intense magnetic field will be applied transverse to the jet
              axis,  pinching the droplets at uniform time intervals.  The droplets will  be
              allowed to spheroidize and solidify resulting in particles of  uniform shape,
              composition, and microstructure.  A benchtop-type  experimental verification of
              the process is proposed, along with  development of a simple model of the
              process.       the ability to produce uniform metal particles would benefit  a
              variety of applications that require uniformity of properties at  the
              micro-scale.  These includes rolling elements for miniature  instrument ball
              bearings, thin uniform corrosion and oxidation  prevention coatings, and
              microsievers, filters, and porous bearings  of well-controlled porosity.
