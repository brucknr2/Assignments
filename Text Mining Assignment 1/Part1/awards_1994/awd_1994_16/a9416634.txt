Abstract    :
              9416634  Bronk    The dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) pool is emerging as a 
              dynamic component of marine nitrogen cycles.  Though DON can  represent the
              largest pool of fixed nitrogen in marine  systems, the lack of suitable methods
              has kept information  on its utilization largely limited to a few individual 
              organic compounds such as amino acids or urea.  Despite the  lack of knowledge
              on utilization of the bulk of the  undefined DON pool, bacteria are considered
              the primary  users of DON in marine systems (with the exception of urea). 
              Recent work in phytoplankton enzymology, however, suggests  this assumption
              needs to be reevaluated.  Some phytoplankton  are now known to posses cell
              surface oxidases which allow  them to cleave amino groups from amino acids,
              primary  amines, and potentially other organic compounds.  The  phytoplankton
              known to posses these oxidases are smaller  autotrophs which could potentially
              be included in the  "bacterial" size fraction in traditional size fractionation
               experiments.    This Row Planning Grant project will combine the powerful 
              tools of flow cytometry and newly developed 15N tracer  techniques to
              discriminate autotrophic from heterotrophic  uptake of DON.  The objectives of
              this Planning Grant are to  (1)  refine existing cell sorting techniques for
              separating  autotrophs from heterotrophs in large enough numbers to  allow the
              measurement of 15N atom % enrichments and thus  allow the measurement of DON
              uptake rates by autotrophs, and  (2) to obtain preliminary data on uptake of
              DON by  autotrophs in the Eastern Tropical North Pacific to be used  in support
              of a full scale NSF proposal.  ***
