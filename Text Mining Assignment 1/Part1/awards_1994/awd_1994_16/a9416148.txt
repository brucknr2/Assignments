Abstract    :
              9416148  Goltz    This research is to study the impact of real-time seismic 
              information on the response and recovery activities of government  agencies,
              utilities and large corporations in the 1994 Northridge  earthquake.  The major
              objectives of this study will be to review  the performance of programs which
              provide real-time seismic data,  examine the intended and actual utilization of
              this information in  the earthquake and to identify improved methods of
              information  delivery and application as well as data requirements.  Focused 
              interviews with real-time information providers and recipients will  constitute
              the main form of data collection; review of written  pans, directives, issues
              papers and other documentary evidence will  be a secondary source of data for
              this study.  This project is a  contribution to the National Earthquake Hazard
              Reduction Program  and is supported by the Northridge Earthquake Emergency 
              Appropriation.  ***
