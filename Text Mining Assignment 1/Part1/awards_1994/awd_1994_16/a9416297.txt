Abstract    :
              9416297  Dixon    This project connects two North Texas institutions to the
              Internet  over 56kbps lines.  They are Texas Wesleyan University and the 
              Dallas Education Center.  Faculty and students at the schools  benefit from
              access to the resources of the Internet, including  libraries and
              supercomputers.  In addition, they are able to  communicate and collaborate
              with colleagues at other institutions  in pursuit of research and educational
              projects.  The award  provides partial support of the project for two years.
