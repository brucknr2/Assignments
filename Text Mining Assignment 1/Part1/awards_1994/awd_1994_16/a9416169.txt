Abstract    :
              9416169  Arango  The objective of this project is to study the conditions that 
              resulted in the liquefaction, or lack of liquefaction, of several  identified
              old-age sand deposits in the area affected by the  Northridge earthquake, and
              to relate the data gathered to that  obtained from other old deposits.  The
              motivation is to determine  more accurately the liquefaction resistance of old
              sand deposits:  Liquefaction resistance tends to increase with age, but this 
              increase appears to be under-estimated by current design  procedures, leading
              to overly conservative designs.    The project consists of the following: field
              investigations  (sampling and penetration resistance testing); laboratory tests
               (grain size, plasticity, microscopic classification, cyclic  strength); and
              analysis of the data.  ***
