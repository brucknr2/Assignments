Abstract    :
              9416088  HONEYMAN         Conventional wisdom has held that thorium reacts with
              all non-  aqueous phase ligands (i.e., macroparticles and colloids) to the 
              same degree with thorium distribution among those ligands being  proportional
              to ligand concentration.  There is, however, emerging  evidence that thorium
              reacts differently with the various compo-    nents of the "particle" pool. 
              This evidence suggests that thorium  may be highly fractionated within the pool
              of marine  colloidal  material (COM) and, thus, has a complicated path through
              the res-   ervior of COM.  For example, recent work points to a puzzling 
              aspect of marine colloid behavior: colloid turnover times estimated  from
              U-238/Th-234 disequilibrium are relatively short for all  molecular weight
              fractions: several weeks or less depending on the  environment; in contrast,
              14C data yields old apparent ages for low  molecular weight colloids and modern
              ages for the higher MW  fractions (Santschi et al., 1994).  Understanding the
              chemical  relationship between thorium and components of COM should provide 
              access to thorium as a tracer for components within the carbon  cycle.
