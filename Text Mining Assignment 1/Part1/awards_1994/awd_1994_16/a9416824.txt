Abstract    :
                 9416824  Harrell    This is a proposal for partial support for a joint
              seminar with  scholars from the People's Republic of China.  The seminar 
              organizers are Steven Harrell, University of Washington, and Wu  Jingzhong,
              Sichuan Provincial Research Institute for Minority  Affairs.  The topic is the
              relationship between the Yi peoples of  Southwest China, a group numbering over
              six million, but little  known in the West, and their Han, Tibetan, and other
              neighbors.   Five Chinese, one American, and one Australian scholar have been 
              invited to prepare papers, which will be distributed in advance  and discussed
              at the seminar, which will be held on the  University of Washington campus from
              March 19-22, 1995.   In  addition to making scholarship on the Yi accessible to
              the  Western anthropological community, this seminar will also serve  to
              intensify the dialogue between Western anthropology and  Chinese ethnology,
              disciplines with a similar substantive focus  but widely differing
              methodological assumptions.  After the  seminar, revised  versions of the
              papers are expected to be  published in English in the U.S. and in Chinese in
              China.
