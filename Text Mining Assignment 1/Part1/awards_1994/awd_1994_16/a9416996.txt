Abstract    :
              The ARGO II fiber-optic near-bottom optical-acoustic system will be  used to
              survey the narrow axial zone of the ultrafast spreading  East Pacific Rise at
              17 degrees south.  The purpose is to test the  hypothesis that along-strike
              thermal gradients set up the segmented  pattern of magma supply exert primary
              control on the distribution  and types of hydrothermal vents and vent biota, as
              well as on  varioation in fine-scale volcanotectonic characteristics along the 
              axial zone.
