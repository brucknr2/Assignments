Abstract    :
              Eastman  9416870  This research centers on the evaluation of organismal 
              diversification in Antarctic fishes of the perciform suborder  Notothenioidei. 
              Notothenioids are the dominant fishes by number  and biomass in all inner shelf
              areas of the Southern Ocean.  They  are an evolutionary novelty - the only
              known example of a fish  species flock in a marine habitat.  Although derived
              from a  benthic stock lacking swim bladders, notothenioids have  diversified
              into most water column habitats.  Nototheniods  display the wide scope of
              organismal diversification in an  ecosystem historically underutilized by
              non-notothenioid fishes,  and they are a striking example of the nature of
              Antarctic marine  biodiversity.  Primary objectives of this study are:  (1) to 
              evaluate organismal diversification with emphasis on neutral  buoyancy, reduced
              density (compared to the pleisomorphic benthic  condition) and the associated
              morphology in members of the  families Nototheniidae, Channichthyidae and
              Bathydraconidae; (2)  to explore the evolution of neutral buoyancy and reduced
              density  by mapping these and other morphological features on cladograms 
              independently derived from other information; (3) to determine  whether the
              diversification of buoyancy (life history) types and  the associated morphology
              are reflective of the phylogenetic  history of various notothenioid clades or
              are related to  environmental adaptation and (4) to add new buoyancy and 
              morphological information to the existing suites of characters  available for
              phylogenetic analysis of notothenioids.  In  addition to elucidating the
              morphological basis for evolutionary  changes in buoyancy, this study will
              provide insight into how  notothenioids diversified to occupy a variety of
              water column  habitats in the Southern Ocean.
