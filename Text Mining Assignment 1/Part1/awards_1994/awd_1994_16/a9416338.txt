Abstract    :
              9416338  Bock    This project will investigate the time series of positions from
              the Permanent Global Positioning  System (GPS) Geodetic Array prior to and
              after the Northridge earthquake of January 17, 1994  focussing on the anomalous
              strain events detected at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Ranchos  Palos
              Verdes sites several months before the earthquake.  The signals will be
              analyzed by data  stacking procedures to see if they are real indicators of
              anomalous strain variations or artifacts  of the initial analysis.  If real,
              these signals may be preseismic indicators and this will be tested  by
              comparison with other available data and earthquake models.  In addition,
              improved  techniques will be developed for densification and rapid response of
              GPS measurements in the  San Fernando Valley and Los Angeles Basin.  The
              results of this study will have major  implications for earthquake hazards
              mitigation using space geodetic techniques in blind thrust  environments such
              as the San Fernando Valley and Los Angeles Basin.
