Abstract    :
              Abstract    CTS -- 9416689       The Principal Investigator will construct and
              test an improved superfluid Stirling refrigerator for attaining temperatures of
              less than 300 mK (that is, less than one Kelvin in absolute temperature.). The
              refrigerator will use a mixture of  3He and 4He as the working fluid in a
              reverse Stirling cycle. The results of the test program will be used to improve
              modeling of the refrigerator, and to gain further understanding of the behavior
              and interaction of the 4He solvent and the 3He "gas" at the temperatures of
              refrigerator operation.   This type of refrigerator has the potential to
              replace other methods of attaining temperatures in the proposed range
              (dilution, 3He refrigerators, and demagnetization) because it is more energy
              efficient, does not require sealed pumps, does not depend on intense magnetic
              fields, and can operate in a zero-g environment.
