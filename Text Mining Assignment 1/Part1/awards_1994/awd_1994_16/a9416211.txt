Abstract    :
              This award supports a US contribution to a collaborative project  with Swedish
              geologists to evaluate the geochronology of the  Richarddalen Group of
              northwestern Svalbard.  These rocks have  recently yielded "Pan African" aged
              zircons (620-660 million years  old) that are enigmatic because there is little
              other evidence in  the Arctic or Scandinavian Caledonides to rock-forming or 
              metamorphic/deformational events of this age.  Detailed  geochronologic studies
              based on field and micro-structural study,  and high-precision U-Pb methods
              will be used to directly date  metamorphic and deformational fabrics. 
              Lead-207/Lead-206 ages will  be measured by direct evaporation of single zircon
              grains to test  for the presence of older (inherited) components, thereby
              further  constraining the interpretation of existing zircon ages.  These new 
              data will permit a direct assessment of whether the isotopic ages  reflect
              protolith, metamorphic or deformational, or mixed ages, and  the significance
              of these rocks to global tectonic reconstructions  in the Neoproterozoic.
