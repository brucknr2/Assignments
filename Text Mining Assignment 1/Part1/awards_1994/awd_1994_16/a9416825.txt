Abstract    :
              9416825  Altan       This workshop addresses German practices in design and 
              manufacturing related to technical education, training and  technology
              interchange.  The attendees will present, review,  debate, and summarize the
              principles which are thought to underlie  the perceived success of the German
              system and relate these  principles to the education system in the United
              States.   Recommendations will be made for educational institutions, 
              government agencies, and industry.       The purpose of the workshop is to
              contribute to the  acceleration of education and training related to design and
               manufacturing.  It is intended to provide the opportunity for the  United
              States to learn from the German experience and to cause  thoughtful
              consideration of related approaches in the United  States.
