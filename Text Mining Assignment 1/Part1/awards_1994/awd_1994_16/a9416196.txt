Abstract    :
              9416196  Stallings  This project is being funded as part of the National
              Earthquake  Hazards Reduction Program's investigation into the causes and 
              effects of the January 17, 1994 earthquake.  The project will  identify a
              purposive sample of neighborhoods which experienced  concentrated damage from
              the earthquake and explore the process  of recovery by examining existing data
              on damaged structures and  conducting personal interviews with both probability
              and  nonprobability samples of key participants in the recovery  process
              including tenants, apartment and commercial building  owners, housing
              officials, and officials from relevant federal  agencies.  The study will
              contribute to a better understanding of  the revival of urban neighborhoods
              following a major urban  disaster and suggest how federal and other government
              disaster  recovery and mitigation policies might be rewritten to facilitate 
              the retention of extensively damaged neighborhoods by removing  the unintended
              consequences accompanying policy implementation.  ***
