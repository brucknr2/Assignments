                                          ABSTRACT    AST-9416745    This   award   provides 
              travel  funds  (air  fares   only)   for  approximately  20  U.S.  scientists 
              to  attend  the  17th  Texas  Symposium  on  Relativistic Astrophysics to be 
              held  in  Munich,  Germany, on December 12-16, 1994.  The Texas Symposia take 
              place  every  other year and serve as an international summary of recent 
              developments   at  the  interface  of  astrophysics,   cosmology,  relativity,
              and particle astrophysics.  The biannual meetings are  held in different cities
              in the U.S., and every third (or second)  meeting is held in a foreign country.
               The meeting is open to all  qualified scientists.  ***
