Abstract    :
              9416602  COLLIER    This study will make use of a new analytical technique,
              Laser  Ablation of solids, integrated with an Inductively-Coupled Plasma  Mass
              Spectrometer (LA-ICP-MS) to determine high-resolution profiles   of a group of
              trace elements in the hydrous iron oxide phases of  ferromanganese deposits. 
              Target samples range from slowly  accumulating hydrogenous crusts to rapidly
              accumulating  hydrothermal crusts and shallow-water nodules with the goal to 
              study the paleochemistry of V, Mo and other minor/trace elements  present in
              seawater as oxyanions (including P, U, As, Se, Cr, and  others). Although the
              concentration of these elements in the crust  may be complicated by a variety
              of factors it is hypothesized that  the ratios between various oxyanions
              scavenged by the iron oxide  phases can be related to their paleo-ratios in
              seawater and  possibly to environmental conditions at the time of deposition.  
              The determination of other elements, including REEs and 232Th, will  aid in the
              interpretation of crust chemistry.  230Th will be  determined in the younger
              portions of rapidly-formed samples in  order to refine chronologies. The high
              sensitivity of the ICP-MS,  coupled with the sampling resolution of laser
              ablation  (approximately 50 um) contribute to the long-term goal of 
              significantly improving the utility of ferromanganese crusts for  
              paleoceanographic studies.
