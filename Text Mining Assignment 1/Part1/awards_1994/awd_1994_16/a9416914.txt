Abstract    :
              9416914  Thomson    This award supports a two-year cooperative research project 
              between Dr. James Thomson of the State University of New  York at Stonybrook
              and Professor Izumi Washitani  of the  University of Tsukuba.  This project
              represents a  collaboration of a Japanese botanist and an American bee 
              ecologist to investigate the reproductive failure of a  native Japanese plant,
              the primrose Primula seiboldii.  This  plant experiences seed-set failure in an
              urban reserve north  of Tokyo and a variety of evidence suggests that this is 
              because native bumble bees have disappeared from the area.  The first,
              fundamental aspect of the this project is to  extend this evidence and then
              test the hypothesis rigorously  by temporarily bringing bumble bee colonies to
              the reserve.  The second, applied aspect involves re-establishing a self- 
              sustaining population of bumble bees and preparing a  management plan.    The
              proposal brings together research  scientists from two  countries working in
              the area of ecosystem studies and  conservation biology.  The U.S. scientist
              will have the  opportunity to become familiar with researchers and research 
              practices at the University of Tsukuba.  Therefore, this  proposal fuldills the
              objectives of the Program in its  exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge
              through an  international collaboration.  ***
