Abstract    :
              The nonlinear dynamics of equatorially trapped waves and their interactions with
              complicated topography and basin boundaries will be studied in the laboratory.
              The new experimental technique utilizes the magnetic body force of ferrofluids
              to achieve the full spherical geometry of geophysical flows.  A complementary
              finite-difference numerical model of shallow water waves on a sphere will be
              used to aid in interpreting the laboratory results.
