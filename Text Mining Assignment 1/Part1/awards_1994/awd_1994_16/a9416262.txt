Abstract    :
              9416262  Bennett  Construction with masonry infills remains very popular, 
              particularly in the low to moderate seismic zones of the  eastern/central
              United States.  Infill walls may have both  beneficial and detrimental affects
              on the building behavior under  seismic loading.  Infill walls increase the
              stiffness of a  building, shift the structure's center of stiffness, and affect
               the forces in the framing possible causing premature failure of  frame
              members.  The infills can also provide a redundant load  path for both
              horizontal and vertical loads, thus have a positive  influence on the
              structural behavior.    The objective of this project is to use data from the
              Northridge  earthquake to characterize the beneficial and detrimental 
              performance of infills, correlate the performance to numerical  methods, and
              evaluate the risk associated with both unreinforced  and reinforced infills.   
              Key aspects of in-plane performance of infills that will be  examined are the
              details of the interface between the infill and  bounding frame, the alignment
              of the infill with the bounding  frame, and the effect of the infill on the
              bounding frame.  With  respect to out-of-plane behavior, the stability of the
              panel and  applicability of arching theories under dynamic load will be 
              examined.    This research will impact both high and moderate seismic zones. 
              The level and priority of retrofit required for infills in high  hazard zones
              may be less than anticipated.  Perhaps just as  significant is the impact on
              infill construction in low to  moderate seismic zones, which cover most of the
              central/eastern  Untied States.  A better understanding of infills, which has
              to  be related to actual seismic performance, is needed to take full  advantage
              of infill construction in moderate hazard seismic  zones.  ***
