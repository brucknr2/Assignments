Abstract    :
              Namson  9416191  This study will produce 11 balanced, restorable, cross sections
               across the Santa Susana Mountains anticlinorium and a series of  subsurface
              structure maps for the same area.  The sections will be  restored to about 3
              Ma, or the approximate time of initiation of  significant convergence in the
              region.  The sections will permit  calculation of the convergence rates across
              the anticlinorium, and  the amount of slip and slip rates of hidden thrusts. 
              They will  also permit the generation of structure maps on fault surfaces, top 
              of basement and tops of Tertiary formations, which in turn will  permit the
              building of a three-dimensional picture of the  Northridge region.  The results
              of this study will greatly assist  understanding of the subsurface structures
              of the Los Angeles and  San Fernando Valleys, and provide much-needed
              geometrical and  kinematic constraints for seismic hazard interpretations.  ***
