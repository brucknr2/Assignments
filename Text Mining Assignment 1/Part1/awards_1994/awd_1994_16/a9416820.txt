Abstract    :
              9416820  Greenland    The investigators will perform a comparative
              climatological analysis of the LTER sites.  The intersite analysis will include
              four items:    1. a systematic time series analysis of temperature and
              precipitation records of all 19 LTER sites using the same methodology for each
              site;    2. a compilation of projected climate change scenarios from a range of
              climate model experiments interpolated to LTER sites and regions and a
              discussion of  uncertainties associated with these projections;    3.
              descriptions of the climate and water budget of the LTER sites;    4. a
              comparative analysis of the climate of all 19 sites, including analyses of
              regional climates for the sites.    The analysis will be published as an
              electronic book by means of the LTER Network   MOSAIC information system as
              well as an LTER Network paper and will also be   submitted for publication in
              peer reviewed journals.
