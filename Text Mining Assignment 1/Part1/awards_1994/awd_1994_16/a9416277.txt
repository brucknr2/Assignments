Abstract    :
              9416277  Olson  This  project is being funded as part of the National 
              Earthquake Hazards  Reduction Program's investigation into  the  causes  and
              effects  of  the  January  17, 1994  Northridge  earthquake.  The earthquake
              provides a unique  opportunity to evaluate the complete or partial evacuation 
              of hospitals since several were affected by the event. This  project will:
              ascertain the level of evacuation preparedness  of hospitals in the area;
              identify the factors that promoted  or inhibited preparedness;  identify  the
              types of  problems that have been addressed by hospital earthquake  evacuation
              preparedness efforts and those problems that  need  to be  considered; and
              identify costeffective  approaches to improve hospital  earthquake evacuation 
              preparedness.  Data  will be  collected through on-site and telephone
              interviews.  ***
