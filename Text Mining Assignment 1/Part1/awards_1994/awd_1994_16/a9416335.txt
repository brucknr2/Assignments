Abstract    :
              9416335  Toro    This research is to produce local site earthquake response maps
               in the Los Angeles metropolitan area for use in microzonation, by  combining
              geological and geotechnical information with local  strong-motion data from the
              Northridge, Whittier and other  earthquakes.  Two different formulations of the
              empirical Bayes  updating will be developed, tested, and applied.  The
              empirical  formulation estimates a site term at each recording site by 
              comparing observed and predicted peak amplitudes; this formulation  is applied
              separately to each frequency or frequency band.  The  physical formulation uses
              the comparison between observed and  predicted peak amplitudes to extract
              information about the likely  values of physical site characteristics, i.e.
              velocity profile,  modulus and damping-degradation curves; this operation is
              applied  simultaneously at several frequencies or frequency bands.  Updated 
              estimates of site amplification are then generated.  This project  is a
              contribution to the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction  Program and is
              supported by the Northridge Earthquake Emergency  Appropriation.  ***
