Abstract    :
              Funds are provided to sponsor an open workshop to develop a  research plan for
              integrating studies of the Arctic Ocean  shelves with the Central Basin.   A
              goal of the Arctic  System Science (ARCSS) Ocean-Atmosphere-Ice Interactions 
              (OAII) global change research program is to foster the  integration of various
              disciplines into cooperative research  efforts that are relevant to
              understanding the effects of  global change.  Research has demonstrated the
              importance of  determining Arctic continental shelf/ocean basin  interactions
              and the cycling of biogenic materials at the  sediment/water interface of
              Arctic continental shelves and  slopes.  The workshop will provide a forum for
              interested  scientists to discuss and develop a prioritized science plan 
              focusing on a biologically focused systems approach to  shelf/basin exchange in
              the Arctic.
