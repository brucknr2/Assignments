Abstract    :
              9416336  Agnew    This research is to develop and install 5 high-stability
              geodetic  monuments in a 15 station expansion of the GPS (Global Positioning 
              System) permanent network in southern California around the area of  the 1994
              Northridge earthquake.  The stability of unanchored  geodetic monuments is
              estimated to be the major factor in the  quality of data from this network at
              some sites.  This work will  enable the study of the stability of 5 of the
              sites and produce  plans that well enable future construction to be contracted
              to  external sources.  Major funding for the array expansion is to come  from
              NASA, USGS, and the Southern California Earthquake Center in  addition to this
              grant.  This project is a contribution to the  National Earthquake Hazard
              Reduction Program and is supported by  the Northridge Earthquake Emergency
              Appropriation.  ***
