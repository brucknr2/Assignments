Abstract    :
              9416631  Holbrook    A joint US-Danish study of the Southeast Greenland margin
              to  provide a better understanding of the volcanic rifted continental  margins
              which contain great thicknesses of mafic igneous material  emplaced during
              continental breakup.  This is an ideal setting to  study volcanic rifted
              margins, because of a known hotspot and well  defined hot spot track, a
              relatively simple tectonic and geologic  history and a thin postrift sediment
              cover.  Recent ODP drilling  and numerous existing field studies provide
              additional background  data.  A multichannel and wide-angle seismic study in
              planned with  the objectives to determine the influence of a mantle plume on
              the  rifted margin magmatism, the detailed structure of the continent-  ocean
              transition, and to compare the crustal structure of conjugate  volcanic margin
              segments. The data will provide a framework for  interpreting geological and
              drilling results on the margin and for  constraining thermomechanical models of
              volcanic rifted margin  evolution.
