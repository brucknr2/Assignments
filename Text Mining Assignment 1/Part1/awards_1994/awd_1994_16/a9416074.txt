Abstract    :
              9416074  Houghton    The objective of this study is to investigate the flow of
              the  bottom boundary   layer (BBL) in the vicinity of the shelfbreak front in
              the Middle  Atlantic Bight   using a novel technique (a dye as a Lagrangian
              follower) in order  to resolve   the small scale flow near the moving frontal
              boundary. One of the  goals of   the study is unambiguously confirm the
              existence of a mean  Lagrangian   flow offshore of the BBL and its convergence
              at the frontal  boundary. These   results will be importnat ina dvancing our
              understanding of the  dynamics   controlling exchange of shelf and slope water
              at the continental  margin and   the circulation responsible for enhanced
              biological productivity at  the   shelfbreak.
