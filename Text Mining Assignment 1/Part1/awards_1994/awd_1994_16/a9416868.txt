Abstract    :
              9416868  Webster       This is a proposal by two faculty members at Vanderbilt 
              University to do a very high statistics study of charm  mesons in the wide band
              fixed target beam at Fermilab.  They  are finishing the analysis of two
              experiments which took  data in 1990-91 and are part of the E831 collaboration
              which  is building the apparatus to take date in 1996-97.  They  anticipate
              over one million reconstruct decays of charm  mesons from which they will
              measure the form factors,  lifetimes and find or set new limits on CP violation
              in D+  decays.  Vanderbilt has a lead role in building a new inner  muon
              detector system.  ***
