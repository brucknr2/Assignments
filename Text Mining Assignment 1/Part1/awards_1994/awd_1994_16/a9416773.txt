Abstract    :
              9416773  Okaya    This project will acquire, reprocess and interpret 60-200
              miles of recent industry seismic  reflection data from the epicentral region of
              the January 17, 1994 Northridge earthquake.  The  data will be used to provide
              constraints on geologic models of the Northridge earthquake source  zone and to
              study the geometry of faulting in the epicentral region.  The results will be 
              integrated with seismic refraction data collected as part of the Los Angeles
              Region Seismic  Experiment through out the Northridge epicenter.  The data,
              which was collected using Vibroseis  sources, will be provided by Chevron and
              at least three other companies.  This study is being  adopted by the American
              Geophysical Institute as one of their first pilot projects to archive and  make
              public data that are no longer of commercial interest but that have societal
              and/or scientific  relevance.  The results will provide images of the causal
              fault for the Northridge earthquake,  possible mid-crustal detachment surfaces
              and the Moho, and will thus provide important  constraints for all mechanical
              and kinematic models of the region.
