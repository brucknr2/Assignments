Abstract    :
                This three-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative research in
              polymers and biophysics and involves Sergei Obukhov of the University of
              Florida, Michael Rubinstein of Kodak and Jean-Louis Viovy of the Ecole
              Superieure for Industrial Physics and Chemistry, Paris, France.  They propose a
              study of DNA gel electrophoresis, which is the basic method for DNA separation.
               The objectives of their research are (1)  to develop a detailed understanding
              of the structure of a DNA molecule moving through a gel in a strong electric
              field; and (2) to improve separation techniques of long chain DNA molecules. 
              They will work on a set of analytical and closely related numerical models
              which allow simulation of the motion of ultra large DNA molecules.  The models
              will be tested against other numerical models and experiments developed by the
              French investigators.  The U.S. investigators bring to this collaboration
              considerable expertise in polymer theory and physics.  This is complemented by
              Dr. Viovy's expertise in molecular modeling and the experiments in DNA
              electrophoresis currently in progress in Paris. Their research addresses the
              ultimate goal of improving the accuracy and efficiency of current DNA
              separation techniques. These improved techniques are essential for mapping the
              `human genome` and for advancements in molecular biology and bioengineering.
