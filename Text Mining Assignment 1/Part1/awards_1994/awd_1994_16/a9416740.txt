Abstract    :
              9416740  KIRCHMAN      Large numbers of colloids (submicron particles) have been
              observed  in the ocean and are thought to play key roles in several 
              geochemical reactions. Preliminary experiments have led to the  hypothesis that
              colloids are crucial in the production of semi-  refractory dissolved organic
              matter (DOM) with turnover times  between truly labile compounds (e.g. free
              amino acids) and  refractory DOM with turnover times >1000 years.  Specifically
              it is  hypothesized that compounds associated with colloids are degraded 
              slower than the same compound freely dissolved. Experiments will be  conducted
              to test this hypothesis and to gain more information  about turnover of
              naturally-occurring submicron particles.  These  experiments will examine: 1)
              degradation of 3H-protein sorbed to or  trapped inside 14C-liposomes which
              mimic colloids produced by  flagellates (flagellate fecal pellets); 2)
              degradation of 3H-  protein sorbed to or trapped inside 14C-liposomes which
              mimic  colloids produced by flagellates (flagellate fecal pellets); and   2)
              degradation of protein adsorbed to natural colloids. Turnover of  colloids will
              be estimated from the degradation of dual  radiolabeled liposomes and from
              14C-labeled flagellate fecal  pellets.  These experiments will be conducted in
              the Delaware  Estuary and coastal waters during the spring bloom and summer, 
              which should give a range of colloid types, concentrations and  degradation
              rates.  The work should provide insight into colloid  turnover, the degradation
              of DOM in oceanic environments, and  perphaps processes leading to the
              formation of truly refractory  DOM.
