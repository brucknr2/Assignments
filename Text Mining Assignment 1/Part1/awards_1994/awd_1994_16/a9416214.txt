Abstract    :
              9416214  Archuleta    This research involves the inversion of strong motion 
              accelerograms using empirical Green's functions to determine the  source
              mechanism of the Northridge earthquake.  The data to be used  include specially
              installed digital instruments at existing  accelerometer sites.  Although
              empirical Green's functions have  been used in earlier studies, they have been
              limited by a lack of  station distribution.  The data here represent the best
              combination  ever of station distribution and large aftershocks recorded from 
              the hypocentral region of a large main shock.  This project is a  contribution
              to the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program  and is supported by the
              Northridge Earthquake Emergency  Appropriation.  ***
