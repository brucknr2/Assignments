Abstract    :
              9416761  Todorovska  This action is to support digitization of recordings of
              strong  ground motions by the Los Angeles and Vicinity Strong Motion  Network
              during the Northridge earthquake.    Of the 77 stations in the field at the
              time of this earthquake,  65 stations recorded complete strong motions from the
              main shock,  at epicentral distances between 2 km and 85 km.  Numerous 
              aftershocks were also recorded, several having magnitude M > 5.  These data are
              invaluable for better understanding of the rupture  process and of the damage
              in various areas, as well as for  understanding site effects and for forward
              modeling of ground  motion in areas where there were no other recordings.  ***
