Abstract    :
              9416939  Zumberge       The principal investigators will conduct a series of 
              vertical deformation measurements on the Juan de Fuca Ridge by  deploying a
              series of ocean-bottom benchmarks and measuring their  vertical positions using
              a recently developed ocean bottom  absolute gravity meter together with
              absolute pressure  measurements.  This work will be done in conjunction with 
              horizontal strain measurements and is expected to be a long-term  part of the
              RIDGE observatory effort on the Juan de Fuca Ridge.  ***
