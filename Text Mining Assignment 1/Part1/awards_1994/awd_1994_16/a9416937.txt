Abstract    :
              9416937  Sanford          This award is the starter grant increment of Dr.
              Sanford's   Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Chemistry award. The focus   of
              the research is the design and synthesis of substituted    1.1.1  propellanes
              and their polymerization to novel rigid-rod   polymers. Synthetic targets for
              the monomers will be   tri-substituted propellanes to enhance polymer
              solubility,    bridged propellanes to force regiospecificity, and spiro-linked 
               propellanes to make comb-shaped polymers or induce helical   polymer
              structure. Once made, the use of rigid-rod polymers in   self-assembling
              systems and as building blocks for   nanotechnology will be explored.    Apart
              from the intrinsic interest in propellane rigid-rod   polymers as novel
              materials, this award will provide synthetic   polymer experience to
              undergraduate students which should serve   them well either in graduate school
              or in industrial careers.
