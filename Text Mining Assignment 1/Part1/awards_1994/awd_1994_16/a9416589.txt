Abstract    :
              9416589  Hermans    This Americas Program award will  support a collaborative 
              research project between Dr. Jan Hermans, University of  North Carolina, Chapel
              Hill, and Dr. Francisco  Lara Ochoa,  Universidad Autonoma Nacional de Mexico,
              focusing on  complementary studies of loop structures in antibodies.  Methods
              for study of conformational stability of biological  macromolecules with
              molecular dynamics simulation will be  applied to problems of the
              conformational preferences of  hypervariable  loops of gamma globulins and
              related  molecules.  Calculations will be performed to assess the  relative
              free energies in solution for different conformers  of specificity  determining
              loops.    This research addresses two important scientific questions:  the
              relation between sequence and structure of  immunoglobulin loops and the
              problem of distinguishing  alternate conformations of proteins on the basis of 
              simulations.   Answers to these questions will have  important consequences for
              understanding the properties of  new immunoglobulin sequences, in the context
              of protein  engineering and disease, and would be a valuable final step  in
              theoretical studies of the so-called  protein folding  problem, which has been
              a central question in structural  biology for many years.  ***
