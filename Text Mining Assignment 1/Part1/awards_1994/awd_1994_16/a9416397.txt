              Process Analytical Chemistry at the  University of Washington and the other is
              a multi-university Center  for Design and Analog/Digital Integrated Circuits at
              Washington  State University, University of Washington, Oregon State University
               and State University of New York at Stoneybrook.    The evaluator is highly
              qualified to perform this study.    The Program Manager recommends Dr. Craig
              Scott be awarded $42,000  for three years for this project.
