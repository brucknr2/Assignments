Abstract    :
              Abstract   United Health Services Hospital - M. Donnelly   Connection to NSFNET 
              Proposal No. NCR-9416988  United Health Services Hospitals is a not-for-profit 
              organization, located in Upstate New York and composed of two,  community,
              teaching hospitals, an urgicenter, and five primary  care clinics.  UHSH
              fosters a strong primary care physician base  referring to medical and surgical
              specialties in an atmosphere of  commitment to education and research.   
              Through Internet, many clinicians, educators, researchers and  administrative
              personnel at UHSH will have global electronic  mail, immediate access to
              electronic publications, active  membership in discussion lists, on-line search
              from extensive  databases, instant transfer of files and software from remote 
              sources, and entry to network and remote computer services.   There is already
              an optical fiber connection between the two  hospitals.  There are plans for
              the parent company to implement a  similar connection for the Ideal Senior
              Living Center by the end  of 1994.      This will enable Internet access for
              three institutions.  This  proposal presents the significance of the connection
              to clinical  care, education and research at UHSH and shows the methodology 
              and hardware for making the connection effective.
