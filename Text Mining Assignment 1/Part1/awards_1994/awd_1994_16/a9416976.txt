Abstract    :
                                        ABSTRACT                                  9416976 
              PUETTER, R.C.         Recent work in image reconstruction using pixon based 
              techniques has led to the ability to remove point-spread-  function blurring of
              images.  Initial tests have suggested  that these new techniques can provide
              order-of-magnitude  improvements in photometric sensitivity and resolution. 
              These methods are now being introduced to the scientific  community and the
              merit of these methods are now being  recognized.  This project will carry out
              exploratory  research into pixon based methods making additional tests  and
              demonstrations of their potential.
