Abstract    :
              9316815  Lauenroth    Despite the considerable effort that has been devoted to
              understanding net primary production and decomposition in the past 30 years,
              there are still a number of outstanding and crucial questions for which there
              are not answers.  The purpose of this project is to answer several of these
              questions for temperate grasslands.  This project will comprise experimental
              and observational approaches to investigate the controls on aboveground net
              primary projection, decomposition, and net nitrogen mineralization at two
              temperate grassland sites, one in the United States and the other in Argentina.
               Both sites have long-term records of ecological investigations.  This work
              represents a continuation of a collaboration between the two research groups
              that began approximately a decade ago.
