Abstract    :
              9416384  Kelson    This study will map the locations and patterns of late
              Quaternary  surficial deformation related to buried, potentially seismogenic 
              sources in the northern San Fernando Valley.  An assessment  will be made of
              earthquake-related geomorphic features to see if  they can be used to delineate
              areas of potential seismic hazard on  public planning maps.  The distribution
              of potentially fault-  related geomorphic features will be mapped using a
              special  collection of 1930's aerial photographs, taken prior to  urbanization
              in the area, and vintage topographic maps.   Longitudinal stream profiles and
              channel pattern analyses will  assist in recognition of earthquake- related
              anticlinal  deformation.  1:24,000-scale maps will be produced of late 
              Quaternary deformation within the Oat Mountain, Van Nuys, San  Fernando and
              Canoga Park quadrangles. The results of this study  will yield information on
              the association of blind thrust faults  and geomorphic features, and will
              assist in devising methods to  depict such information on geologic and planning
              maps.  ***
