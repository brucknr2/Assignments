Abstract    :
              9416320  Magistrale    This research is to use 3-D computer simulations to
              investigate  the interaction of the 1994 Northridge, California, earthquake 
              source with the three-dimensional geologic structure of the San  Fernando
              Valley and surrounding region.  The project will be a  collaboration between
              San Diego State University and S-CUBED  Division of Maxwell Laboratories.  The
              San Fernando valley is an  extensive, low seismic velocity sedimentary basin. 
              A central  objective is to assess the role played by this geometry in 
              controlling the frequency content, duration, and intensity of  horizontal and
              vertical strong ground motions.  In order to draw  the correct engineering
              lessons from the earthquake, we need to  understand what characteristics of the
              ground motion arose from the  specifics of this event versus which
              characteristics of the ground  response are likely to be repeated in future
              earthquakes.  This  project is a contribution to the National Earthquake Hazard
               Reduction Program and is supported by the Northridge Earthquake  Emergency
              Appropriation.  ***
