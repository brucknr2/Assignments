Abstract    :
                      9416035  Sutton  The long-term objective of the proposed research is to
              identify  signal transduction components involved in plant response to 
              environmental stimuli.  Using the Xenopus oocyte/mRNA injection  system,
              research proposed will focus on signal transduction in  response to the
              environmental stimuli of low non-freezing  temperature and dehydration in
              higher plants.  A common effect of  these two stimuli on plants is to modulate
              endogenous abscisic acid  (ABA) levels, not all responses to low temperature
              are ABA  dependent.  The mode of action of ABA has not been conclusively 
              demonstrated.  Questions remain regarding actual location of ABA  receptors,
              and second messengers, if any, that are necessary for  signal transduction. 
              Research proposed will initially focus on  ABA, since there is evidence in the
              literature of ABA stimulating  Ca release.  Preliminary data from this lab
              suggests that ABA may  interact with plasma membrane receptors and cause an
              increase in  intracellular Ca.  Specific aims of this proposal are: 1) To 
              characterize the responses, to ABA and several ABA analogues, from  oocytes
              injected with tobacco mRNA. 2) If Ca is mobilized, to  localize its source in
              an attempt to determine the manner in which  ABA and its receptors are
              functioning.  If Ca is not mobilized, to  determine the alternative second
              messenger system being utilized by  ABA.  3) To utilize the Xenopus oocyte
              system to isolate and  characterize ABA receptors cDNA clones.  Knowing how ABA
              and  receptor(s) interact will help in understanding plant responses  common to
              the stimuli of low temperature and dehydration.  Research  proposed will
              involve the areas of electrophysiology, molecular  biology, biochemistry and
              cell biology.  The integrative nature of  this research will make it possible
              for research to be performed at  appropriate collaborative research
              laboratories and will prove to  be a rewarding and exciting environment for
              training of  postdoctoral associates and graduate students.  ** *
