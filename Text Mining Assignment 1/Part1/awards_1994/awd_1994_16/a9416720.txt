Abstract    :
                This two-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative research in physics
              between Roberto Mancini of the University of Nevada and Jean-Claude Gauthier of
              the Ecole Polytechnique's Laboratory for the Utilization of Intense Lasers.  
              The project combines complementary modeling and experimental work in the area
              of femtosecond laser-produced plasmas and in the generation of ultra short-
              X-ray pulses.  They will study the effects of time-dependent atomic kinetics
              and hot-electron production and attenuation.  The project brings together
              complementary resources.  The University of Nevada offers expertise in theory
              and modeling research in laser-produced plasmas.  This will be complemented by
              experimental work performed on a state-of-the-art laser facility at the Ecole
              Polytechnique.  The French research group will focus on experiments of
              irradiation of solid targets, diagnostics, complementary hydrodynamic modeling
              of target evolution, and Monte Carlo simulations of hot-electron transport. 
              Results from these experiments will drive kinetic models developed at the
              University of Nevada.  The project will advance understanding of dense plasma
              physics that will be beneficial to research in astrophysics, materials science,
              and studies on matter in extreme conditions.
