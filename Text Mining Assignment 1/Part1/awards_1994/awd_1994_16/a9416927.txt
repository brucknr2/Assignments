Abstract    :
              9416927  Shokurov    This award supports the participation of 10 U.S. 
              scientists in a U.S.-Japan seminar on the  Classification of Algebraic
              Varieties, to be held  at the Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore in  March
              1996.  The co-organizers are Dr. Vyacheslav  Shokurov of the Johns Hopkins
              University and  Professor Yujiro Kawamata of the University of  Tokyo. The
              seminar will focus on recent advances  in the Log Minimal Model Program and its
               applications to the classification of algebraic  varieties, in particular, log
              Fanos and Calabi-  Yaus.  Topics to be discussed include: vector  bundles,
              chern numbers, rational Riemann-Roch;  completions of log divisors and
              elephants;  logarithmic structures; and rigid spaces.    The seminar will
              foster the type of contact  between Japanese and U.S. scientists that can be 
              expected to have significant influence on the  future course of the field.  The
              proposed  participants and observers have been selected for  their past
              contributions and current activity in  the field and the meeting can be
              expected to  produce concrete plans for future cooperation and  exchange. 
              Therefore, this proposal fulfills the  objectives of the Program in its
              exchange and  transfer of scientific knowledge through an  international
              collaboration.  ***
