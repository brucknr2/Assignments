Abstract    :
              9416533  Holmes  It has been common practice in building seismic design to 
              assume part of the building resists all the seismic forces  and the remainder
              of the building resists only gravity  forces.  Though code provisions require
              the gravity load  carrying system to be designed to accommodate the imposed 
              lateral drifts, it is not clear that the procedures for  checking the imposed
              drifts are adequate, and it is not  certain that many engineers actually check
              the gravity  system for lateral drifts.  Several reinforced concrete (RC) 
              buildings designed in this way sustained damage and collapse  associated with
              failure of the so-called gravity columns  (the columns not designed to resist
              lateral forces).    This project is to develop improved understanding of the 
              factors leading to failure of RC gravity columns, as well as  to develop
              improved design approaches.  This need is  relevant to evaluation and upgrading
              of existing buildings,  and equally relevant to the design of new buildings. 
              The  research will address this need using analytical methods  based on
              experimental evidence, and will involve both  academic researchers and design
              professionals.    Specifically, the research tasks include:  (a) study of the 
              deformability of reinforced concrete columns; (b) study of  deformation demands
              imposed on columns by practical  procedures for design and evaluation; (d)
              transfer of  findings to relevant code/guidelines activities; (e)  coordination
              of other Northridge research projects that are  related to the ongoing NSF R/R
              program; and (f) contribution  to the professional papers series to be
              assembled by NEHRP  agencies, as well as other publications and professional 
              presentations.    This is a Northridge earthquake project.  ***
