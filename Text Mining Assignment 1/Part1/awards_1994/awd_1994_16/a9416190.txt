Abstract    :
              9416190  Rose  This  project is being funded as part of the National  Earthquake
               Hazards  Reduction Program's investigation into  the  causes  and  effects  of
               the  January 17, 1994 earthquake.   The  study  will  formulate,  apply, and
              validate a methodology for  analyzing  the  economic impacts of earthquakes. 
              The core of the model  will  be  an  input-output table of the Los Angeles
              Department of Water and  Power Service Area, as well as the surrounding region.
               The basic  I-O model will be able to estimate insurance payments and outside 
              aid.  The  model  will  be extended to disaggregate  the  impacts  according to
              income bracket and ethnic/racial category.  Finally,  a  linear programming
              reformulation of the model will be used  to  analyze  policies that can
              minimize the decrease in the  flow  of  goods  and  services  and  provide 
              insight  into  recovery   and  reconstruction policies.  ***
