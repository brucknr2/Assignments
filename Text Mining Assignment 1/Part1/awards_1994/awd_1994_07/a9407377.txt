Abstract    :
              9407377  Kilham  This research addresses one of the major concerns of the
              ecological agenda: the relationship of climate change to the structure,
              function and survival of ecological communities. The objectives of the study
              are (1) to characterize the physiological responses of the eight dominant
              diatom species from selected lakes of the Yellowstone National Park region to
              temperature, light, silicon, phosphorus, and nitrogen, (2)  to determine the
              relative competitive abilities of the species, and (3) to perform field studies
              on the abundances and relative competitive abilities of the species. A set of
              lacustrine sedimentary records, coupled with active and intense investigations
              on landscape, climatic and limnological changes underway in Yellowstone
              ecosystems, provides an unparalleled opportunity to incorporate resource
              competition theory with field observations on diatom assemblages, evolution and
              extinction. This study will integrate the predictions and results based on
              resource competition theory with observations with changes in the structure of
              diatom assemblages in the lakes of the Yellowstone Region to explain the
              present diatom distributions and to test the causal factors proposed to explain
              diatom distributions over the Holocene.   %%%  This research provides a strong
              causal linkage between limnology and process-oriented physiological ecology to
              acquire information necessary for a detailed interpretation of the paleorecord
              and a firm basis for developing landscape-level transfer functions that will
              lead to fine-scale climate reconstructions.
