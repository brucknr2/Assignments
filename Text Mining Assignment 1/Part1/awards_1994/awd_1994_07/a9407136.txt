Abstract    :
              9407136  Packard    An avian embryo obtains 100-150 mg of calcium from its
              calcareous  eggshell during the last half of development.  This remarkable 
              influx of calcium occurs with no observable perturbation to calcium  status, an
              observation that has led to the conclusion that his  influx of calcium must be
              under homeostatic control.  Embryos may  mediate the influx of calcium by
              controlling shell calcium  mobilization and/or the transport of calcium into
              the vasculature.   The mechanism and control of calcium transport during
              embryogenesis  have been examined extensively, but efforts to elucidate the 
              mechanism and control of shell calcium mobilization have been  unsuccessful, in
              part because of the complexity of the in vivo  system and the absence, until
              recently, of appropriate in vitro  protocols.  This research will use a new
              protocol for in vitro  culture of the calcium-mobilizing system to examine the
              mechanism  and control of shell calcium mobilization.  The mechanism of shell 
              calcium mobilization will be examined by exposing the calcium-  mobilizing
              system to inhibitors of two enzymes (carbonic anhydrase  and a proton ATPase)
              that are believed to be important mediators of  this process.  Control of shell
              calcium mobilization will be  examined by culturing the system with a variety
              of calcium-  regulating hormones that have the potential to stimulate or
              inhibit  the removal of calcium from the eggshell.  This research will  answer
              fundamental questions about how embryos maintain calcium  homeostasis during a
              period of intense calcium influx, in isolation  from the control systems of the
              maternal parent, and when their own  control systems are developing and
              differentiating.  ***
