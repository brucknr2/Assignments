Abstract    :
                This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              will help the  Department of Chemistry at the University of California--Santa
              Barbara acquire an upgrade of  an existing 500 MHz spectrometer which will be
              used in research.  The research activity to be  supported include:  studies of
              the development of sequence specific catalysts for the  hydrolysis of
              dialkyl-phosphate linkages in DNA and RNA, the synthesis and study of  mimics
              of heme-containing enzymes, the characterization of siderophores and other
              metal-  containing compounds produced by marine bacteria, synthesis of new
              materials that have  high therapeutic potential, and the elucidation of the
              structure and dynamics of proteins  and other structures of biological
              importance.    Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is the most
              powerful tool available to  the  chemist for the elucidation of the structure
              of molecules.  It is used to identify  unknown  substances, characterize
              specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to  study the  dynamics of
              interactions between molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art  NMR 
              spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. 
              The  results from  these NMR studies are useful in areas such as polymers and
              catalysis, and in  biology.
