Abstract    :
              9407217  Stevens   The relationship between DNA at the molecular level and the
              expression of the developmental abnormality will be examined using the fruit
              fly Drosphila mercatorum as a model system.  In recent years molecular
              techniques have been developed facilitating the molecular mapping genes that
              control particular traits.  The PI proposes to apply these techniques to the
              abnormal abdomen syndrome in D. mercatorum.  For the past 20 years, scientists
              have been studying the genetics of D. mercatorum, thus this system allows the
              PI to investigate the genetic basis of a developmental abnormality.  In the
              past 10 years, the research has focused on identifying the genes involved in
              this abnormality and understanding the effect of this abnormality on affected
              individuals.  The developmental abnormality is controlled by two genes, with
              modifiers on the other chromosomes.  Experiments have demonstrated that the
              abnormality is modified by several genes scattered throughout the genome.  That
              is, the trait is affected by many genes.   The PI's goal is to identify
              modifiers of these major genes.  For example, we know the major genes for
              diabetes; however, the expression of this trait seems to depend on other genes.
               It is likely that different genes in different people affect the expression of
              diabetes.  This project is analogous to identifying the other genes.  The PI
              will determine if the same or different genes in different flies affect the
              abnormality.  The PI will look for differences within and between populations.
