Abstract    :
                     Current available testing methodologies have not been widely  or
              productively utilized in industry for several reasons, including such factors 
              as deadline pressures, necessity of a large initial investment in software and 
              hardware, impracticality of methodologies, or inability to work with embedded 
              systems.  This project addresses one testing issue which has been  problematic
              for industry:  embedded systems.    The inherent  multiprocessing in embedded
              systems makes them particularly difficult to  test.  For example, each
              instrument control and display may be implemented as  its own thread of
              execution.  Testing all possible interleavings quickly results  in a
              combinatorial explosion.  Code complexity directly contributes to these 
              combinatorics.  One approach for handling complexity is through abstraction. 
              This research seeks to develop a testing strategy based on state pools and
              constraints.  Contraints represent relationships that must be  maintained
              between objects.  By treating these relationships as atomic units,  execution
              granularity can be increased, reducing the number of interleaved execution 
              paths.  With the cooperation of an industry partner, application to production
              systems is being explored.
