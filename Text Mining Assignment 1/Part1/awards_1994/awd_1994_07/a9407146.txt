Abstract    :
              This proposal involves the study of equilibrium and non-  equilibrium properties
              of nuclear matter, with applications  to heavy-ion reactions, the effective
              nucleon-nucleon  interaction in nuclear matter, and the nuclear equation of 
              state.  The research will employ the quantum mechanical  Green function
              formalism of Kadanoff and Baym.  Other  applications include a study of the
              collision term in  transport equations from a quantum mechanical viewpoint.
