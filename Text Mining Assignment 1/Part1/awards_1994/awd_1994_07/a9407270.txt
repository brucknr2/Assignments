Abstract    :
              9407270  Sytsma  This is a project to perform a detailed molecular historical
              analysis of the tropical plant families Myrtaceae (myrtle, eucalyptus, guava)
              and Melastomataceae (melastomes) and of the evening primroses (Onagraceae)
              using gene sequence from chloroplast DNA.  The project addresses questions
              involving genealogical relationships of important tropical and worldwide
              families and an important model plant in comparative studies.  It examines
              striking examples of adaptive radiations in floral biology, permits a
              comparison of the utility of morphological and molecular data in historical
              reconstructions, and allows for detailed analyses of genetic and DNA change
              through time.
