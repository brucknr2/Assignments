Abstract    :
                This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              will assist the  Department of Chemistry at the Wayne State University in the
              purchase of a Convex SPX  writer,  and a cluster of three HP 735 processors. 
              This equipment will enhance research in a  number of areas including the
              following:  (1) perform numerically intensive calculations in  the research
              areas of electronic structure theory and chemical kinetics and dynamics; (2)  
              further develop general computer programs such as VENUS and Gaussian; and (3)
              educate  students in the field of computational chemistry.    A workstation
              network of fast, modern computer workstations is a new way to satisfy the 
              computing needs of chemistry departments.  Such a "computer network" also
              serves as a  development environment for new theoretical codes and algorithms,
              and provides state-of-the-art  graphics and visualization facilities.
