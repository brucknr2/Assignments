Abstract    :
              9407308  Appel         The highly variable activity of plant chemical tannins 
              in ecological interactions has led to considerable  controversy about their
              ecological significance. It appears  that this variation and controversy arise
              from a failure to  realize the importance of oxidation in activating these 
              molecules. That is, chemicals in the plant accept electrons  from tannins and
              this in turn facilitates the action of  tannins as anti-viral agents in the
              insect gut.       In this study the importance of electron donation and 
              chemical bonding will be investigated by demonstrating the  importance of
              oxidation to tannin action by assaying the  antiviral activity of tannins in
              the presence and absence of  plant oxidants and by demonstrating that these
              oxidized  tannins bind chemically to viral proteins in the model gut  system of
              the Gypsy Moth.  ***
