Abstract    :
              9407372  Schal    Hydrocarbons comprise a major component of arthropod cuticle 
              and they play crucial roles in preventing water loss. The  German cockroach sex
              pheromone is derived from a hydrocarbon  biosynthetic pathway.  Experiments are
              proposed to  investigate which tissue(s) produces hydrocarbon and  pheromone,
              how synthesis is regulated, and examine the  mechanisms of lipid transport to
              the cuticle through the  blood by lipophorin, a reusable protein shuttle.  Dr. 
              Schal's results will identify critical, and potentially  vulnerable,
              biochemical and physiological processes in the  life of the German cockroach, a
              worldwide pest of tremendous  ecomonic and human health importance.  ***
