Abstract    :
                   This project involves the scientific coordination and  administration of
              the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry  (IGAC) Core Project of the
              International Geosphere-Biosphere  Program (IGBP).  This work includes:  (1)
              coordinating the  Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) and scientific Activities
              of  IGAC, including meeting arrangements, travel, correspondence, and  record
              keeping where appropriate, (2) developing and subsequently  updating
              descriptions of the ongoing efforts and future plans of  each of the IGAC
              Activities, (3) providing an international  information and communications
              center for IGAC, and (4) fostering  cooperation between IGAC's cosponsors (IGBP
              and the IAMAP  Commission on Atmospheric Chemistry Global Pollution (CACGP))
              and  between IGAC and its related IGBP Core Projects, other ICSU-  sponsored
              global change research programs (e.g., WCRP), and other  relevant international
              bodies (e.g., WMO).
