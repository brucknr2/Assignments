Abstract    :
              Michaels  9407851  This project investigates the six species of Geranium that
              are native and limited to the Hawaiian islands.  These species share unique
              morphological features distinguishing them from the rest of the genus and
              exhibit an array of unusual divergent species groups.  Because the group is
              both small and diverse, the Hawaiian geraniums are prime subjects for intensive
              study of island forms and the adaptive morphological changes following
              speciation.  The study is designed to evaluate the use of sequence data from
              maternally inherited chloroplast genes and the internal transcribed spacer
              region of the biparentally inherited nuclear ribosomal genes as sources of
              characters for phylogenetic (genealogical) analysis.  The research will
              contribute to expanding our limited knowledge of Hawaiian biotic history and
              will establish a phylogenetic context for planned future work on the genetic
              divergence between and within populations of the two endangered species,
              Geranium arboreum and G. multiflorum.
