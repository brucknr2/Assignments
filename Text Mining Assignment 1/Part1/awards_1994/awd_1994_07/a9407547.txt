Abstract    :
              9407547  MCLAUGHLIN        The Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research
              Fellowships are awards  to recent recipients of doctoral degrees in the
              mathematical sciences.  These  awards are a means of contributing to the future
              vitality of the scientific  effort of the nation.  As researchers in the
              mathematical sciences expand  their interactions with other disciplines, and as
              the interplay increases  between the various areas of mathematics itself,
              opportunities for  postdoctoral research and training are becoming increasingly
              important.  The  fellowships are designed to permit awardees to choose research
              environments  that will have maximal impact on their future scientific
              development.  The  fellowship is designed to provide 24 months of support
              divided into 18  academic-year months and 3 periods of two summer months.  The
              recipient may  choose (1) the Research Fellowship option which allows for
              full-time support  for any 18 academic-year months in a three-year period, in
              interval not  shorter than 3 consecutive months or (2) the Research
              Instructorship option  which allows the 18 months of academic year support to
              be taken as 9 months of  full-time support and 18 months of half-time support. 
              Not more than two  months of summer support from this Fellowship may be
              received in any calendar  year.        Richard McLaughlin received his doctoral
              degree from Princeton  University, and will pursue research under the guidance
              of Ken Golden at the  University of Utah.  The research will be conducted in
              the area of turbulent  transport, specifically on effects of randomness in
              passive and active  scalars.
