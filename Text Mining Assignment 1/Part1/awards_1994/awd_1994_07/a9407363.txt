Abstract    :
              9407363 Tang   A Neural network's ability to utilize large amounts of sensory
              information, parallel processing, learning and generalization has made it an
              attractive candidate for intelligent system control.  The objective of this
              research is to design and implement an intelligent neuro-controller for
              industrial robots.    Five basic schemes  have been used for robot control
              based on neural networks supervised control, direct inverse, neural adaptive,
              backpropagation of utility, and adaptive critics.  While the first three
              methods are good for tracking control, a truly intelligent control system
              should consider the system as a whole and should include planning and
              performance optimization.  Towards this end, the backpropagation of utility and
              adaptive critic schemes have the greatest potential because they maximize
              performance based on models or predictions of future utilization.  This
              research will investigate the strengths and weakness of the backpropagation of
              utility and adaptive critic schemes for three robotics systems, 2-D planar
              robot, 3-D Stanford arm, and the 6-D Scorbot ER-III robot.  These include
              simulation, evaluation, and ultimately  the establishment of  design guidelines
              for robot control.  With the integration of these three systems, from planar
              motion to complex six-degree motion, this project will attempt to provide a
              complete and systematic study of neuro-control for robotics systems.
