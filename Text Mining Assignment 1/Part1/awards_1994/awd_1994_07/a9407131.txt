Abstract    :
              9407131  Avise   In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that
              geographic populations of most animal species differ from one another
              genetically, and both historical and contemporary processes can influence these
              genetic distributions.  Less-well appreciated are how closely the patterns of
              geographic variation in different genes and genetic assays match one another
              within a species, or how frequently concordant patterns are exhibited across
              species.  Yet such assessments of genealogical concordance are crucial to a
              number of disciplines ranging from population genetics to systematics to
              conservation biology.  For example, concordant genetic patterns would likely
              reflect shared elements in the histories of natural selection, population
              subdivision, and gene flow.  Such patterns would also be highly relevant to
              taxonomic descriptions, and to assessments of within species biodiversity in a
              conservation context.   This project will involve molecular genetic assays of
              geographic populations within several vertebrate species in the southeastern
              United States.  The intent is to determine whether and how often concordant (as
              opposed to discordant) genetic patterns exist within these taxa, and to address
              the historical processes governing such patterns.  The goal will be to provide
              a molecular level assessment of biodiversity in the southeastern region, and to
              develop a conceptual framework for interpreting and utilizing such information.
