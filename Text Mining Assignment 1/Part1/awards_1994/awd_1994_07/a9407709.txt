Abstract    :
              9407709  Keeley  Over a period of less than ten days in the autumn of 1993, the
              southern California landscape exploded in massive wildfires that burned more
              than 200,000 acres. This ecological event, with 15 fires ignited at the same
              time, presents an unparralleled opportunity for answering several important
              questions about the regeneration of chaparral and coastal sage scrub
              vegetation. Two unique opportunities are presented by this event: (1) postfire
              successional events can be investigated in different communities and different
              climatic regions under similar initial conditions, and (2) countless replicates
              are available which will allow for sites to be selected that are similar in
              most site characteristics, except for fire intensity, pre-fire history, and
              post-fire recovery management efforts. In this study, the PI will establish a
              large set of permanent plots in different replicated communities to address
              questions that have eluded fire ecologists to date.   %%%  This study
              represents a unique opportunity to study natural regeneration processes in
              southern California chaparral and coastal sage scrub vegetation. This research
              will provide a sound scientific basis for ecosystem management as applied to
              the heavily populated southern California region. Also, emergency management
              plans have been proposed, many of which are based on emotion and limited data.
              This research will yield broadly applicable management information which will
              help to mitigate the impacts of this type of catastrophe in the future.  ***
