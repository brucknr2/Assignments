Abstract    :
              9407029  TRANGENSTEIN         Advances in computer hardware have greatly
              extended the  predictive capability of reservoir simulators.  Even with 
              current  gigaflop performance, however, the capabilities of the  machines 
              executing state-of-the-art algorithms are still far below  the  needs; in order
              to reduce the risk in planning projects, the  petroleum industry needs much
              greater computational power in  order to make improved predictions of reservoir
              performance.  Further advances can come by introducing sophisticated 
              algorithmic techniques, such as adaptive local grid  refinement  and parallel
              processing.  In this postdoctoral research  program,  we propose to extend
              adaptive local grid refinement  techniques,  currently being developed at Duke
              University for micellar-  polymer  flooding, to compositional reservoir
              simulation.  We also  propose  to investigate the parallelization of this
              algorithm on a  network  of IBM RS6000 workstations at Mobil Exploration and 
              Production  Technical Center.
