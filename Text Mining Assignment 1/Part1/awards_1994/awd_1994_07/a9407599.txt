Abstract    :
              9407849  Neckameyer                            ABSTRACT                         
                                                      Synaptic transmission is critically
              dependent on the  concentrations of neurotransmitter at the synaptic cleft. 
              Upon release of the neurotransmitter at the cleft,  neurotransmitter
              transporters contribute to the removal of  transmitter into the presynaptic
              terminal.  This limits the  duration of the neurotransmitter action, and is
              thought to  play a major role in maintaining neurotransmitter  availability at
              a variety of synapses.    The precise molecular mechanisms which regulate the
              activity  of the neurotransmitter transporters are only beginning to  be
              elucidated.  Moreover, such work has not yet addressed  the developmental and
              functional significance of perturbing  these mechanisms in vivo.  This
              application proposes to  build upon our recent cloning of Drosphila
              neurotransmitter  transporter cDNAs to examine the regulation of these 
              important proteins.  The choice of Drosophila enables us to  bring to bear some
              of the unique advantages of this model  system (such as the facility in
              generating both transgenic  animals as well as mutations specific to genetic
              loci) on  these important questions.    These studies will take advantage of
              recombinant DNA  methodology to (1) identify the specific neurotransmitter 
              substrate for each of the transporters isolated thus far,  and (2) to initiate
              a molecular genetic analysis of the  transporter loci.  These initial studies
              will lay the  groundwork for future experiments that will assess the 
              developmental and  functional consequences in vivo of  perturbing reuptake
              regulatory mechanisms by introducing  altered transporter genes into the genome
              of  Drosphila.  These studies will increase our comprehension of the role  that
              neurotransmitter transporters play in synaptic  transmission.
