Abstract    :
              9407008  AVELLANEDA       This project concerns the study of flow and dispersion
               in  porous media, in particular the estimation of the physical  properties of
              porous media such as permeability and the  hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient
              of solutes.  There has  been  considerable effort devoted to exploring
              correlations  between  such physical properties as diffusional relaxation
              times,  conductivity and sound velocity, and the hydrodynamic  permeability and
              dispersion coefficient.  These macroscopic  constants are linked because they
              arise by solving similar  equations on the same microstructure.  We will
              construct  bounds  and estimators of permeability and dispersion coefficient 
              based  on knowledge of more easily measured properties.  This  problem  has
              been studied for some time, and was pioneered in work by  Schlumberger
              scientists.       The transport and dispersion of solutes in porous media  will
               be analyzed through analysis and numerical calculation of  different
              microstructures, e.g. networks of capillaries or  intergranular space.  We will
              perform theoretical and  numerical  studies in which we will concentrate on the
              following  issues: i)  building efficient numerical algorithms for modelling 3D
               transport in porous media, ii) modelling porous media which  are  bi-periodic
              or contain two or more characteristic scales,  iii)  studying flow and
              dispersion in partially saturated porous  media.
