Abstract    :
              9407028  Wheeler       The primary objective of the fellowhsip is to expose  the
              postdoctoral associate (PA) to important computational  engineering and
              mathematics problems arising in flow through  porous media.  We will focus on
              the areas of uncertainty  estimation and development of parallel algorithms for
               simulation of flow and transport processes.  During the  course of the
              fellowship, the PA will develop and apply flow  and transport parallel sofware
              (including rescaling  techniques) combines with software for reservoir 
              characterization, gridding, and  uncertainty estimation to  an actual  BP
              reservoir.  The software will be used in  analyzing production performance of
              the reservoir.       The participants in this fellowship include Rice 
              University, where the mentors will be Professors Clint  Dawson and Mary F.
              Wheeler, and British Petroleum, where the  mentor will be Dr. Michael Christie.
               The PA will be exposed  to several techniques which are part of BP's and
              Rice's  current activities.  In particular, Rice has expertise in  parallel
              computing and algorithm development, while BP has  expertise in rescaling
              techniques, reservoir  characterization, and well management.       The PA will
              be trained in the engineering and  mathematical aspects of the emerging areas
              of uncertainty  estimation and parallel computation.  This will equip the PA 
              to work as a specialist in reservoir simulation, hydrology,  or any other areas
              where estimating uncertainty and/or  parallel computation are low key.
