Abstract    :
              9407279  Cohn         This project is designed to better understand the
              mechanism  and ecological role of cell movement in a ubiquitous and 
              ecologically important group of algae known as diatoms. Diatoms  are among the
              most abundant primary food sources in many aquatic  food chains, and their
              ability to move within the sediment is  believed to be important to their
              ecological success. These cells  can generate movement despite being confined
              within a hardened  glass-like cell wall that restricts any direct contact
              between  the inner cell and the surface over which it moves. This project  is
              designed to help determine the ecological functions of diatom  movement and the
              factors which regulate this movement by: 1)  using a computer-assisted video
              microscope system to  quantitatively analyze the characteristics of diatom
              movement  under a variety of environmental conditions; 2) performing 
              comparative analysis of the movement of different diatom species  displaying a
              variety of cell wall features and shapes; and 3)  performing competition
              experiments to determine the relative  abilities of different diatom species in
              a mixed population to  undergo vertical movements and compete for limited
              resources  (e.g., space, light or nutrients).       These studies should help
              to determine a number of diatom  properties including: the environmental cues
              and conditions which  affect diatom movement; the ability of diatoms to survive
              or  become acclimated over time changes in environmental conditions;  and the
              type of movements undertaken by various species to try  and compete for limited
              resources such as light and nutrients.  ***
