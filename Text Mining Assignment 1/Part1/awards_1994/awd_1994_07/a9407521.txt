Abstract    :
              9407521  Blecher       Experiments on the radiative muon capture in hydrogen and
               helium-3 will be carried out in order to further understanding of  the
              fundamental electroweak interaction and its effects in well  understood complex
              nuclear systems.  This work will be carried  out at the TRIUMF facility in
              Canada.  Compton scattering and  pion photoproduction experiments, both using
              linearly polarized  photons, will be carried out at the Brookhaven National 
              Laboratory's Laser Electron Gamma Source.  The goal of this  experiment is to
              extract information on the deformation of the  lowest energy nucleon resonance.
               Lastly, an experiment to search  for time reversal violation in k-meson decays
              will be carried out  at the KEK facility in Japan.  This experiment will search
              for  phenomena not predicted within the currently accepted standard  model of
              fundamental interactions.  ***
