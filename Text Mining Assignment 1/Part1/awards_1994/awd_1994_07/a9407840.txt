Abstract    :
              9407840  Emerson                              ABSTRACT                          
                                                                                     One of
              the oldest questions in animal biology is "how does a  single cell - the
              fertilized egg - give rise to a complex  adult body form?". More specifically,
              how is the genetic  information, which is identical in all cells of an embryo, 
              expressed such that cells become different?  Dr. Emerson  proposes to use
              recently-developed molecular biological  techniques, such as the polymerase
              chain reaction (PCR), to  address these questions.  Since PCR requires only
              small  amounts of tissue, it is ideally suited to the  identification of new
              genes that control important  developmental processes in the mammalian embryo.
