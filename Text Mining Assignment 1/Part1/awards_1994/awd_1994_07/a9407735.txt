Abstract    :
              9407735  Molian   The award is for research to a model for the reactive
              gas-assisted laser cutting of thick metals, which is based on solving the
              fundamental equations of mass, energy, and momentum, in both the molten film
              and gas regions.  Experiments are proposed for verification as well as
              reevaluation of the proposed model.  The erosion front is treated as a free
              surface and is allowed to assume its profile depending on the momentum transfer
              from the gas jet.  Combustion phenomena in the molten film are modeled using
              first order reaction kinetics.  The approach is expected to yield a
              satisfactory representation of the coupling between various physical phenomena
              such as fluid dynamics, heat transfer, and combustion.   The research is
              expected to result in improved understanding of the laser cutting process and
              development of more efficient cutting procedures.  Given the increasing
              availability of more powerful lasers for manufacturing applications, the
              improved understanding achieved here would enable better utilization of these
              advances in material processing capability.
