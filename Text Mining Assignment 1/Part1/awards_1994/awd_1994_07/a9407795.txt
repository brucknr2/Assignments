Abstract    :
              9407795  Lane   The R.L. McGregor Herbarium (KANU) is the primary documenting
              herbarium for the Great Plains Flora and other taxonomic and floristic works on
              Great Plains plants.  It houses 408,015 specimens and library/archival items
              that were assembled over the past twelve decades and which are the basis for
              the existing 109,000-record Kansas Plant Database and the developing Central
              U.S. Plant Inventory Database (CUSPID), both of which will be
              Internet-accessible within three years, pending funding.  The paleobotanical
              collections are also significant, contain a particularly high proportion of
              types, and are databased.  The facilities improvement project proposed here
              will result in:  Installation of a fire suppression and alarm system will
              prevent the currently overwhelming threat that the potential for fire presents.
               KANU is currently housed in a somewhat isolated, single-story building has a
              wooden roof, no internal fire walls, no fire alarms, no fire insurance (by
              Kansas state law), and only four hand-held fire extinguishers in 9,000 square
              feet of space.  The building also houses electrical appliances and laboratory
              equipment that could throw sparks and an assortment of laboratory chemicals
              that could prove explosive.  In the case of fire, the Clean Agent FM-200 fire
              suppression and detection system proposed here would sound audible alarms,
              notify the closest fire station, police, and designated responsible
              individuals, and if not prevented by human decision would release a dry
              chemical fire suppression agent in the affected area of the building.  The
              agent is environmentally safe and nonpoisonous to humans; it is also
              non-wetting, so the specimens would not suffer water damage.  Preservation of
              the collections of the R.L. McGregor Herbarium will ensure that the fundamental
              units of natural information, the specimens of organisms, will survive into the
              future, thus continuing to voucher the Kansas Plant Database, the KANU
              Paleobotanical Database, and the planned CUSPID.
