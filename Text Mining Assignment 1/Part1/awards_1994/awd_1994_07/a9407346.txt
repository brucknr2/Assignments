Abstract    :
              9407346  Allen    This is a Research Planning Grant.  The proposed research  to
              be conducted during the planning period is the cloning,  overexpression and
              crystallization of the enzyme proline  racemase.  The research following the
              proposed planning  period is the determination of the structure of proline 
              racemase by X-ray crystallography in the native state and in  the presence of
              substrates, substrate analogs and transition  state analogs.  Proline racemase
              has been shown to induce  strain/destabilization of substrate, one of four
              mechanisms  by which enzymes bring about rate accelarations. The induced 
              strain is relieved in the enzyme-transition state complex.  Of the modes of
              catalysis, the least understood is  strain/destabilization since it is
              difficult to devise  experiments for its evaluation.  The comparison of the
              X-ray  crystal structures of the enzyme-substrate and enzyme-  transition state
              analog complexes of proline racemase will  allow direct observation of the
              structural and chemical  means by which this enzyme achieves
              strain/destabilization  of the substrate.  %%%  There are few cases in which
              enzymes have been proven to  undergo strain/destabilization in the
              enzyme-substrate  complex.  Proline racemase is the sole example in which 
              transition state and substrate analogs exist and which is  amenable to study by
              X-ray crystallography.   The structure  of these complexes will provide the
              basis by which we can  understand the strain/destabilization mode of catalysis.
