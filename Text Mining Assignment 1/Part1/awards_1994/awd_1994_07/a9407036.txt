Abstract    :
              9407036  Steinmetz  Marquette University    The photochemistry of aryl
              substituted di- and tri-silanes will be investigated. The hypothesis will be
              tested that the triplet local excited state (3LE) is populated by a 1LE -> CT
              -> 3LE sequence of electron transfer processes, which passes through a charge
              transfer state (CT). A p-cyanostilbenyl substituted disilane will be used to
              distinguish the singlet and triplet LE states by triplet quenching. These
              states will also be monitored by unique photo-products from a disilanyl
              substituted benzo 2.2.2 bicyclooctenone. CT photoreactivity will be monitored
              through kinetic studies involving reaction with alcohols. In addition, a study
              of wavelength effects on silylene extrusion versus electron transfer in
              trisilane systems will be pursued. The photoreactivity of exciplexes will also
              be probed by tethering the disilanyl electron transfer donor to electron
              deficient styrenes.     This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports
              the work of Professor Mark G. Steinmetz at Marquette University. The
              photochemistry of compounds containing two and three silicon atoms bonded
              together will be studied. These compounds will also have a benzene-like
              substituent bonded to one of the silicon atoms. Ultraviolet light absorption by
              these compounds produces excited states from which photochemistry may proceed.
              These excited states and photo-products will be characterized. The results may
              provide insight to the design of photoresists that are important in the
              electronics industry.
