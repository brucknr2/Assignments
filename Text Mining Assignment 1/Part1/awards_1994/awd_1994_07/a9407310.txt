Abstract    :
              9407310  Johnson                            ABSTRACT                            
                                                   Animal mating systems are a central topic
              in evolutionary  biology, because mating patterns can greatly affect the  speed
              and path of evolution in a population.  Recent  advances in molecular biology
              have revealed that avian  mating systems are not always as they appear:  for
              example,  many species long thought to be faithfully monogamous are  actually
              quite promiscuous.  Dr. Johnson will describe the  social mating system
              (behavior) in a colony of Great-Tailed  Grackles, use DNA microsatellites to
              characterize the  genetic mating system (parentage), and test existing 
              hypotheses for the evolution of polygynous mating systems.
