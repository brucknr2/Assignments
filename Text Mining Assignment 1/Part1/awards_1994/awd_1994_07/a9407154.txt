Abstract    :
              Magneto-electro-optics represents a new facet of optical  investigations in
              which electric fields perturb magneto-  optic effects and magnetic fields
              perturb electro-optic  effects. Many fundamental magneto-optic effects in
              magnetic  semiconductors and their superlattices require large  magnetic fields
              to resolve spectroscopic features in dilute  magnetic materials with weak
              magnetization. This project  provides funds to Purdue University for the
              purchase of a 9  Tesla transverse-field optical cryostat for solid-state 
              research on magneto-electro-optic effects in semiconductors,  superconductors
              and magnetic oxides. The high magnetic field  will allow access to new physical
              phenomena that are  currently inaccessible. The apparatus will be used by three
               principal investigators and their students engaged in four  independent, but
              related, research projects. The high-field  cryostat is necessary for studies
              of Faraday Effect, Voigt  Effect and Excitonic Zeeman Effect, especially with
              respect  to saturation features. Purdue University has a strong  effort in
              magnetic semiconductors with substantial growth  and fabrication facilities
              that would fully support the  research needs.
