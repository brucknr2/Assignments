Abstract    :
              9407691  Marler                              ABSTRACT                           
                                                                                    The goal
              of this research is to develop the mountain spiny  lizard Sceloporus jarrovi as
              a model system for studying  neuroendocrine control of territorial aggressive
              behavior.  Aggressive behavior in this species is sterotypic, but there  is
              both interseasonal and intraseasonal variation.  Thus  these lizards provide an
              ideal system for investigating how  long term and short term gradations in
              aggression can be  physiologically controlled while the animals are behaving in
               their natural environment.  The focus for these studies will  be the
              neuropeptide arginine vasotocin (AVT) which is known  to influence reproductive
              behavior.  A primary technique  employed in the proposed research will be 
              immunocytochemistry, which, through the use of image  analysis techniques, will
              be used to compare concentrations  of AVT within the brains of animals
              displaying varying  levels of aggression.  This technique will also allow 
              identification of brain regions that may be associated with  short and long
              term changes in aggression, as well as any  morphological changes in AVT
              immunoreactive cells or fibers.  Because of seasonal variation in the natural
              patterns of  aggression and testosterone in S. jarrovi it will also be 
              possible to uncouple the effects of testosterone and  aggression on the
              expression of AVT-ir within the brain.  Finally, the effects of artificially
              increased levels of AVT  on territorial aggression will be examined while the
              animal  is in its natural environment.  These studies will begin to  examine if
              AVT influences aggression in a strongly  territorial species and how tightly
              coupled AVT is with  testosterone and aggression.
