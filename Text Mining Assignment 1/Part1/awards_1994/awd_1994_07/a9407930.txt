Abstract    :
              9407930  Neuhauser    San Francisco State University and the Direct Detection
              group at  Berkeley are beginning a project to investigate the use of 
              superconducting tunnel junction (STJ) arrays as phonon  spectrometers for the
              detection of weakly interacting dark matter  particle candidates.  The STJ
              arrays will be fabricated in the Thin  Film Laboratory at SFSU, and initial
              testing will be done in a 300  mK cryostat at SFSU.  Recently an opportunity
              has arisen to make  use of an adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator (ADR) at
              Berkeley  for testing the devices.  The availability of this cryostat will 
              enable "proof of principle" experiments on small samples at 80 mK,  closer to
              the 20 mK temperature planned for operation of the  detectors.  The ADR will be
              instrumented with an experimental stage  and cryogenic preamplifiers for
              initial device tests during this  award period.  ***
