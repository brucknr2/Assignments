Abstract    :
              9407826  McLoon                              ABSTRACT                           
                                                                                    The
              extraocular muscles, the muscles that move the eye in  the orbit, are different
              from other mature skeletal muscles  in mammals.  They have a number of
              characteristics seen only  in immature or regenerating muscle, such as the
              continued  expression of immature or embryonic proteins and as well as 
              immature patterns of innervation.  This study proposes to  examine the
              possibility that either these muscles fail to  fully mature or that the
              extraocular muscles, unlike other  skeletal muscles continue to divide in the
              mature mammal to  produce new muscle fibers.  This will hopefully shed light 
              on possible mechanisms that control when and how muscle  cells divide.
