Abstract    :
               The major obstacle to developing automated tools for the  detection  of faults
              in concurrent software systems is the state explosion  problem:  the number of
              possible states of a concurrent system is,  in general,  exponential in the
              number of processes making up the  system.  A number of  techniques have been
              proposed to address this  problem, but most real concurrent  software systems
              remain beyond  the reach of existing approaches to analysis.  This project
              continues the development of an approach to  analysis based on  generating
              necessary conditions for the existence  of certain executions of a  concurrent
              system and using integer  programming to check the consistency of  those
              conditions.  This  approach does not require enumeration or explicit 
              representation of  the states of the system being analyzed, and can be used to 
              check  such properties as deadlock, starvation, mutual exclusion, and  minimum 
              and maximum elapsed time between events.  This project  includes research  to
              take advantage of the compositional  structure and symmetries of a  concurrent
              system and investigates  connections with other automated analysis  methods.
