Abstract    :
              9407099  Schoonen  The objective of the research is to evaluate through 
              experimental studies and field work the role sulfur  oxyanions may play in
              hydrothermal systems.  Because little  is known about the stability of these
              sulfur species, the PI  has conducted experiments in the first stage of this
              program  to study the stability of thiosulfate.  For this funding  cycle, the
              PI proposes to focus the experimental work on the  formation of thiosulfate. 
              Two pathways for thiosulfate  formation:  1) H2S-SO4 equilibration in the
              presence of  mineral surfaces and metal ions, and 2) H2S oxidation with 
              FE(III) bearing minerals as oxidants will be studied to  temperatures up to
              250oC.  A third major pathway, H2S  oxidation by O2, is the focus of our field
              work.  Yellowstone will be used as a natural lab to complement the 
              experimental studies at Stony Brook.  This field work will  prepare us for the
              challenges of sampling deep hydrothermal  fluids which is a long-term
              objective.
