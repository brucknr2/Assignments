Abstract    :
              9407059  Osteryoung  North Carolina State  In this project in the Chemistry
              Division, Dr. Janet Osteryoung will lead a delegation of U.S. chemists to
              Poland to seek ways to develop mutually beneficial research projects, personnel
              exchanges, and other scientific interactions.  The visit, which is coordinated
              with the Polish Chemical Society (PCS) and the Committee on Scientific Research
              (KBN) of the Polish government,  will give the American chemical community a
              better insight into the actual state of chemistry in Poland, identifying
              strengths, weaknesses, and grounds for collaboration.  The delegation will make
              recommendations about initiating useful cooperative efforts, and the results
              will be disseminated in a report to the American scientific community.
