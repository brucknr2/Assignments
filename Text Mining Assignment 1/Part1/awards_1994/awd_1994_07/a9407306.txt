Abstract    :
              This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry  
              Program, concerns the combination of capillary electrophoresis in   narrow-bore
              capillaries with sensitive and selective detection methods to   address several
              unique experiments in cellular neuroscience.  The three   fundamental goals of
              this project are to develop ultra-low volume   separation methods to
              dynamically and selectively follow chemical release   from single nerve cells,
              growth cones, and synapses; to develop capillary   electrophoresis-mass
              spectrometry to quantify phospholipids in membranes   of whole cells, regional
              sections of the plasma membrane, and axonal   growth cones in culture; and to
              develop methods to identify and quantify   chemical messengers in single
              developing growth cones.  These techniques   will be brought to bear on two
              important areas of neurobiology, namely   neural development through the study
              of growth cones and cell-to-cell   communication through events at the
              membrane.      The analytical methodology development to be pursued in this
              project,   which builds upon results obtained by Professor Ewing and his
              students   during the tenure of NSF grant CHE-9106832, is important to the  
              achievement of dimensionally and molecularly selective neurochemical  
              measurements at the single cell level.  These general methodologies are   also
              important in biotechnology and can be expected to contribute to the  
              development of essential instrumentation for environmental studies
