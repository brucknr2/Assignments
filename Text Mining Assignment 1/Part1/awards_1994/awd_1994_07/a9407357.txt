Abstract    :
              9407357  Jakob    In order to gain insight into how social behavior evolves, we 
              must understand how individuals decide whether or not to join a  group.  Dr.
              Jakob has chosen a model system to study in which the  species is facultatively
              social.  This means that individuals  live in groups at some time while at
              other times live alone.  Dr.  Jakob will examine the decision-making process of
              this species at  four levels.  First, she will determine the stimuli that evoke
               social behavior.  Second, Dr. Jakob will examine the effect of  the animal's
              state, particularly its energy level, on  responsiveness to those stimuli that
              evoke social behavior.   Third, she will study the development of the behavior
              over an  individual's lifespan.  Finally, this work will ultimately lead  to
              identifying those factors the affect the evolution of  sociality.
