Abstract    :
              9407975  Christy       The research entails the study of low dimensional
              dynamical  systems and relevant topological structures. The techniques are 
              drawn from combinatorial topology and hyperbolic systems. The aim  is a
              classification of low dimensional systems which can be  implemented via
              algorithmic design to computational methods.  This would then lead to
              applications in other areas of  mathematics, such as the topological structures
              on 3-manifolds  and and quantum field theory.  ***
