Abstract    :
              9407760  Burdzy    This two-year award supports U.S.-U.K. cooperative research
              in  statistics and probability between Krzysztof Burdzy of the  University of
              Washington and Wilfred S. Kendall of the University  of Warwick in the United
              Kingdom. The investigators will work  together on several modern mathematical
              problems in probabilistic  potential theory, specifically, convexity and the
              Neumann heat  kernel, and the stochastic integral for iterated Brownian motion.
                 The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration considerable  expertise
              in probability, especially the area of Brownian motion.   This is complemented
              by the British investigator's knowledge of  geometric analysis and stochastic
              analysis.  The project will  advance our understanding in stochastic analysis
              and lead to new  connections between probability and partial differential 
              equations.  The research on convexity and the Neumann heat kernel  is important
              for understanding of heat diffusion.  It also  relates to the probability
              theory of Brownian motion.  ***
