Abstract    :
              9407177  McDonald  This project is to advance and broaden our knowledge in the
              areas  of plant cell biotechnology, ribosome inactivating proteins  (RIPs), and
              plant cell bioprocess engineering.  This project has  three specific goals,
              which include: (1) characterization of the  transformation of plant cell
              cultures by the plant pathogen  Agrobacterium rhizogenes; (2) quantification of
              cell growth and  RIP production in suspension culture;   and (3) purification
              and  characterization of proteins obtained from the cell cultures.   RIPs are
              naturally occurring plant proteins thought to be  ubiquitous in the plant
              kingdom, and are currently receiving  considerable attention for their
              antiviral, antitumor and  abortifacient properties.  They are also being
              considered for  their potential use in immunotoxin preparation and for their 
              ability to confer resistance to plant pathogens.  ***
