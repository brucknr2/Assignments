Abstract    :
                          9407979  McIntosh  Plants, unlike other organisms, possess two
              respiratory pathways:  the "normal" cytochrome pathway and an "alternative
              pathway".  This  is important because alternative pathway respiration does not 
              contribute to a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial  membrane and
              thus electrons that flow down this pathway do not  conserve energy.  All plants
              apparently contain an alternative  pathway of respiration, that may be induced
              in response to  developmental signals (such as increased carbohydrate status
              and  flowering) and many environmental stimuli (such as cold, wounding,  and
              endogenous salicylic acid concentrations).  Why should plants  have a more
              complex respiratory system than most other eukaryotes  and what is its
              funciton?  Although it is not possible to form a  complete answer now,
              alternative pathway respiration is most  probably involved in the regulation of
              energy/carbon balance in  plants in response to varying demands of development
              and the  environment.  A classic approach to dissect the importance and 
              function of any pathway is to study mutants in the pathway.  No  plant mutants
              have been isolated for alternative pathway  respiration, possibly because of
              its proposed regulatory functions.   The approach put forward in this research
              is to create plant lines  with altered amounts of cytochrome oxidase and
              alternative oxidase,  and to use these lines to elucidate the genetic,
              biochemical, and  biophysical regulation of respiratory energy balance in
              plants.   Tomato and potato plants will be used as experimental systems.    ***
