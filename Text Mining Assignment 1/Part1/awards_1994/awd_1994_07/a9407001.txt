Abstract    :
              9407001  Cooke  The aims are to organize and conduct a conference in October,
              1994  bringing together researchers of varied background on the subject  of
              motor proteins, and to produce a reference work on the subject.  From their
              beginnings over 10 years ago, the intent of the  Biophysical Discussions has
              been to discuss areas that have been  heavily influenced by biophysical
              approaches.  As was successfully  done with past meetings in this series,
              papers will be submitted  prior to the conference.  Fifteen to twenty full
              Discussion papers  will be solicited by invitation.  Some 40 more two-page
              papers will  be invited for presentation in plenary poster sessions.  Formal 
              discussions, poster sessions, and evening workshops will all build  on the
              understanding that people have come to the meeting informed  of the contents of
              the Study Book.  Following the meeting these  papers will be published with a
              transcript of the recorded debate.   ***
