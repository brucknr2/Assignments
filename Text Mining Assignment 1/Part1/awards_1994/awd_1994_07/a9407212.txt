Abstract    :
              This project will collect baseline information about the physical  features,
              fauna and flora of a representative number of  locations.  These locations have
              never been inventoried, even  though they are heavily visited by both tourists
              and scientists.   The project will generate substantial information that is 
              presently unavailable.  These data are extremely relevant to the  preparation
              and the evaluation of environmental assessments as  required by the 1991
              Protocol on Environmental Protection to the  Antarctic Treaty.
