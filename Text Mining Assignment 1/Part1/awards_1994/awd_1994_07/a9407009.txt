Abstract    :
              9407009  Abruna  This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface 
              Chemistry Program, is directed at developing an understanding  of the process
              of underpotential deposition of metals on  metals.  The effects of surface
              morphology and potential  dependent distributional changes of interfacial
              species will be  probed using a combination of dynamic electrochemical methods,
               X-ray scattering probes such as EXAFS and X-ray reflectivity,  and UHV
              electron spectroscopic methods.  Growth modes in the  deposition of silver and
              copper on platinum electrodes will be  examined, and the effect of the
              structure of the adsorbed layer  on the metal deposition process will be
              characterized.  This  information is crucial to the understanding of
              electroplating  and thin film growth.  %%%  The detailed mechanism of the
              electrochemical deposition of  thin metal films on metal substrates is the
              focus of this  research project.  A unique combination of X-ray and 
              electrochemical methods will be used to provide insights into  the effect of
              surface morphology and electrode-solution  interfacial structure on the
              deposition process.  This  information is useful for understanding
              technologically  important processes such as electroplating and corrosion 
              inhibition.
