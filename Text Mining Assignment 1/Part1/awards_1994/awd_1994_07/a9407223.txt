Abstract    :
                    In the field of computational biology, an important emerging subspecialty
              is the use of  intelligent systems in support of molecular biology.  Techniques
              drawn from artificial  intelligence, machine learning, intelligent databases,
              qualitative and quantitative  modelling, parallel computing, and robotics are
              being successfully applied to problems in  genetics, sequence analysis, protein
              structure, molecular evolution, development, and  many other problems in
              biology.  Following on the success of the 1993 First International  Conference
              on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) in Bethesda, we  propose to
              host the second conference in the series at Stanford University, Palo Alto, 
              California, on August 14 through 17, 1994.  We propose again to bring together 
              computer scientists and biologists for cross-disciplinary exchange of results
              and ideas.   The conference will consist of rigorously refereed papers,
              posters, demonstrations,  archival proceedings, tutorials, and invited
              speakers.
