Abstract    :
              9407846  Lindberg    The University of California Museum of Paleontology (UCMP)
              houses one of the nation's largest and most important collections of fossil
              vertebrates, invertebrates, protists, and plants.  For more than a decade UCMP
              has required additional space to facilitate curation and research activity as
              well as maintain archival activity.  This funding will permit installation of a
              mobile compactor system for the museum.  Because we have coordinated the
              installation of the mobile compactors with the move of the museum to new
              facilities, the level of institutional support is substantial.  Funding of this
              proposal will:    {SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h} provide a complete physical
              reorganization of the collection  {SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h} improve
              collection conservation  {SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h} provide efficient
              and effective access to specimens  {SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h} provide
              more efficient use of collection space  {SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h}
              increased availability of collection data to the paleontological and
              neontological communities  {SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h} provide space for
              the compete curation of several orphaned collections.
