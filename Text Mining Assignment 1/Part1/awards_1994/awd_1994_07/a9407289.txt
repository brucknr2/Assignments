Abstract    :
              9407289  Zink  U. of California - Los Angeles  Dr. Jeffrey I. Zink, Chemistry
              Department, University of California - Los Angeles, is supported by the
              Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
              Division for research into the electronic excited states of metal-containing
              molecules. Excited state geometries will be determined from highly resolved
              vibronic structure in emission and excitation spectra of molecules in the cold
              collision-free conditions of a supersonic free expansion jet and by excited
              state pump-probe Raman spectroscopy. Resonance Raman excitation profiles and
              low temperature single crystal polarized electronic absorption and emission
              spectroscopy will then be used to determine distortions in the excited state.
              The goal of these studies is a unified understanding of excited potential
              surfaces which will lead to an understanding of the geometries, reactivities,
              electronic structure and vibronic interactions which occur as metal complexes
              are in their excited states.     Before normally stable molecules will undergo
              chemical reactions, they must be "excited" so that they become less stable and
              more reactive. This project aims at determining what changes metal containing
              compounds undergo as they are "excited" by the addition of energy. This is
              important because the "excited state" of a molecule must be understood in order
              to predict its chemical behavior. This investigation will concentrate on some
              molecules which are important to establishing a general understanding of the
              behavior of "excited states" and some which have important reactions which
              occur in the gas phase, such as those used as precursors for electronic
              materials.
