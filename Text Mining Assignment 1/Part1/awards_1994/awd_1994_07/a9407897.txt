                                            ABSTRACT                                  9407897 
              Datta      Brain  growth  require careful regulation.  Too much uncontrolled 
              growth  is  characteristic of cancer or neuroblastoma.  Too little brain 
              growth  results in birth  defects such as spina  bifida  or anencephaly.  To
              understand how brain growth is controlled,  Dr. Datta  is  studying specialized
              cells that  can  make  more  brain cells.  The  body  regulates  brain cell 
              production by  turning  activity  on  and  off by these cells.  It is 
              important  to  know which genes are involved  in controlling when and where
              stem cells make  brain  cells  to  understand how the  body  regulates  this
              process.   gene has been  identified that turns on the  ability of  the  stem
              cells to make brain cells. Now she wants  to  know what kind of protein this
              gene makes  and how it turns on the stem cells.
