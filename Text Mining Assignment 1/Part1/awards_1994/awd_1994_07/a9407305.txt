Abstract    :
              9407305  Mann                              ABSTRACT                             
                                                                                 
              Reproductive experience (pregnancy and lactation) has long-  term effects on
              hormonal, behavioral and neurochemical  endpoints in female mammals, including
              affecting litter size  in hamsters, timing of reproductive events in miniature 
              swine, salt intake in rat and maternal behavior in mice,  rats, gerbils,
              squirrels, ewes, and monkeys.  Interestingly,  reproductive experience also
              alters the brain, demonstrating  neural plasticity in the adult female mammal. 
              So far, only  the endogenous opioid system has been shown to be altered  both
              behaviorally and physiologically by reproductive  experience.  The goal of this
              Research Planning Grant is to  utilize in situ hybridization histochemistry
              (ISHH) to  determine if there are permanent changes in brain opioid  prohormone
              gene expression as a consequence of repeated  reproductive experience.  During
              the 18 months of the  planning period the ISHH technique will be set up and 
              tested.  When the technique has been perfected research will  start to
              determine the long-term effects of repeated  reproductive states.  The levels
              of message RNA of the  opioid prohormone, proopiomelanocortin (POMC), will be 
              examined during the estrous cycle and during pregnancy in  the brain of female
              rats will undergo steroid regimens that  mimic pregnancy to uncover the
              mechanism underlying this  effect.  To demonstrate that repeated pregnancies
              and  lactations produce long-term, possibly permanent, changes in  the brain of
              the adult mammal has important implications for  the study of neural plasticity
              and reproductive  neurobiology.
