Abstract    :
              9407151  Iwamoto   The preserved fish collection of the California Academy of
              Sciences (CAS) is considered the second most important international
              ichthyological research resource in North America.  Of the 218,00 specimen lots
              contained, only 60,000 (27.5%) are currently entered in a computer database. 
              This will capture catalog data from hand-written CAS and former Stanford
              University catalog ledgers using the MUSE collection-management software.  This
              accomplished, the Academy's fish collection will have more than 157,000 records
              in its electronic database, representing 72% of its total collection.  In a
              subsequent phase, electronic cataloging will capture data for all 61,000
              remaining uncataloged lots.  When completed, the database will allow
              maintenance of better inventories and records of collections and loan
              transactions, immediate access to collection data, and quick and efficient
              computer-generation of lists of specimens, localities, and other custom-sorted
              data for the user community.  Cost savings in personnel time necessary to carry
              out these routine functions will be enormous compared with using the old
              hand-written ledger and records systems.  The value and use of the collections
              will be greatly enchanced by the unlocking of information previously
              unretrievable because of limitations in time and personnel.  Time saved by
              curatorial staff will be better used to continue high-quality maintenance of
              the collection.  Sharing of the captured data set will be a prime concern, and
              to this end the collection database will be made accessible to the world
              community through Internet, using the Gopher system.
