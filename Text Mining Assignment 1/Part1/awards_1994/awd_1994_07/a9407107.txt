Abstract    :
              Abstract  MCB9407107  Lefebvre  Funds are requested for partial support of the
              VI International  Conference on Cell and Molecular Biology of Chlamydomonas, to
              be  held at the Granlibakken Conference Center in Tahoe City,  California, May
              17-22, 1994.  Approximately 250-300 investigators  from the U.S. and abroad are
              expected to attend.  The meeting will  be sponsored by the Genetics Society of
              America as one of its  organismic group conferences.  ***  Chlamydomonas is a
              powerful model organism for genetic, cell  biological, and molecular biological
              studies of a wide range of  fundamental biological processes.  The biennial
              Chlamydomonas  conference is the only meeting which brings together
              investigators  form different fields and disciplines to discuss the common 
              approaches and methodologies being used with this organism.  The  meeting is
              important for the dissemination of new information, for  establishing
              collaborations, and for promoting the exchange of  mutants and molecular
              probes.  %%%
