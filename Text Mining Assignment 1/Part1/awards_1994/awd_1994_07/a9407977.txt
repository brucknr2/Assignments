Abstract    :
              9407977  Magnus  The focus of this research is the development of new synthetic 
              methodology using hypervalent iodine chemistry.  The potential  of the
              chemistry for the beta-functionalization of carbonyl  groups and for the
              oxidation of amine derivatives will be  tested.  In particular, the preparation
              of highly  functionalized ring systems and the oxidation of proline-like 
              compounds will be attempted.  %%%  With this renewal award, the Synthetic
              Organic Program is  supporting the research of Dr. Philip D. Magnus of the 
              Department of Chemistry at the University of Texas, Austin.  Professor Magnus
              will focus his work on developing new  synthetic organic transformations by
              using hypervalent iodine  chemistry.  ***
