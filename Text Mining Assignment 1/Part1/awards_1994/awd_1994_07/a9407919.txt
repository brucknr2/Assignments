Abstract    :
              9407919  Power     Relatively little is known about the impact of viruses on
              natural plant populations.  The objectives of this research project are to
              measure the movement of a plant virus between natural and agricultural
              communities and to determine the effect of this virus on wild grasses growing
              in old-field succession sites.  This project focuses on the barley yellow dwarf
              virus, a widespread virus transmitted to both wild and cultivated grasses by
              aphids.    This research will improve our understanding of the relationship
              between viruses and their wild and native hosts and on the potential for
              disease and genetic material to spread between agricultural plants and their
              wild relatives and vice versa.  The results will have direct application in
              plant pathology, pest control, and agriculture.  They may also have application
              to environmental-impact studies of the field cultivation of genetically altered
              crop plants.
