Abstract    :
              9407939  Talamantes    Several peptides originally identified in the
              hypothalamus  are also present in the placenta.  One of these peptides is 
              growth hormone-releasing hormone.  The factors that regulate  expression of the
              growth hormone-releasing hormone gene in  the placenta and its function in the
              placenta are not  understood.  This project will address two basic questions: 
              (1) what are some of the structural features in the mouse  growth
              hormone-releasing hormone gene that regulate its  expression in the placenta?
              and (2) does placental growth  hormone-releasing hormone regulate the
              production of a group  of hormones in the placenta which are known to play 
              important roles in maintaining a successful pregnancy?  The  latter hormones
              include the placental lactogens.  These  questions are a logical extension of
              the very limited  research that has been carried out in this field so far, and 
              the information gained from this project will provide a good  basis for future
              work in an area that could prove to be very  important to understanding
              placental physiology.  ***
