Abstract    :
              9407159  Edmondson    The purpose of this project is to conduct the last phase
              of a log-term study of Lake Washington that started in 1955.  The lake has been
              subjected to a series of external disturbances, four of which have been studied
              as they developed.  Earlier ones have been studied in cores by
              paleolimnological methods.    An abrupt increase in the alkalinity of the lake
              (acid neutralizing capacity or content of alkaline substances) in 1988 is
              attributed to the probable effect of land development on the chemical content
              of streams draining the developed areas.  The change was accompanied by an
              inconspicuous but significant change in the phytoplankton.    The aim of this
              project is to pursue two goals:    1.  Characterizing the condition of the lake
              by measuring on a regular schedule features that are relevant to the change in
              alkalinity.  These are a set of chemical properties and a set of biological
              properties that are affected by chemical conditions.       Focus is on the
              abundance and species composition of the phytoplankton and on the abundance and
              reproduction of the zooplankton.  Data on some species of fish are available
              from State agencies and University studies.    2. Characterizing the chemical
              content of the streams entering Lake Washington, and relating it to the degree
              of development in the drainage areas.  Samples are taken along streams above
              and below developed and undeveloped areas and places where developments are
              planned.  These schedules are repeated at intervals during varied conditions of
              stream flow and weather.  The area of land developed at different times in the
              past in each drainage area is being determined by analysis of aerial
              photographs.  The data will be related to known chemical changes in the
              streams.
