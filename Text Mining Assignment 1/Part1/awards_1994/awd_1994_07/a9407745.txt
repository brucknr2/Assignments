Abstract    :
              940774  Sandhu     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
              project will develop higher  sensitivity of liquid-crystal based ultrasound
              (acoustic) detectors.  Low sensitivity has been a factor limiting industrial
              applications of acousto-optical displays as well as limiting medical
              applications.  Phase I new liquid crystal systems were studied and found to
              improve detection sensitivity by one order of magnitude and more.    Phase II
              development is expected to add another one or two orders-of-magnitude
              improvement and to build a prototype system for further investigations of
              medical and industrial applications, e.g., breast imaging for cancer detection
              and nondestructive inspection of industrial materials.
