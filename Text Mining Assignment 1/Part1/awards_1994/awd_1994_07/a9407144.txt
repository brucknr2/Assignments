Abstract    :
              9407144  Campbell       The main purpose of this research is to test models for
              the  maintenance of plant hybrid zones.  Clines along hybrid zones can  be
              explained by several mechanisms that differ in the form of  selection.  Direct
              tests of these models will be conducted in a  hybrid zone between 2 flowering
              plants, Ipomopsis aggregata and I.  tenuituba.  The study has two major goals. 
              The first goal is to  characterize the overall form of selection to distinguish
              among the  proposed models.  Controlled crosses will be used to produce hybrid 
              seed, followed by reciprocal transplants to determine relative  fitness of
              parental species and offspring hybrids at several sites  along the hybrid zone.
               The second goal is to determine the form  and mechanism of selection directly
              on those floral traits that  exhibit clines.  Quantitative, molecular and
              observational methods  will be used to address this second goal.
