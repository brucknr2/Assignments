Abstract    :
              9407704  BERMAN    The project will study the organization of telomeres in 
              Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  Fluorescence in situ  hybridization experiments will
              be done to visualize the  positions of telomere DNA and nuclear proteins which 
              interact with this DNA.  Mutant strains of the yeast with  aberrant telomere
              structures will then be used to identify  roles for individual components of
              the telomere complex.  The investigators have already identified mutations in
              four  different genes which impact telomere function.  The  principal activity
              supported by this award is the immuno-  microscopic visualization of the
              telomere interactions with  nuclear proteins.  %%%  The ends of chromosomes are
              termed telomeres.  They have  unique properties and can dramatically impact the
              stability  of chromosomes.  The DNA in a telomere is known to have a  well
              defined, repeating pattern which facilitates its  replication. Interaction of
              this DNA with a variety of  proteins found in the nucleus of the cell is also
              critical  for proper chromosome behavior.   These interactions have  not been
              characterized to the extent that we understand what  they are and how they
              work.  Previous work has focused on  genetic and biochemical investigations of
              these questions.  This project will extend this work to examine, at the 
              microscopic level, what happens in living cells where  telomere function has
              been disrupted by mutations.  ***
