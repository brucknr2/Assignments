Abstract    :
                This action fulds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship.    These
              studies examine the role of opioid receptors in the induction of late genes
              during long-term potentiation (LTP) at the hippocampal mossy fiber-CA3 synapse.
               LTP is a relatively long-lasting increase in synaptic efficiency resulting
              from brief, high frequency stimulation of afferent fibers and is widely
              accepted as a candidate mechanism for learning and memory in mammals.  LTP at
              the mossy fiber-CA 3 synapse of the hippocampus depends on the activation of
              opioid receptors, requiring protein synthesis and gene expression.  It is
              hypothesized that late acting genes play important roles in maintenance of LTP
              and in learning and memory.  This research directly tests this hypothesis by
              determining the effects of opioid antagonists and peptide agonists, by
              disrupting translation of hippocampal late genes, by examining animals with
              disrupted late genes, and determining changes in performance in learning and
              memory tasks.  The role of new gene expression in synaptic plasticity and in
              higher physiological processes will be determined.
