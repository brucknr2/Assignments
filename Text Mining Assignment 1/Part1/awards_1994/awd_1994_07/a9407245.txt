Abstract    :
              9407245  The work proposed here will involve the study of conductance  anomalies
              in point contact, superconducting island and  superconducting to insulating
              transition in metallic films.  The work related to point contacts is very
              closely tied to  the experiments at Cornell.  The work on superconducting 
              islands focusses on understanding the even vs. odd number  of electrons in
              superconducting rodes and is motivated by   the experimental observation that
              the properties of these  systems depend upon whether the number of electrons is
               odd or even.  The proposed work will develop a microscopic  theory of
              superconducting to insulating transition analogous  to the Anderson theory of
              localization.  %%%  The proposed research is to provide a fundamental
              understanding  of some unusual properties of point contacts and superconducting
               rodes and is motivated by experiments in these systems.  The  work will also
              focus on developing a microscopic theory of  superconducting to insulating
              transition, which is one of  the important unsolved problems in theoretical
              condensed matter  physics.
