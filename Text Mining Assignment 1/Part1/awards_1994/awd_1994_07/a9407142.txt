Abstract    :
                While recent years have seen remarkable progress in   programming, both
              theoretically and practically, most of that    progress has come  in the
              solution of pure 0/1 problems.  On  the other hand,   mixed problems,  problems
              with both continuous  and discrete variables--  usually 0/1 
              variables--dominate in  practice;  moreover, practitioners   regularly produce 
              instances of these models that cannot be solved using   currently  available 
              codes.    This combination of success in solving pure 0/1   problems and the 
              existing demand for methods to solve difficult real-world   mixed  problems has
               received considerable attention in the research  community.    Nevertheless, 
              general-purpose mixed-integer solvers  remain primarily   solvers, and while
              they often  employ rather sophisticated   ``heuristic'' devices,  they still
              use  few of the algorithmic ideas implicit in   recent theoretical 
              developments.  This research will attempt to change that    situation by 
              developing a research code including both the  standard   methods that have
              been  successful in practice, as well  as incorporating ideas based   upon
              recent  theoretical  developments.  The focus will be on actually   solving
              real-world  instances that arise as general mixed integer programs but   cannot
               currently be  solved.
