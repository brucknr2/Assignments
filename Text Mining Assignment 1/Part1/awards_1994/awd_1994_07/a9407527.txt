Abstract    :
              ***    Fetterman    Excepting for sundials and a few other analog devices, to 
              time is to count.  This is because the counting of events-  -even random
              events--can yield very accurate estimates of  time.  It is not surprising,
              therefore, that major  theories of timing by biological systems posit timers
              that  work by accumulating (counting) events generated by some  kind of
              biological pacemaker.    Dr. J. Gregor Fetterman, in collaboration with Dr.
              Peter  R. Killeen, of Arizona State University, is examining how  variation
              (error) in the pacemaker and in the accumulator  contribute to timing by such
              clock-accumulator systems--  the pacemaker and the counter.  They are
              exploiting the  intimate relation of timing to counting by studying  parallel
              experimental tasks in each domain.  They search  for invariances in the system
              under a variety of tasks  that require temporal perception and discrimination. 
              They  will embed these findings in a general model of clock-  counter error.   
              Because of the key role of timing in all types of  behavior, the results of
              this research will contribute  importantly to our understanding of the
              fundamental  mechanisms of behavior.    ***
