Abstract    :
                     9407783  Murphy   This project involves the collaborative research of a
              US cultural  anthropologist and student and a Mexican Anthropologist and 
              student, studying the development of the potable water system for  the city of
              Oaxaca.  The project will examine documents in the  city archives to trace the
              social history of the water system in  this developing city, which is the state
              capital of the state of  Oaxaca, a relatively poor, backwards state in southern
              Mexico.  The project will document the historical development of the water 
              system, focusing on the political and economic aspects of the  decisions to
              construct the first modern water plant in the 1930s,  and trace the demographic
              processes that have led to the current  situation of water crisis in terms of
              quality (prior studies have  shown that the "best" water delivered for potable
              uses by the  current municipal system would be too polluted to be used in 
              swimming pools in developed countries) and quantity (the annual  dry seasons
              bring shortages and service interruptions each year).        This project is
              important because understanding the patterns  of development of the basic
              municipal service of potable water in  depth, in one place, is valuable to
              understand patterns of grown  in municipal services in the developing world in
              general.  In  addition this project involves international collaboration 
              between US and Mexican scholars which will strengthen ties  between the two
              countries.
