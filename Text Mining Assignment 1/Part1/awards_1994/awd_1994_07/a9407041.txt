Abstract    :
              9407041  MADDOCKS       It is proposed to investigate recent progress in 
              advanced  theoretical dynamics within the context of the practical  mechanics
              problems that arise in the determination and  control of  the attitude dynamics
              of artificial satellites.  The  proposal is  jointly sponsored by the
              University of Maryland College Park  and  Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC). 
              The underlying  motivation  is that a postdoctoral associate could facilitate
              and  exploit a  two-way transfer of technology in which the modern  analytical
              and  numerical expertise that is available in the University, is  tested in the
              light of the expertise available at CSC,  namely an  extensive knowledged of
              traditional mechanics approaches,  and of  practical questions that arise in
              flying satellites.  The  project  will comprise case studies of specific
              operational  satellites and  comparison with actual flight data.  The
              mathematical  techniques  that will be considered include applications of i)
              the non-  canonical Hamiltonian formulation of Arnol'd to predict so-  called 
              gravity-gradient and other perturbation effects on the  attitude  dynamics of
              satellites, ii) modern Hamiltonian formulations  of  rod models to describe the
              dynamics of antennas and booms,  and  iii) applications of symplectic and
              energy-momentum  integrator in  high accuracy numerical simulations.  The
              associated  physical  effects to be investigated will include i) coupling
              between  attitude and orbit dynamics due to finite satellite size,  and 
              internal and external damping, ii) spin-up dynamics and  instability
              resonances, and especially iii) effects of  flexibility of satellites.  The
              final objective is improved  understanding of the attitude dynamics of
              satellites that  will  lead to robust, efficient and accurate numerical 
              simulations.
