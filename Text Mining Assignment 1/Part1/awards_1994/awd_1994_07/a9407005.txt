Abstract    :
              Weber  9407005   This study will investigate the genes that control the growth
              of localized groups of cells during the growth of organisms, to produce the
              final shapes and proportions of specific parts in the adult.  The project will
              study these genes by using many replicated measurements of the proportions of
              wings in Drosophila melanogaster (the common fruit fly), combined with methods
              of marking and identifying chromosome regions so that the effect of each region
              on the adult wing shape can be distinguished from effects of other chromosome
              regions.  By this approach, a complete map of the chromosomes will be
              assembled, showing the locations of the genes which control the shape of the
              wing.  This information will help to guide the search for specific DNA
              sequences with well-defined localized effects on shape.  Since many basic
              genetic discoveries with applicability to humans have been made using
              Drosophila, this investigation may also shed light on how genes control form in
              humans.  The wing of the fruit fly provides ideal material for such studies,
              because it can easily be projected like a slide to give highly magnified image
              on a large computerized measuring pad.
