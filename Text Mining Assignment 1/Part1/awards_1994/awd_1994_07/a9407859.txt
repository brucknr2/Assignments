Abstract    :
              9407859  Stein     This project examines the trophic cascade hypothesis in
              lower-latitude US reservoirs, where the dominant paradigm of top-down or
              bottom-up trophic controls may not hold.  Specifically, gizzard shad appear to
              neither be controlled by fish predators nor by their zooplankton prey.  The
              investigators hypothesize that the shad themselves regulate community
              composition.  This research will test this idea by examining larval
              shad-bluegill interactions in eight reservoirs in Ohio and Alabama.  The
              investigators will also conduct experiments on zooplankton and larval shad
              productivity, and develop models of these trophic interactions.      This
              research will extend the current understanding of ecosystem control and
              community structure, yielding a more general understanding of the dynamics of
              food webs.  The results of this research have applications in the management of
              fish stocks, reservoir management, and conservation biology.
