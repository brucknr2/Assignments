Abstract    :
              9407769  Handa     Steroid hormones are key modulators of the intracellular 
              communications network used by the nervous system.  These simple  hormones
              potentially influence virtually all neural functions,  from the organization of
              neural circuits during development to  the activity of individual synapses of
              adults.  The circuits  affected by steroid hormones include those involved in 
              neuroendocrine physiology, reproductive behaviors, and non-  reproductive
              behaviors such as emotion, aggression, feeding, and  learning and memory.  This
              action is to provide support for a  Young Investigator Symposium to be held at
              the 1994 Workshop on  Steroid Hormones and Brain Function in Breckenridge,
              Colorado on  April 1-5, 1994.  This workshop brings together scientists using 
              different approaches to address important and timely issues  concerning steroid
              regulation of brain function.  Molecular  biologists, neuroanatomists,
              neurophysiologists and behaviorists  will be examining such issues as sexual
              differentiation of the  brain, neuroplasticity and steroid action, and
              alternative  mechanisms of action.  These are fundamentally important 
              questions in an field that is rapidly advancing and changing.   The format of
              the workshop and the inclusion of a Young  Investigator Symposium provide the
              appropriate mechanism to  nurture young talent and facilitate collaborative
              efforts that  may significantly enhance our understanding of the basic 
              neurobiological mechanisms where steroid hormones can affect  various neural
              systems.    ***
