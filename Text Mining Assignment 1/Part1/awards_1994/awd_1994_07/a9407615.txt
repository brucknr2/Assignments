Abstract    :
              9407615  Bronstein     The study of mutualism has lagged behind the study of
              other interactions between organisms.  Several features of mutualism, notably
              the inherent conflicts of interests between mutualists, suggest that these
              interactions may be easily perturbed and unstable.  Yet mutualisms are
              important and common relationships in most ecosystems.  This project attempts
              to test some new ideas about how mutualisms persist successfully in nature. 
              Specifically, the PI's will test the idea that mutualists' fates are linked by
              extrinsic factors that simultaneously limit both partners' success, and that
              this variance often cancels out the inherent conflict between mutualists.  The
              study system used is the relationship between figs and fig wasps.    This
              research will improve our understanding of the ecology of mutualisms and
              elucidate the role of extrinsic factors in creating stability in otherwise
              inherently unstable systems.  The results may have application in conservation
              biology, including the design and management nature reserves, and in
              agricultural pollination.
