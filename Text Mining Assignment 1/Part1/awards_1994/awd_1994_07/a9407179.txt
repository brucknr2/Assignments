Abstract    :
              9407179  Burns                            ABSTRACT                              
                                                 The activity of the enzyme pectinesterase in
              fresh-squeezed  citrus juice greatly decreases the quality of the product. 
              Because of its action on juice components, pectinesterase  causes cloud loss in
              citrus juice.  Presently, higher  temperature pasteurization, above what is
              necessary for  microbial control, is used commercially to reduce the  activity
              of the enzyme.  However, after pasteurization,  residual pectinesterase
              activity persists, and flavor is  negatively affected.  Exploring alternative
              methods of  pectinesterase control would be of major benefit in  improving the
              quality of this valuable product.  Dr. Burns  is seeking to apply recent
              advances in recombinant DNA  technology to substantially reduce the enzyme in
              citrus  juice.
