Abstract    :
              9407738  Healey      The main focus of the proposed work will be the analysis of
               partial differential equations with symmetry in connection with  applications
              to elastomechanics. The latter will involve  geometrically exact formulations
              of nonlinearly elastic and  visco-elastic solids and structures. The proposed
              wrk has three  essential goals: (i) to obtain new qualitative results and
              detect  new phenomena; (ii) to obtain global continuation results for  problems
              of 2 and 3-dimensional elasticity; (iii) to further  pursue and exploit the
              connection between symmetry and nodal  properties in global bifurcation
              problems for elliptic equations.   This work has several potential applications
              to "real-world"  engineering problems. First, the occurence of symmetric 
              structures in engineering practice is ubiquitous - due in part to  esthetics,
              and in part to optimal load-carrying capacity  (typically based upon linear
              analyses). However, such structures  are also susceptible to symmetry-breaking
              instabilities. The  fruits of this research will help to provide a systematic 
              approach to the (necessarily nonlinear) analysis of such  instabilities.
              Second, a qualitative nonlinear analysis of a  concrete class of problems,
              parameterized by general constitutive  laws, often illuminates the specific
              roles of material behavior  inattaining thresholds of instability. In this way
              we are able to  classify material behavior with an eye toward engineering
              design  of structures.
