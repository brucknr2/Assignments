Abstract    :
              9407273  Grimson    This award, in the Small Grants for Exploratory Research
              mode,  provides limited funding for a one-year probe to explore the  research
              needed to enable creation of a complete, integrated  vision-based robot system
              that will reliably and autonomously  perform vision, navigation, and simple
              manipulation tasks. The goal  is to determine if this can be achieved with very
              inexpensive  components, yet support a range of low and high level vision tasks
               with a long lifetime.  If this can be achieved, then the results  should lead
              to a low-cost, high-capability platform which could be  easily  duplicated for
              use by other research institutions.  It will  develop a radically new
              generation of embedded vision hardware and  active vision software.
