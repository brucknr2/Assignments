Abstract    :
              9407080  Grabowski  Univ. of Pittsburgh  The mechanisms of prototypical ionic
              gas-phase  reactions will be studied and key and/or unusual reactive
              intermediates will be characterized by gas-phase ion-molecule techniques. The
              proposed work has two major thrusts, both of which focus on the chemistry of
              gas-phase anions. The first part will be directed to bimolecular substitution
              (SN2) reactions at non-carbon first row elements. For example, in this
              category, SN2 reactions on the oxygen atom in peroxides will be studied. In
              addition, substitution reactions on nitrogen, fluorine, and chlorine will be
              pursued. The second part will be directed to a study of distonic radical
              anions. These newly discovered species have the radical and anionic sites
              separated on different atoms in the molecule. A number of new synthetic routes
              to distonic radical anions will be developed and the reactivity of these
              species will be investigated.    This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program
              supports the work of Professor Joseph J. Grabowski at the University of
              Pittsburgh. The detailed steps (or mechanisms) of ionic reactions in the
              gas-phase will be studied by specialized techniques. These reactions can be
              compared to those carried out in solution in order to determine the effect of
              solvent, which has a profound effect on the reaction. The reaction of an
              anionic species at oxygen, nitrogen, fluorine, and chlorine atoms in molecules
              will be investigated. In addition, the synthesis and reactions of distonic
              anions, a new type of species, will be pursued. These novel species have one
              unit of negative charge and one non-bonded electron on different atoms.
