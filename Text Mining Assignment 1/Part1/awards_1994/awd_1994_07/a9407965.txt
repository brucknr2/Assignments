Abstract    :
              9407965   ORZACK   This is a study of two species of wasp, Nasonia giraulti and
              N. vitripennis. Females of these species, like those of many other Hymenoptera
              (ants, bees, and wasps), often produce more female than male offspring in their
              broods. One common explanation for such an excess (known as a female-biased sex
              ratio) is that it has evolved as a response to geographical subdivision of the
              population. However, there is no reliable information about population
              subdivision in these species (and many others like them). This study will
              provide such information. For both species, DNA sequences from individuals will
              be compared. The degree to which these sequences differ within and among
              localities will reveal whether these species have subdivided populations which
              will lead to the evolution of female-biased sex ratios. In addition, females
              will be compared to   determine whether they differ in regard to the set of sex
              ratios they produce when producing offspring in the presence of varying numbers
              of other females.       This study will also assess whether the number and kind
              of DNA sequence differences among individuals are accounted for by the theory
              that such differences are not affected by natural selection.
