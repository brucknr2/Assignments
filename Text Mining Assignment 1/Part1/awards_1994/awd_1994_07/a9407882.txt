Abstract    :
              A new program of research in computational gravitation will  be initiated.  Dr.
              Seidel's group will use supercomputers to  study the Einstein equations
              describing axisymmetric black  hole spacetimes.  A numerical code to solve
              these equations  for rotating black holes has been developed by this group, 
              and will be used to study the evolution of distorted,  rotating black holes,
              and black holes in collision.  Waveforms of gravitational radiation emitted by
              these black  holes will be calculated.  The black hole horizons in these 
              spacetimes will also be studied.  This work will lead to a better understanding
              of black  holes, which will be an important source of gravitational  waves that
              may be observable by a new generation of wave  detectors (LIGO and VIRGO) under
              development.  This work  will be particularly important in understanding the 
              nonlinear dynamics of rotating black holes, which have never  been studied
              before in detail.  This axisymmetric work will  also provide an important
              testbed for full 3D simulations  that will be performed in the future.
