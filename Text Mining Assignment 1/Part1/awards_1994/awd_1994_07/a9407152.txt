Abstract    :
              9407152  Dillon    Encyclopedic collections housed in museums continue to be
              central to modern research in systematic botany.  As methods of analysis become
              more sophisticated, the community's use of well-annotated, systematically and
              geographically organized voucher collections will continue to expand.  The
              botanical collections at Field Museum include over 2 million flowering plant
              accessions and represent a sampling of biodiversity with worldwide
              representation.  The bulk of these collections (64.5%) are from Latin American,
              and particularly Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, Costa Rica, Peru and Brazil, and
              as the pace of biodiversity loss in the Neotropics continues to accelerate, the
              information provided by these collections is increasingly valuable in
              conservation efforts.    Since its inception, Field Museum's Department of
              Botany has maintained significant collection-based services to the botanical
              community.  Especially important is a massive loan program with a current
              volume of 30-40,000 sheets per year in outgoing and incoming material.  The
              selection, repair, packaging, and invoicing of loans is an extremely
              labor-intensive operation.  To insure the uninterrupted and consistently prompt
              attentions to loan requests from the scientific community.    This project will
              provide a full-time Collections Assistant devoted to assisting with the
              specimen loan program, including shipping/receiving loans, packing/unpacking
              loans, fumigating incoming loan material, generating and updating invoices and
              computer records, filing loans.
