Abstract    :
                   A wide variety of hydrocarbons are emitted into the atmosphere  from both
              natural and anthropogenic sources.  Isoprene (2-methyl-  1,3-butadiene) is of
              particular interest because it has the largest  global flux of any single
              hydrocarbon species with the possible  exception of methane,  Isoprene reacts
              rapidly with hydroxyl  radical (OH) and ozone (O3) in the presence of NOx
              forming   3-buten-2 one( methyl vinyl ketone, MVK) and 2-methyl-2-propenal 
              (methacrolein, MACR).  Once formed, tropospheric MVK and MACR, as  well as many
              other hydrocarbon oxidation products, may undergo a  variety of reactions in
              the gas phase.       It is likely that MVK, MACR and other hydrocarbon
              oxidation  products can also partition into atmospheric water drops and 
              undergo subsequent aqueous-phase reactions leading to the formation  of peroxyl
              radicals (HO2/RO2) and other oxidant species, and there  by, consuming MVK and
              MACR.  Peroxyl radicals can destroy  tropospheric O3 and form  peroxides that
              rapidly oxidize sulfur  dioxide (SO2) in the aqueous phase.  The sulfate
              aerosol that is  subsequently formed efficiently backscatters incoming solar 
              radiation and exerts a significant cooling effect upon climate.       These
              researchers therefore will study: 1) partitioning of  MVK, MACR and other
              hydrocarbon oxidation products from the gas  phase into water, 2) aqueous-phase
              photochemistry of MVK, MACR, and  other hydrocarbon oxidation products under
              conditions that are  typical of atmospheric water drops, and 3) aqueous-phase
              reactions  of MVK, MACR and other hydrocarbon oxidation products with selected 
              photochemical oxidants.
