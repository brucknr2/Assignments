Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry   Division,
              Prof. Anne B. Myers of the University of Rochester will   investigate the
              dynamics of electronic states and electronic coherences   of small molecules in
              the condensed phase.  Specifically, electronic   dephasing and solvation are to
              be studied using ground-state resonance   Raman spectroscopy and three-pulse
              photon echo measurements.  The systems   to be studied include carbon disulfide
              in a variety of polar and   non-polar liquid solvents, the triatomic iodine ion
              in polar solvents,   and azulene in glassy polymers.  From the electronic
              absorption spectra,   Raman excitation profiles, and the absolute Raman quantum
              yields as a   function of the excitation frequency broadening processes that
              are fast   and slow on the Raman time scale will be deduced.  The three-pulse
              photon   echo experiment provides similar information for comparison to the
              Raman   results.    These investigations will provide insight to the processes
              that are   responsible for the broadening of electronic absorptions in
              condensed   media and to  processes that affect chemical reaction rates in
              condensed   phases.  Efforts to develop practical optical memories based on  
              persistent spectral hole burning in solids will be aided by a better  
              understanding brought about by these researches.
