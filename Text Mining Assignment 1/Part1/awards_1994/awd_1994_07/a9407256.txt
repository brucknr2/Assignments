Abstract    :
              9407256  Kunzelman  The objective of this Planning Grant is to allow for further
               study to characterize the biomechanical behavior of the mitral  valve in
              health, disease, and after surgical repair.  To meet  this objective, the
              mechanical behavior of the tissue must be  first determined based on its
              microstructure, and then integrated  into a finite element model of the valve. 
              The specific aims are  to: (1) determine whether there is a difference between
              the  biaxial mechanical properties of normal and diseased mitral valve  tissue,
              (2) determine whether there is a difference in  microstructurreal makeup
              between normal and diseased mitral valve  tissue, (3) determine whether there
              is a relationship between  biaxial mechanical properties and microstructural
              makeup, and (4)  analyze the effect of diseased tissue properties on overall 
              mitral valve function.  ***
