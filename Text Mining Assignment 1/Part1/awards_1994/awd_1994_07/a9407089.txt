Abstract    :
              9407089    This renewal award is made in the Advanced Materials and  Processing
              Program in support of the research of Professors  Mark Hampden-Smith and Toivo
              Kodas.  Support is provided by the  Divisions of Chemistry, Materials Research,
              and Chemical and  Transport Systems. Two fundamental problems in metal chemical
               vapor deposition (CVD) will be addressed: (1) methods of  providing
              reproducible delivery for precursors with low  volatility, and (2) developing
              methods to control selective  metal deposition. Low volatility silver(I)
              precursors will be  prepared and their CVD studied using a aerosol delivery
              system  which will allow studies of reaction kinetics in partial  pressure
              ranges that cannot be achieved with conventional  thermal delivery systems.
              Studies of surface chemistry will be  aimed at understanding how copper(I)
              precursor molecules react  with surface functional groups on silica, alumina,
              titania, and  silicon and aluminum nitride surfaces. These interactions will 
              be characterized by FTIR, XPS and temperature-programmed  desorption-MS.
              Surfaces will be modified to control the  selective deposition of copper and
              silver metals.    This research is relevant to semiconductor technology. Copper
               will likely replace aluminum as an interconnect for high  resolution chips.
              This research will provide the fundamental  background for
              electromigration-resistant metal deposition.
