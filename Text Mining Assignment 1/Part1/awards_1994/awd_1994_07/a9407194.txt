Abstract    :
              9407194  Langer       The Institute for Theoretical Physics will continue its
              very  broad and unique effort.  The Institute promotes research in  theoretical
              physics with a particular emphasis, when appropriate,  on problems that cut
              across the traditional subfields of physics.  Its main activities are long term
              research programs which  typically run five to six months.  These programs
              bring together  diverse groups of theoretical physicists and other scientists
              to  work in research areas that are especially timely, important, and 
              intellectually challenging.  Two programs operate in parallel at  any one time,
              each with approximately fifteen physicists in  residence.  The topics of the
              programs, which have spanned the  entire gamut of theoretical physics, are
              usually an outgrowth of  suggestions from the national and international
              theoretical  physics community.  Most program coordinators are from outside 
              the Institute, although the permanent members often play a major  role in these
              activities.  In addition, the Institute conducts an  average of six conferences
              or workshops per year, most of which  are associated with the long term
              programs.       The Institute's effort will foster the health of theoretical 
              physics generally, and permit particularly effective research on 
              cross-subfield problems.  ***
