Abstract    :
              9407027  Pinto    Specimens of Trichogramma at the University of California at
              Riverside presently mounted in Hoyer's will be transferred to Canada balsam
              mounts.  Limited materials now in alcohol or gelatin capsules will also be
              mounted in Canada balsam.  That will make this highly valuable collection of
              parasitoids amenable to study.
