Abstract    :
              9407268  Ablon   This project supports the research of a cultural anthropologist
              from   the   University of California studying people and families impacted by
              a disease called   Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI), also called "brittle bone
              disease".   This is a genetic   disease  which causes extremely fragile bones. 
              Treatment sometimes involves drilling   out the long bones and inserting rods
              to strengthen the limbs.  The researcher will   interview in depth a sample of
              individuals affected by the disease, about their life   histories, coping
              strategies, and self images.  The investigator will also observe   interactions
              at OI Foundation meetings.  The analysis will describe the existential issues  
              involved in growing up in a body so fragile that bones can be broken simply by
              swinging   one's leg; specifically how one develops a concept of intimacy when
              even slight physical   touching can break bones.  The nature of family
              adaptations to having a member with OI   will be described, as well as social
              stereotypes and psychological consequences of   childhood spent undergoing
              extensive often painful medical procedures.   This research is important
              because it will help us understand the nature of stigma,   physical disability,
              body self-images, chronic illness, and genetic diseases by providing   an
              extensive and careful case study of a population who can not take for granted
              the   physical protection of their own skeletal systems, and who must organize
              their daily lives   around physical fragility.  Knowing how sufferers from this
              extreme condition cope and   establish their lives will be useful to everyone
              who experiences  similar disabilities.
