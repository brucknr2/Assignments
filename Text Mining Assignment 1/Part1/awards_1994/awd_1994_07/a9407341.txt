Abstract    :
              9407341  Smith    This project involves the dissertation research of a cultural 
               anthropology student from the University of California-Davis.  The   student
              will do a case study of one Native American community museum,   study a
              conference of museum professionals, study the dominant national   institution
              (the Smithsonian Institution), and conduct a survey of   Native American
              museums, in order to study how Native Americans defend   their own definition
              of "ethnicity" and culture against national   influences.  The questions to be
              asked have to do with whether   Native American museums can play dynamic roles
              in relation to living   culture of Native American communities, or whether they
              treat their   culture as historic relics not relevant to contemporary life.    
                 This research is important because the tension between local   minority
              cultures and the national majority culture is a fact of life   relevant to all
              nation states.  Increased understanding of how local   cultures defend their
              own interests and maintain their cultural   distinctiveness while at the same
              time interacting with national   political institutions will help planners
              design programs which can   productively satisfy both local and national
              cultural and political   concerns.
