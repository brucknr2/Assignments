Abstract    :
              9407724  Gurol  This is an award to support research on a potential water 
              treatment process using hydrogen peroxide in the presence of iron  oxide
              catalysts to oxidize organic substances of hazardous  significance that may be
              present in water or produced during its  disinfection by use of chlorine.  The
              research involves  determination of the mechanisms and rates of oxidation of
              the  target compounds, trichloroethylene and monochlorobenzene in  continuous
              flow and in batch processing modes of operating slurry  reactors in which the
              reactions take place.  A conceptual model  of the process will be
              experimentally evaluated for its  predictive capability.  The investigator also
              plans on exploring  the potential use of the concept in a filtration process
              where  the iron catalyst is present as a coating on the water filter  media.   
               Presence of organic substances in surface and groundwaters may  result in the
              production of potentially hazardous compounds when  chlorine is used to
              disinfect the water.  The research being  conducted in this project is expected
              to result in determination  of parameters for use in engineering design of
              water treatment  processes to destroy these compounds.  Results may also be 
              applicable in engineering design of systems for remediation of  groundwater
              that has been contaminated by chlorinated organic  compounds.  ***
