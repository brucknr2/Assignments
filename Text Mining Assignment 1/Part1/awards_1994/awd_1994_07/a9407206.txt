Abstract    :
              IBN-9407206  Edmund Fantino    This is a study of choice behavior and
              conditioned reinforcement. Dr.  Fantino has developed a very well-known theory,
              called the Delay  Reduction Theory, that will be refined and tested in several
              experiments.  According to the theory, the effectiveness of a particular
              stimulus as a  conditioned reinforcer may be predicted most accurately by
              calculating the  reduction in the duration of time between the onset of the
              preceding  stimulus and the primary reinforcement. This theory has wide
              application  in several important areas, including foraging behavior, memory
              and self-  control. The experiments to be done will refine the theory and
              extend it to  new areas. For example, Dr. Fantino will investigate whether the
              theory can  be extended to situations where the reward is uncertain or risky.
              The results  of these experiments are relevant to several issues in learning
              and  motivation.
