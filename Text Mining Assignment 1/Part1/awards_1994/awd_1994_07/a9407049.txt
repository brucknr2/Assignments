Abstract    :
              9407049  Blackstone         Much of the theory and data of modern evolutionary 
              biology converges on two related subjects: the evolution of  development and
              the evolution of life history. Curiously,  these subjects have remained
              conceptually and operationally  distinct-studies of the former focus on
              evolutionary changes  in the timing of organismal development and on the 
              morphological manifestations of this process (e.g., size,  presence of
              juvenilized, adult or derived features), while  studies of the later focus on
              the organism's allocation of  energy into various life history traits (e.g.,
              size, timing  of reproduction, number of offspring).      To unite studies of
              life history and the evolution of  development conceptually, it is necessary to
              elucidate a  mechanistic link between energy allocation and the timing of 
              development. In particular, efforts must be made to identify  an appropriate
              organismal system which can illuminate the  withinorganism mechanisms mediating
              the connection between  energy allocation and the timing of developmental and
              life  history traits. This system must show correlations (1) in  natural
              populations between variation of the putative  mechanism and the observed
              variation of life history and  development, and (2) in laboratory populations
              between  experimental perturbation of the putative mechanism and  variation
              which mimics the naturally occurring variation.       Recent studies of
              colonial marine hydroids suggest that  within-colony circulation serves as a
              mechanism by which  energy allocation mediates the timing of morphological and 
              life history traits. The PI proposes to initiate a research  program which will
              establish, for the first time, how  ecological variation in life histories is
              linked to  evolutionary changes in the timing of development.  ***
