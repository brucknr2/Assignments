Abstract    :
              9407968  Pearson                              ABSTRACT                          
                                                                                     A
              quantitative investigation of the physiological and  behavioral responses of
              females of two moth species is  proposed.  The species are the grape root borer
              (Vitacea  polistiformis Harris) and the squash vine borer (Melittia  cucurbitae
              Harris), both members of the lepidopteran Family  Sesiidae.  The two species
              under investigation are the first  insects to have female responses to
              synthetic pheromones  documented in the field.  Changes in female behavior
              under  pheromone treatments have been postulated as a new mechanism  for
              resistance to mating disruption.  If altered female  behavior under pheromone
              treatments increases the  probability of mating, and if these behavior changes
              are  heritable, a potential disruption resistance selection may  exist. 
              Sesiids are unique in that they have highly similar  pheromone blends, and
              cross species attraction is known.  Thus, the proposed research also has
              evolutionary interest  relating to questions of reproductive isolation and 
              evolution of mating systems.  Lastly, both insects under  investigation are
              serious plant pests that are not  controlled by either chemical or biological
              controls in  North Carolina or other areas on the East Coast.  Mating 
              disruption may be the only method by which to achieve a  satisfactory level of
              control can be achieved in the  Southeastern United States.
