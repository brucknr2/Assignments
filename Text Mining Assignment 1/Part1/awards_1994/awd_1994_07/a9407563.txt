Abstract    :
              This research focuses on behavior of the solvent to understand nucleation,
              cluster formation, and solute-solvent structure in aqueous supersaturated sugar
              solutions and the relationship of these to crystal nucleation and growth. 
              Fluorescent probes at very low concentrations will be utilized for this
              purpose.  The "tailor-made" probes are to contain sugar moieties to ensure
              their participation in solute aggregation phenomena.  Bulk nucleation
              experiments will be conducted with the fluorophores as probes of glucose and
              sucrose crystallization.
