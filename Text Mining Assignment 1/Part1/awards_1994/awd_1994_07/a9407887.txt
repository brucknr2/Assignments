Abstract    :
              9407887  Dubin                              ABSTRACT                            
                                                                                   The major
              aim of this research is to identify mechanisms  underlying olfactory
              transduction in receptor neurons of a  simple animal (Drosophila melanogaster)
              with the long-term  goal of understanding how odorant-induced changes in 
              cellular excitability encode information which  can be  processed by higher
              order cells.  The proposed experiments  will combine for the first time the
              genetic variability of  Drosophila melanogaster with whole cell and single
              channel  electrophysiological analyses to study odorant-modulated ion  channel
              function and cellular excitability in wild type  flies.  The molecular nature
              of these modulated conductances  and second messenger pathways will be
              investigated using  mutants with known defects in genes encoding ion channels 
              and enzymes involved in signal transduction processes.  Furthermore, a number
              of mutants defective in olfaction  derived from enhancer trap lines with
              predominant olfactory  neuron staining will be studied at the receptor cell
              level  to examine the physiological site of the defects.
