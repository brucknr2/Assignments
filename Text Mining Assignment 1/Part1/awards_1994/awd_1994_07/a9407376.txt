Abstract    :
              9407376  Skafar    The proposed research will investigate the mechanism of 
              action of the steroid hormones estrogen and progesterone.  The research will
              use quantitative studies of the equilibria  and kinetics of ligand-binding,
              dimerization, and the DNA-  binding properties of the estrogen and progesterone
               receptors.  Molecular biological techniques will be used to  construct
              receptors containing only the hormone-binding  regions, or the
              DNA+hormone-binding regions.  The ligand-  binding, dimerization and
              DNA-binding properties of these  constructs will be compared with those of the
              full-length  proteins.  In this way, the interactions between the  different
              domains of the receptors during the conformational  changes induced by
              ligand-binding can be dissected.  ***
