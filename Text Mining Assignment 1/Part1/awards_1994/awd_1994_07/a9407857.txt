Abstract    :
              9407857  Forster  This study addresses the patterns of historical
              diversification of the duck-billed dinosaurs, or Hadrosauridae.  This group of
              dinosaurs is not only the largest, but the most diverse and biogeographically
              widespread lineage of ornithischian dinosaurs of the Late Cretaceous period. 
              Hadrosaurids have a rich fossil history, and are among the best collected
              groups of dinosaurs with the best prepared specimens.  Their unique anatomical
              specializations, including elaborate features of the jaws, provide ample
              information for reconstructing their genealogical relationships.  No such
              reconstruction currently exists, and this proposal seeks to provide one.  This
              reconstruction will form the basis for exploring hypotheses about the history
              and biogeography of this important group of dinosaurs.
