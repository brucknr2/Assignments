Abstract    :
              In 1987, the Plant Resources Center which contains The University of Texas (TEX)
              and Lundell (LL) Herbaria was given 5000 square feet of new, renovated space to
              accommodate the growth engendered by the receipt of the remainder of the
              Lundell collection (60,000 specimens) and the Moldenke collection (6475
              specimens).  However, in addition to these collections, the PRC has grown by
              about 100,000 specimens  over the last five years.  The combined influx of the
              Lundell material and additional growth has now saturated all of the space
              provided by the University.  Beginning in 1994, the PRC will receive a large
              collection of 11,600 specimens from Dr. Paul Fryxell. The Fryxell material
              which consists primarily of Malvaceae will Compliment the collections in the
              PRC because the majority of the specimens are form Mexico and Latin America. 
              Dr. Fryxell plans to spend most of the year in Austin where he will continue
              his research and help curate the Malvales.  In addition, the PRC was given a
              notable collection of North American Yucca specimen (155 numbers) that it must
              sort, label, and mount.   This collection will ultimately be one of the most
              complete collections of North American Yucca in the World.  The University of
              Texas has shown its continued support for the PRC by providing another 3000
              square feet of space that it has agreed to renovate at a cost of $20,000.  In
              addition, beginning in the summer of 1994, the University has agreed to fund
              the equivalent of an additional full time position for the PRC.  The University
              cannot, however, provide cases for the space.  Funds will provide herbarium
              cases for the new floor and for one half-time graduate student Curatorial
              Assistant to incorporate the Fryxell collection,  help prepare the Yucca
              material, assist in shifting the herbarium, and make necessary additions to the
               type register.
