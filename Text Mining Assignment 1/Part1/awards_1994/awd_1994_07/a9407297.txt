Abstract    :
              9407297  Miller     Very little research has been conducted in the tropics at
              the whole-community level.  It is important to understand the role of keystone
              species in trophic and other interactions between tropical organisms.  This
              project addresses the role of fig trees as keystone species in New Guinean wet
              forests.  The goals are to 1) describe the insect herbivore faunas associated
              with ten local fig species and evaluate the food web connnections between these
              herbivores and other members of the forest community, 2) contrast the
              characteristics and community structure of associated herbivorous insects of
              keystone and non-keystone fig species, and 3) develop predictive abilities
              about the host-specificity and species richness of fig herbivores from easily
              measured host variables.    This research will improve our understanding of the
              function of tropical forest ecosystems.  The results will have application in
              conservation biology, especially in the design and management of tropical
              forest reserves.
