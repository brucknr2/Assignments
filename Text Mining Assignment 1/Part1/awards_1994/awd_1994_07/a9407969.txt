Abstract    :
              Kirkpatrick  9407969   This project will investigate the mechanisms for the
              diversification of mating displays and mating preferences between closely
              related species.  These traits are known to diversify at a very high rate and
              therefore represent a model system for studies of the factors responsible for
              behavioral differences both within and between the species.  The investigators
              will use mathematical models that describe genetic change in mating displays,
              mating preferences, and other traits that are genetically coupled to them.  
              Research will focus on three mechanisms: (1) direct survival effects of mating
              preferences (the "direct selection" hypothesis), (2) genetic coupling between
              traits that increase survival and mating preferences (the "good genes"
              hypothesis), and (3) mate choice copying.  Recent experimental data show that
              all three mechanisms influence preferences and displays, but have not evaluated
              their relative importance.  Mathematical models developed in this research
              program will use data to produce the first quantitative estimates of the
              relative impacts of these mechanisms.  Results will produce insights into the
              causes of behavioral variation and the processes of speciation.
