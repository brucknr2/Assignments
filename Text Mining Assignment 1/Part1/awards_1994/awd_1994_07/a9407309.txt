Abstract    :
              9407309  Schmidt  Arizona State Univ.  This theoretical study of Monte Carlo
              methods and applications is supported by the NSF Theoretical and Computational
              Chemistry Program.  Both variational and Greens Function Monte Carlo theory  is
              applied to the calculation of molecular electronic structure and to the study
              of structure and dynamics of floppy van der Waals clusters.  New methodological
              developments in Monte Carlo theory include: study of explicitly-correlated
              variational functions for electron correlation effects, use of Greengard's fast
              multipole method for numerical evaluation of electrostatic potentials,
              pseudopotentials for inner core electrons, modified fixed node methods, and the
              combination of Monte Carlo and density functional methods.  Both ground and
              excited states are treated.  In particular, the theory is applied to the
              calculation of spectral shifts for a diatomic or small aromatic molecule in a
              rare gas cluster.    Monte Carlo methods constitute a class of numerical
              methods for the approximate solution of differential equations using the
              concept of random walks through the many-dimensional physical space.  In this
              project, Monte Carlo methods are applied to the Schroedinger equation of
              electrons in atoms and molecules  to study electronic spectra and molecular
              structure.  These mathematical methods are also applied to the Schroedinger
              equation for the large amplitude motions of atoms in loosely bonded molecular
              clusters.
