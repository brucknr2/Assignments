Abstract    :
              IBN-9407267  Diane Matesic      This research will investigate a very novel idea
              proposed by this young scientist, Dr. Matesic. She has observed that there are
              increases in the connections (gap junctions) between cultured neurons
              containing an important hypothalamic hormone, luteinizing hormone releasing
              hormone (LHRH) when those cultured neurons are treated with chemicals known to
              increase the levels of an intracellular messenger molecule called cyclic AMP.
              LHRH-containing neurons in the hypothalamus secrete LHRH in a coordinated,
              pulsatile manner. The mechanisms that establish coordinated secretion of LHRH
              by these neurons are unknown. Dr. Matesic's idea is that electrotonic coupling
              via gap junctions located at points of interconnection between LHRH neurons may
              play a role in coordinated LHRH secretion. This is a novel idea and, therefore,
              support of preliminary research of this work is particularly critical. To do
              this work, Dr. Matesic is capitalizing on her training in gap junctional
              intercellular communication in rat liver cells to extend these ideas to the
              nervous system. This work will increase our understanding of the role of gap
              junctions in the coordinated activities between many types of neurons within
              the central nervous system.
