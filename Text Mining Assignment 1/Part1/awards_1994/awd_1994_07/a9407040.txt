Abstract    :
                This award funds a research planning workshop on object  representation in
              computer vision.  The workshop will be held on  November 2-4 at the City
              University of New York in New York City,  and will bring computer vision
              experts together to formulate a set  of proposed representational schemes and a
              methodology for  evaluating and comparing different approaches.  A report will
              be  produced for wide dissemination, which will contain a review of  existing
              research and recommendations for future research.  The  workshop is jointly
              funded with ARPA.  To enhance the educational  impact of the event, each
              participating institution will be invited  to send one student to the meeting.
