Abstract    :
              9407741  Pincus  This theoretical research will be carried out at both the 
              University of California at Santa Barbara and the University of  California at
              Los Angeles.  Analytical and simulational  investigations will be done on
              polymers which are soluble in  aqueous solvents because of hydrogen bond
              formation between the  solvent molecules and the moities on the chain, e.g.,
              oxygen on the  backbone of polyethylene oxide.  The particular focus will be on
               the interplay between the chemical nature of the hydrogen bond and  the
              hydrophobic interaction associated with the hydrocarbon  backbone.  These
              uncharged hydrosoluble polymers have important  applications to technological
              issues associated with the use of  inorganic solvents and also as models for
              the activity and function  of a class of biopolymers.  The work will be
              extended to copolymers  where one part has hydrogen bonding character and the
              other part is  a more typical hydrocarbon.  Such copolymers are potential 
              candidates for vesicle stabilizers in drug delivery systems.  %%%  This
              theoretical research will be carried out at both the  University of California
              at Santa Barbara and the University of  California at Los Angeles.  Analytical
              and simulational  investigations will be done on polymers which are soluble in
              water.  ***
