Abstract    :
              9407167  Eftink  In the last grant period we developed a multi-dimensional 
              spectrophotometer, which enables the simultaneous and automated  measurement of
              multiple types of optical data (circular  dichroism, fluorescence, absorbance
              and light scattering) as a  function of temperature, added denaturant, or
              hydrostatic  pressure.  It is proposed to further develop this method by 
              adding full spectral fluorescence detection (via an intensified  diode array)
              and by adding the capability of automatic pH (or  specific ion) measurement
              during titration experiments.   Additionally we will add a stopped flow
              accessory to this  instrument to enable multi-dimensional monitoring of the
              time  course of the folding/unfolding of macromolecules.  %%%  It is proposed
              to extend our studies of the thermodynamics of  protein folding by
              systematically perturbing proteins in ways  that are expected to lead to
              observable populations of folding  intermediates, with emphasis on the
              continued development of new,  multi-dimensional spectroscopic methods.  We
              will use these  multi-dimensional methods to study the unfolding of selected 
              proteins, which are selected because a) they represent examples  of different
              folding motifs (i.e., alpha helix bundle, beta sheet  structure, eight stranded
              alpha/beta barrel, mixed alpha/beta  structures having sub-domains, homodimeric
              proteins) and because  b) they show evidence for a multi-phasic transition
              under certain  conditions.  Our intent is to characterize the free energy of 
              coupling between domains/subunits and to appreciate the type of  perturbations
              that affect the interactions between  domains/subunits.  A second goal is to
              continue to develop our  multi-dimensional spectrophotometer and related
              methods, to  extend our ability to obtain equilibrium and kinetics data for 
              the folding/unfolding of proteins in a multi-dimensional manner.  ***
