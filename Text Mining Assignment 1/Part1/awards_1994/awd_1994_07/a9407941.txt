Abstract    :
              Bull   9407941   Virulent infectious diseases have been some of the most
              fear-provoking biological phenomena of human existence.  From the historical
              scourges of the plague, TB, malaria, and pneumonia to the recent emergencies of
              hemorrhagic fever, AIDS, and the drug resistant TB, mortality rates after
              infection have been known to exceed 50% for some of these diseases.  Yet not
              all infectious microbes are virulent enough to kill, and one challenge for
              biology is to unravel the causes of virulence.  Molecular biology is making
              important inroads on this problem for some diseases, but the population biology
              of virulence -- why the virulent forms of a microbe prevail over avirulent ones
              in the population -- lacks a solid empirical foundation. The work proposed here
              will develop this foundation using bacterial virus as a parasite of a bacterial
              host.  Experiments will be conducted to study how the population dynamics of a
              parasite infection influences whether a virulent or an avirulent form evolves. 
              Assays of the viral DNA sequence will indicate the genetic bases of these
              changes.  Overall, this study will serve as a model for uniting molecular and
              population biological approaches in studying disease virulence.
