Abstract    :
              9407100  Balazs  The focus of this theoretical research is to determine the
              effect  of polymer architecture on the properties of macromolecules in 
              solutions, in blends and at surfaces.  In these studies the focus  is on combs
              and branched polymers.  The aim of the research is to  determine how the
              entropic, as well as energetic, contributions to  the free energies of mixing
              are affected by the architectural  complexity of the macromolecules.  In
              particular, the formation of  micelles from comb copolymers in solution will be
              studied, as well  as the creation of miscible blends with combs and linear or
              other  comb copolymers.  An additional goal is to tether linear and comb 
              copolymers onto surfaces and create interfaces which mimic  biological systems.
               The objective is to design channels from  synthetic polymers that can display
              simple gating and switching  behavior or act as receptors for certain chains in
              solution.  %%%  This largely computational study will investigate the
              properties of  mixtures of polymers which are shaped like combs.  These type of
               polymers have unique properties, especially relating to adhesion,  enable a
              variety of structures to form.  Applications to biomimetic  systems which will
              simulate simple electronic behavior will be  studied.  ***
