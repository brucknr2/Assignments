Abstract    :
              9407755  Warde  1. Design, fabricate and characterize 2-D arrays of GaAs-based 
              optoelectronic circuits in which each pixel consists of an optical  detector,
              transistor logic and analog decision circuits, and a  light modulation or
              generation element.  Initially, ferroelectric  liquid crystals will be used for
              light modulation element and  ultimately, laser diodes will be used for light
              generation.   Nearest neighbor interpixel electrical communication and local 
              configuration memory will also be incorporated.    2. Build versatile hybrid
              optical processors by employing these  arrays of OEICs cascaded in conjunction
              with in-house fabricated  high efficiency computer-generated holograms, a 2-D
              detector array  and an electronic controller.    3. Characterize these optical
              processors and demonstrate their  operation in systems for solving difficult
              pattern recognition  tasks.  In specific, these OEIC processors will be
              programmed with  algorithms implementing unconstrained handwritten character
              and  word recognition functions we have developed.  ***
