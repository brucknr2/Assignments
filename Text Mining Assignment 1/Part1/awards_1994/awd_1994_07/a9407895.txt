Abstract    :
              9407895     Kiserow    This research combines experimental and theoretical
              methods to  investigate the electronic and molecular structure, the optical 
              properties, and photochemical degradation of elementary building  blocks based
              on linear chains of silicon atoms.  The primary issues  to be addressed are (1)
              the relation between chain conformation and  spectroscopic properties,
              particularly electronic and vibrational  spectra; (2) the nature of the
              low-lying electronic states and the  associated photophysical properties as a
              function of chain length  and conformation; (3) the relative stability of
              individual chain  conformers and the real-time dynamics of conformer
              interconversion;  and (4) the nature of the photochemical reactivity of the
              chains.   The information obtained for the simple models containing 3 - 30 
              silicon atoms will then be combined with the results of  measurements on
              high-molecular weight polymers and utilized to  provide a comprehensive picture
              of their optical and photochemical  properties.    This is a grant to Professor
              Josef Michl of the University of  Colorado at Boulder, jointly funded with the
              Army Research Office.  ***
