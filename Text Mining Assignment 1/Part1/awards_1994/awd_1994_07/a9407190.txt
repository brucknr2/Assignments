Abstract    :
              9407190  BROWN   This project provides funding for the study of five natural
              species groups of flies in the genus Apocephalus (Insecta: Diptera: Phoridae)
              that are parasites of ants.  There are 110 described species in this genus,
              mostly from coastal Brazil, but many more species await discovery and
              description from throughout the western hemisphere.  Massive collecting efforts
              utilizing Malaise traps will be conducted, supplemented by careful hand
              collecting to establish which ant species are the hosts of the parasites. 
              Phylogenetic relationships among these flies will be deduced from
              characteristics of the external body structure and the pattern of ant host
              selection will be explored in light of these relationships.    %%%   The study
              of this genus of parasitic flies will include description of many new species
              and keys for their identification.  It will provide information on a large
              group of little-known flies and contribute to our knowledge of insect
              biodiversity, especially for the South American tropics.  Studies of the
              biology of these flies and their interaction with ant hosts could yield
              information that might be used to control pest ant species, such as the
              imported or introduced fire ant in the southeastern United States.  ***
