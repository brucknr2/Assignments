Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is the investigation, design and  implementation of
              high performance VLSI architectures for two  dimensional pattern matching and
              recognition.  Although several  hardware algorithms have been proposed in the
              literature for the  one-dimensional pattern (string) matching problem and its 
              variations, very little work has been done in the area of hardware  algorithms
              for matching and recognition of two-dimensional   patterns.  Most of the
              research has been aimed at efficient  software algorithms based on different
              features and matching  strategies.  Many pattern matching applications need
              real-time  response, perform number of repetitive computations on different 
              data sets, make use of regular and local operations, are modular,  and have a
              fair amount of inherent parallelism.  The design of  special purpose hardware
              for pattern matching could speed up the  task considerably, making it amenable
              for real-time applications.    Specifically, the main objectives of this
              research are    . Develop new and efficient hardware algorithms and VLSI chips
              for  a class of pattern matching problems such as scene matching,  approximate
              string matching, polygon matching and tree matching.    . Design and develop an
              application specific system architecture  for pattern matching and recognition
              through integration of the  above mentioned VLSI components at board level.
