Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9407827  University of Delaware  P.I.:  N. Kobayashi      A
              combined modeling and experimental approach to assist in the understanding of
              beach erosion will be undertaken.  A hydrodynamic model will be developed to
              predict the spatial and temporal variations of breaking wave velocities, shear
              stress and turbulence intensity in the surf and swash zones.  Experiments will
              be conducted in a wave flume in which the fluid velocities in the thin bottom
              boundary layer on a rough bottom will be measured.  Turbulence measurements in
              the surf zone will be used to elucidate the processes of the turbulence
              generation, advection, diffusion and dissipation in the surf zone as well as to
              calibrate and evaluate the turbulence model adopted in the numerical studies. 
              Velocity and free surface measurements will be used to evaluate the
              capabilities and limitations of the developed numerical model for predicting
              the spatial and temporal variations of fluid velocities and shear stress under
              breaking regular and irregular waves.
