Abstract    :
              Shaw  9407937   Research supported by this grant will determine if mating
              between related individuals of the moss, Ceratodon purpureus, results in
              offspring that are less fit than mating between unrelated individuals.  In
              addition, actual patterns of interbreeding within two populations will be
              investigated in order to relate experimental results to plants in natural
              habitats.  The research involves growing plants of known familial pedigree,
              conducting crosses, and measuring both viability and fertility in offspring
              from different matings.   Because the study organism is haploid   (i.e., cells
              contain one set of chromosomes rather than two as in most plants and animals),
              new insights into the genetic consequences of consanguineous mating are
              expected.  Although this research addresses basic scientific questions,
              understanding the effects of different mating patterns is critical to a range
              of applied issues including the conservation of rare and endangered plants and
              animals, and the most effective breeding strategies for increased agricultural
              production.   Funding for this research also provides critical support for
              involvement of undergraduate students in biological research.  In addition to
              research opportunities during the academic year, funding supports full-time
              collaboration between undergraduate students and the Principle Investigator
              during two summers.  Active undergraduate involvement in research is the most
              effective way to promote the development of promising young scientists.
