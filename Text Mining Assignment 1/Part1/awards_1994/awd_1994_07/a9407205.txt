Abstract    :
              9407205  Siebenaller    The low temperatures and high hydrostatic pressures of
              the deep sea  influence the structure and function of proteins and membranes in
               marine animals.  These environmental factors represent an important  selective
              force shaping the molecular evolution of organisms  colonizing and inhabiting
              the deep sea.  This project addresses the  influence of these environmental
              parameters on the transduction of  extracellular signals into intracellular
              effects.  How extensive  are the effects of hydrostatic pressure on
              transmembrane signaling  in cold-adapted fishes?  At the molecular level, what
              are the loci  at which pressure acts?  How are species which live in deep water
               adapted to cope with the high pressure?  These studies will be  conducted in
              marine teleost species which are abundant at different  depths.  The effects of
              pressure will be examined for membrane  receptors which are coupled to adenylyl
              cyclase via guanine  nucleotide binding proteins (G proteins).  Both receptors
              which  negatively modulate adenylyl cyclase and those which stimulate  adenylyl
              cyclase will be examined.
