Abstract    :
              9407129  Nilsen    Regulation of Seasonal and Spatial Water Use by R. maximum at
              Two  Elevations at Coweeta (LTER)    The understory of the Appalachian forest
              is dominated by two  ericaceous shrubs Kalmia latifolia and Rhododendron
              maximum. In  particular, R. maximum covers over half a million hectares of 
              southern Appalachian forest. Dense thickets of this species,  called "slicks",
              inhibit the growth of canopy trees. These dense  growths are often close to
              streams making R. maximum a keystone  species in the interface between
              terrestrial and aquatic  ecosystems of the southern Appalachian mountains.
              Although R.  maximum must have a significant impact on several ecosystem 
              processes, the "role" of R. maximum in functions of the  Appalachian forest
              have been only rarely studied. The influence  of R. maximum on ecosystem
              hydrology may be one of the important  impacts of this species on the
              Appalachian forest system. The  objectives of this proposal are: 1. to
              determine the factors that  regulate water use patterns in R. maximum; 2. to
              develop  mathematical functions that predict water use patterns from 
              environmental conditions; 3. to collect evidence for possible  competition for
              water between R. maximum and an important canopy  species. Experiments are
              designed to fit into the currently  funded research program at the LTER site at
              Coweeta Hydrological  Laboratory. Results from this proposal will clarify the 
              importance of R. maximum in the ecosystem water budget for the  regulation
              mechanisms therefore for R. maximum water use, and  determine if competition
              for water between this important  understory species and a canopy dominant
              species is likely.    ***
