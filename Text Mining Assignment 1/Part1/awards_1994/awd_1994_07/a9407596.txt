Abstract    :
              9407596  Lovell     This project examines the community structure and
              environmental specificity of nitrogen-fixing bacteria that occur across the
              gradient from highly productive, low intertidal marsh to stressed,
              low-productivity, high marsh.  This gradient in productivity is reflected in
              gradients in salinity, H2S concentration, pH, and redox potential, all of which
              have likely impact on the nitrogen-fixing bacteria.  The bacteria in turn may
              generate a gradient in nitrogen availability, which may control plant
              productivity.  The project characterizes the bacterial communities along this
              gradient by PCR amplification of the bacterial DNA and DNA "fingerprinting." 
              The resulting banding patterns provide a means of identifying key bacterial
              species and determining the composition of bacterial communites along the marsh
              gradient.  The physiological responses of key bacterial species to
              environmental stresses are being studied.  The investigator is also conducting
              reciprocal transplants of bacterial communities to examine bacterial and plant
              responses to the new environmental conditions.    This research improves our
              ability to determine the effect of non-point source pollution on salt-marsh
              microbial communities and the effects of changes in these communities on higher
              organisms in salt marshes.  The results of this research has application in
              pollution monitoring and environmental risk assessment.
