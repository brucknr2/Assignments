Abstract    :
              9407777  DeFanti    The CAVE is a virtual reality System which allows users to
              surround themselves with artificially generated reality.  One of its unique
              features is the ability for a group of persons to immerse themselves at the
              same time.  This makes the CAVE a natural for demonstrations.    This project
              will choose, by peer review, around 40 science projects and will work with the
              chosen disciplinary scientists to translate their work into the CAVE
              environment.  A CAVE system will be set up at SIGGRAPH (the foremost exhibition
              in high-end visualization equipment, software, and underlying research) to show
              the results of the project.
