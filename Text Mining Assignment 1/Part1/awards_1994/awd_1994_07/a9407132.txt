Abstract    :
              9407132  Simon       The investigator and his colleague undertake an extensive 
              computational and analytical study of the energy surfaces given  by the energy
              functions on finite-dimensional conformation spaces  of knots.  The focus is on
              two conformation spaces: polygonal  knots, and harmonic knots, where harmonic
              knots are those given  by finite Fourier series parametrizations.  Recent
              theorems  relate the invariants given by these energy functions to  classical
              invariants such as crossing number.  So this project  should lead to a better
              understanding of knots realizable with  relatively low degrees of freedom.     
               Knot theory is the mathematical study of the everyday  objects called knots. 
              Once thought the purview of theoretical  mathematicians, knot theory has
              recently found a wide range of  applications, in fields as diverse as molecular
              biology and  cosmology.  For example, DNA molecules are usually knotted, and 
              in the replication process must somehow become untangled.  In  this project the
              investigators apply sophisticated computing  techniques to the study of knots. 
              In particular, they continue  the development of a new approach to knots:
              physical knot theory.   The mathematical knot is given physical properties, and
              knot  types are distinguished by computations involving these  properties.  For
              example, knot conformations can be assigned an  energy, and then knot types can
              be distinguished by considering  minimum energy conformations.  The conceptual
              basis of the  approach is familiar to researchers in biology, chemistry, and 
              physics as well as mathematics.  The project produces both  theoretical results
              and software.
