Abstract    :
              9407082  Kinsey  The long term goals of this project are to determine the
              mechanisms and control of transposition of the LINE-like element, Tad from
              Neurospora crassa.  Tad is a 7 kilobase retrotransposon.  It is present in
              active form in the Adiopodume strain of Neurospora crassa, but only inactive,
              multiply mutated form in other strains of Neurospora.  The active Tad elements
              lacks terminal repeats, but contain two long non-overlapping ORFs on the DNA
              strand with the same polarity as the full length message.  ORF1 shows homology
              with a small part of the gag genes of other LINE-like elements.  ORF2 contains
              blocks of homology that are considered diagnostic for reverse transcriptase,
              including one block that is characteristic of the reverse transcriptase domains
              of other LINE-like elements.  Tad is capable of transposing between nuclei in a
              heterokaryon, and an intron inserted into ORF has been used to demonstrate that
              TAD is a bona fide retrotransposon.  In this project the focus is on the
              control of transcription and transposition.  A combination of approaches are
              being taken to include:  1) in vitro mutagenesis of the 5' promoter region. 2)
              analysis of proteins that bind to the 5' end of TAD and the sequences to which
              they bind.  3) cloning and disruption of genes coding for proteins that bind to
              sites that are required for transcription and transposition.  4) analysis of
              sites near the 5' end where cytosine methylation is associated with
              transcriptional inactivity of Tad.  5) Isolation and characterization of
              chromosomal mutants that effect TAD expression and transposition.  6) analysis
              of mutations of minus strand ORFs and promoters.  In addition experiments will
              be carried out to begin to analyze the relationship TAD and the RIP process. 
              %%%  Neurospora has one of the few genetic systems where this type of jumping
              gene can be studied.  A similar jumping gene is present in tens of thousands of
              copies in human chromosomes.  ***
