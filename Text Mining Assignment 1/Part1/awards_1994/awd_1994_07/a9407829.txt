Abstract    :
              Peterson  Improved understanding of the nitrogen cycle in estuaries is needed to
              help explain how anthropogenic changes in nitrogen inputs are affecting coastal
              systems.  We propose to experimentally test conceptual and numerical models of
              nitrogen dynamics in an estuary by adding 15N-enriched dissolved inorganic
              nitrogen to the upper reaches of the Parker River-Plum Island Estuary, the site
              of and ongoing NSF-funded Land Margin Ecosystem Research (LMER) program. 
              Previous whole system labeling experiments in forested watersheds, lakes and
              rivers have demonstrated there feasibility, power and cost effectiveness of the
              tracer addition approach.  In the Parker River-Plum Island Sound estuary,
              intensive measurements of the distribution of the added nitrogen tracer will
              yield estimates of fluxes and residence times of nitrogen in water, food web
              components and sediments.  The 15N addition experiment will provide information
              to test and refine complex models estuarine N flow that are otherwise very
              difficult to validate.  The product will be greatly improved understanding of
              the transport, transformation, and fate of nitrogen in riverine saltmarsh
              estuaries.
