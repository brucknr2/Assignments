Abstract    :
              Cockburn         The investigator studies, both theoretically and 
              computationally, massively parallel, efficient methods for  numerically solving
              problems in which convection plays a major  role.  Of particular interest are
              the drift-diffusion and  hydrodynamic models for semiconductor devices, and the
               compressible Navier-Stokes equations (with high Reynolds numbers)  for viscous
              flow.  The investigator obtains new a posteriori error  estimates for nonlinear
              scalar conservation laws, independent of  the numerical scheme under
              consideration, upon which adaptivity  strategies could be devised.  He also
              studies a priori error  estimates that allow a deeper understanding of the
              numerical  methods under consideration.       The objective of this research
              project is to develop, both  theoretically and computationally, ways to enhance
              the speed and  the accuracy of massively parallel methods for simulating
              several  problems in which convection plays a central role.  Applications to 
              the high-performance computing of simulations of semiconductors  and high-speed
              fluid flow are direct applications of the results  of this project.  A deep
              mathematical understanding of the  algorithms for this type of problem is
              essential for efficiently  obtaining accurate results, but is unfortunately
              lacking.  The  investigator studies theories that provide such an understanding
               to obtain the desired practical high-performance computing  algorithms.
