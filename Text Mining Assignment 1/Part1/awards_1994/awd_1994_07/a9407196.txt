Abstract    :
              9407196  Luke       The Department of Mathematics and the Center for  Applied
              Mathematics and Statistics at the New Jersey  Institute of Technology will
              purchase a workstation which  includes a memory upgrade, mass storage devices,
              and video  recording hardware and software which will be dedicated to  the
              support of research in the mathematical sciences.  The  equipment will be used
              for several projects, including in  particular:  1.)  Visualization of Unsteady
              Nonplanar Flame  Propagation  by Michael R. Booty;  2.)  Pulse Propagation in 
              Nonlinear Optical Fibers using Optical Amplification  by  Cheryl V. Hile;  3.) 
              A Mathematical Model of Walking with  Applications to the Physically  Disabled 
              by H. Michael Lacker;  and  4.)  Nonlinear Wave  Propagation in Disordered
              Media by Andre Nachbin
