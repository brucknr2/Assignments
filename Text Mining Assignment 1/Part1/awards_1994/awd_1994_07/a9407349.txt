                        Offspring represent parental investment in the future.  In 
              evolutionary terms, this means that parents should generally  behave in ways
              that maximize the number of offspring they  raise.  Certain aspects of this
              fundamental biological  question can be particularly well-studied in birds
              because  birds control the development of their young by when and how  they
              incubate eggs.  Dr. Beissinger will test several  hypotheses about the adaptive
               nature of parental behavior through a series of field  experiments which will
              examine different adaptive functions  of incubation behavior.  The results will
              be integrated into  a hierarchical model of reproduction and will help to 
              develop our understanding of the biology of reproduction.  In addition, because
              many close relatives of the species Dr.  Beissinger works with are endangered,
              this research will  have implications for conservation biology.
