Abstract    :
              9407284  Reed  U of Southern California  Dr. Christopher Reed, Chemistry
              Department, University of Southern California, is supported by the Inorganic,
              Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program for the study of weakly
              coordinating anions. In this study, Reed will prepare a variety of new anions
              which contain no good coordination sites and in which the charge is delocalized
              over a large volume. These will be used as counter ions both to obtain
              low-coordinate cations and to stabilize complexes of very weak donors such as
              xenon, hydrocarbons, etc. Using the of non-coordinating anions the magnetic
              properties of admixed-intermediate spin state Fe(III) complexes  will be
              investigated order to establish the relative ligand field strengths of these
              anions.  In general, negatively charged chemical species (anions) tightly
              associate with species bearing a positive charge (cations). This project will
              focus on the preparation of anions whose shape and charge distribution prevents
              them from closely approaching a cation. This will result in highly reactive
              cations, whose properties will be evaluated. While there are implications to
              several areas of chemistry, one of the most important is in the design of new
              catalysts for several industrially important processes.
