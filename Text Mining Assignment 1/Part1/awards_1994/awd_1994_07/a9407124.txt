Abstract    :
                     9407124  Bates     This project supports three cultural anthropologists
              studying how  Puerto Rican sufferers from chronic, incurable arthritis cope 
              with their pain and disability.  The researchers will identify a  group of
              about 65 sufferers from arthritis and in a series of  intensive interviews will
              study how they cope with and manage  their diseases.  This information will be
              compared with the  studies of how Anglo populations cope with chronic disease. 
              Methods include intensive life history interviews, examination of  patient
              records, and the administration of standardized  questionnaires dealing with
              pain management, coping strategies,  and psychological adjustment to chronic
              illness (the Arthritis  Impact Measurement Scale, McGill Pain Questionnaire,
              Satisfaction  With Life Scale, Ethnicity and Pain Questionnaire, and Locus of 
              Control style.       This project is important because it broadens the model of
               adaptation to chronic illness to include ethnic variables.  It  will add to
              our understanding of the human ability to adapt to  incurable chronic disease
              by determining what coping strategies,  resources, constraints and other
              factors in the subjects varied  environments affect their overall level of
              adjustment.  The  knowledge from this project will be useful to all health care
               personnel seeking to develop culturally relevant health care  delivery
              procedures.  The project also involves the research of  handicapped and
              minority scientists, and therefore contributes to  the diversity of the active
              researcher population.
