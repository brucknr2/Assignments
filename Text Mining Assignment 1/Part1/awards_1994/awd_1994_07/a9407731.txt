Abstract    :
              Hershey  Fine particulate organic matter (FPOM) dominates macroconsumer food
              webs in most stream ecosystems.  However, dissolved organic matter (DOM),
              thought to be available only to microconsumers, is often the largest pool of
              organic matter present.  Dense aggregations of black flies, which often  occur
              at lake outlets an on bedrock cascades, appear to filter a very large portion
              of the FPOM entering the aggregation, but mass of this pool does not decrease
              as it passes across the aggregations; it increases.  Preliminary data suggest
              that the FPOM entering these aggregations is augmented by DOM, via black fly
              feeding and egestion.  The objectives of the proposed work are:  1) to
              determine the importance of DOM and FPOM feeding to FPOM and DOM pools in
              streams; and 2) to evaluate the role in black fly feeding.  To meet these
              objectives, a series of upstream and downstream comparisons, stable isotope and
              dye tracer experiments, filter-feeder removal experiments, and laboratory
              feeding experiments will be used to measure:  1) FPOM passing through a
              filter-feeder aggregation, including mass, size distribution of particles, and
              chlorophyll concentration; 2) transformation of DOM to FPOM; and 3)
              availability of different size fractions (molecular weights) of the DOM pool to
              black flies.  The same processes that occur in these dense aggregations could
              also occur in more diverse stream communities; however, effects would be harder
              to detect.  Thus, although these experiments focus on special cases, they may
              have broad applicability to stream organic matter dynamics.
