Abstract    :
                     9407084  Rankin-Hill     This project (which is collaborative with
              9407124, Bates)  supports three cultural anthropologists studying how Puerto
              Rican  sufferers from chronic, incurable arthritis cope with their pain  and
              disability.  The researchers will identify a group of about  65 sufferers from
              arthritis and in a series of intensive  interviews will study how they cope
              with and manage their  diseases.  This information will be compared with the
              studies of  how Anglo populations cope with chronic disease.  Methods include 
              intensive life history interviews, examination of patient  records, and the
              administration of standardized questionnaires  dealing with pain management,
              coping strategies, and  psychological adjustment to chronic illness (the
              Arthritis Impact  Measurement Scale, McGill Pain Questionnaire, Satisfaction
              With  Life Scale, Ethnicity and Pain Questionnaire, and Locus of  Control
              style.       This project is important because it broadens the model of 
              adaptation to chronic illness to include ethnic variables.  It  will add to our
              understanding of the human ability to adapt to  incurable chronic disease by
              determining what coping strategies,  resources, constraints and other factors
              in the subjects varied  environments affect their overall level of adjustment. 
              The  knowledge from this project will be useful to all health care  personnel
              seeking to develop culturally relevant health care  delivery procedures.  The
              project also involves the research of  handicapped and minority scientists, and
              therefore contributes to  the diversity of the active researcher population.
