Abstract    :
              9407856  Wissinger     There is accumulating evidence that ecologists'
              perceptions of the structure of aquatic food webs has been overly simplistic. 
              Recently there has been much interest, but relatively little data on intraguild
              predation (IGP; i.e., predation of species with similar feeding habits on one
              another).  The objectives of this research project are to determine the effects
              of intraguild predation and cannabalism among caddisfly larvae on adult
              fitness, study the proximate mechanisms that mediate IGP among caddisflies, and
              quantify the direct and indirect effects of other invertebrate predators and
              salamander on the outcome of these caddisfly interactions.    This research
              will provide the first data on intraguild predation in aquatic detritis-feeding
              organisms.  The results will improve our understanding of the functioning of
              aquatic ecosystems and have application in aquatic pollution abatement and
              management of aquatic ecosystems.
