Abstract    :
              9407061  Whitfield  This is a Research Planning Grant (RPG) to enable the PI to 
              develop a Research at an Undergraduate Institution (RUI)  proposal. The scope
              of the RUI proposal would include the  development of a methodology and tools
              for combining various  compiler optimizations into a single environment. Such
              an  environment would permit the evaluation of the cost and benefits  of
              optimizations. It would also facilitate the investigation of  the interactions
              among optimizations and if certain combinations  of optimizations produce
              better results than the individual  optimizations or not. Preliminary
              investigations will be  performed during the planning grant.  ***
