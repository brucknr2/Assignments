Abstract    :
              9407348  Callard    In all egg laying vertebrates and many viviparous non- 
              mammals, development of eggs depends upon yolk, made in the  liver under
              estrogenic control and deposited in the ovary.  In contrast, in some placental
              non-mammals (viviparous or  live bearing species) and all eutherian mammals,
              yolk  protein is either variably or totally suppressed.  Dr.  Callard has shown
              that suppression of yolk protein synthesis  associated with viviparity is due
              to progesterone, the major  ovarian steroid of gestation.  In this proposal, he
              will  investigate the cellular and molecular basis of the  progesterone
              counter-regulatory function using a fish model.  ***
