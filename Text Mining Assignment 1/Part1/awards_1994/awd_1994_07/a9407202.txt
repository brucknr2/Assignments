Abstract    :
              9407202  Losos     This project consists of a long-term experiment on Bahaman
              islets to test for competitive interactions between two similar species of
              Anolis lizards.  The investigators are introducing each species of lizard
              alone, or in combination, onto replicate islets naturally lacking these
              lizards.  The investigators are also collecting data that will reveal whether
              morphological character displacement has occurred during the course of the
              experiment.  The project also measures the direct and indirect effects of the
              lizards, singly and in combination, on lower trophic levels.    Character
              displacement has been a very important concept in population biology and
              ecology, yet has never been demonstrated experimentally.  This experiment is
              important because it will measure for the first time the ecological processes
              that operate during character displacement.  The results of this study can be
              applied to conservation biology, especially in the design and management of
              natural reserves and the management of endangered species.
