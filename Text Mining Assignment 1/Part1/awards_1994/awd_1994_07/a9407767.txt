Abstract    :
                    These studies are to investigate how hormones from the brain of a 
              primitive  fish, the sea lamprey, control reproductive  function.  This 
              hormone is a protein called gonadotropin-releasing  hormone  (GnRH). 
              Gonadotropin-releasing hormone is present in all  brains  of  all  vertebrates.
               This  hormone  regulates  reproduction  by  stimulating the release of
              hormones from the pituitary which,  in  turn,  stimulate  activity of the
              gonads. Since  1971,  when  the  structure  of  mammalian GnRH was determined,
              over  5000  analogs  have  been  made  to GnRH and tested in hundreds  of 
              studies  in  mammals.  Analogs are variants of the GnRH protein molecule  with 
              different substitutions of amino acids that can either  make  the  GnRH  a 
              more potent hormone or an antagonist to the hormone.  In  mammals there has
              been great success using various mammalian GnRH  analogs for sterilization,
              conception and other therapeutic uses.  The  scientists  who  are doing this
              study  have  identified  the  primary  structure of GnRH in the sea lamprey and
               have  provided  evidence  for  its  regulatory influence on the
              pituitary-gonadal  axis.  The  goal  of  the present studies are  to  determine
               the  biological  effects of lamprey GnRH. The long-term  goal  of  the 
              studies  is  to  develop lamprey GnRH analogs as  an  alternative  method for
              sterilizing lampreys in a sterile-male release program  in  the  Great  Lakes 
              region. This is  an  exciting  possibility  because   these  compounds  are 
              proteins  which  are   easy   to  synthesize,  easy  to  administer,  easily 
              degraded  within  the  organism, and non-toxic to humans.
