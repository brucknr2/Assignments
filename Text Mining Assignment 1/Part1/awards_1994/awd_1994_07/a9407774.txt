Abstract    :
                9407774  Chave      Investigators from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution,
              AT&T Bell  Laboratories, and University of Alaska will collaborate on a novel 
              ocean science instrumentation development project that will adapt  very
              low-light astronomical imaging technology for ocean research  applications. 
              The investigators will construct a set of low light  charge coupled device
              (CCD) cameras that are designed to operate in  three modes: 1) an ambient light
              imaging tool; 2) as a  simultaneous, multispectral scanner and 3) as a low
              resolution  spectrometer.  The device will be deployed by the deep submersible 
              ALVIN at hydrothermal vents and at mid-ocean ridges.  This work  addresses a
              recent scientific discovery of abiotic light in the  deep ocean.  The source of
              this light is unknown, but the existence  of photoreceptors on shrimp
              inhabiting these very deep regions has  produced speculation that a non-solar
              light source may influence  the local habitat.  The proposed ALISS (Ambient
              Light Imaging and  Spectral System) is designed to measure the available light
              and its  spectral properties.
