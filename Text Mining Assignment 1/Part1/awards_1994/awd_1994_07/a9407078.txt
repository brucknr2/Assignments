Abstract    :
              9407078  Smith  We propose to develop a capability for placing lithographic
              features at assigned position to better than 1nm, using both
              scanning-electron-beam lithography (SEBL) and focused-ion-beam lithography
              (FIBL). This will be achieved by means of spatial-phase-locking, a technique
              recently invented at MIT.  Based on our recent research, in which sub-1 nm
              repeatability of spatial-phase-locking was demonstrated, we firmly believe we
              can develop a convenient, generally applicable, and readily transferrable
              technology for sub-1 nm feature placement precision within the 3 years
              proposed.  We also believe that the proposed research will lead to a
              significant reduction in the cost of e-beam and ion-beam lithography systems
              because the positioning precision will rely upon continuous feedback and
              computer control rather than expensive, secondary-referencing electromechanical
              systems.  Such a cost reduction could, in turn, make nanotechnology more widely
              available to the research community, and thereby expand the impact of this
              technology.  ***
