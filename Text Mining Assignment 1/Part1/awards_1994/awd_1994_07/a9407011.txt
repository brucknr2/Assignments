Abstract    :
              Partial support is provided to the Tulane University to  acquire a 300-MHz,
              wide-bore, solid-state Nuclear Magnetic  Resonance (NMR) spectrometer for
              on-going research of 10  faculty members and 42 postdoctoral fellows and 
              graduate/undergraduate students in the Departments of  Chemistry and Chemical
              Engineering. The existing NMR  instruments at this University have no
              solid-state  capability. Solid-state spectroscopy has become an essential  tool
              for the structural characterization and dynamic study  of solid-state materials
              important to chemistry, chemical  engineering, and materials science.
              Accordingly, the  purchase of this instrument will enhance the analytical 
              instrumentation capability of two Departments and will bring  significant new
              capability for the characterization of bulk  crystalline and glassy materials.
              The major users will  employ solid-state NMR for the investigation of polymeric
               (biological, organic and inorganic), ceramic, and zeolitic  materials. The
              instrument will also be used in the support  of existing research involving
              industrial-university  collaborations.
