Abstract    :
              9407074  Srivastava         The objectives of this work are the structure and
              evolution of  the (size) spectra of both raindrops and cloud drops.  
              Characteristics of the former, including rain rate and water  content, will be
              explored using observations from two radars,  transmitting at different
              frequencies, and evaluating the  attenuation to "improve" the backscattered
              reflectivity.  Characteristics of cloud drop spectra, on the other hand, will
              be  investigated using recent numerical results to improve existing  theory and
              the use of VHF radar to measure droplet spectra at  selected sites.  Both
              topics will help to understand the physics of  (liquid) precipitation.
