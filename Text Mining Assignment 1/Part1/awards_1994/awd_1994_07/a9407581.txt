Abstract    :
              9407581  Clark    Lowland tropical rain forests contain a substantial part of
              the planet's above-ground carbon and are the richest terrestrial habitats in
              plant and animal species.  In spite of their global importance and rapid rates
              of  tropical deforestation, surprisingly little is known about the basic
              ecology of the largest organisms in these forests, the canopy trees.  This
              project will extend the longest running investigation on annually-measured
              growth, mortality, and tree microenvironment for tropical rain forest trees. 
              The study is located in one of the world's most active centers for tropical
              rain forest research, the La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica.    Results
              from the first 11 years of study have led to new insights into the ecology of
              tropical rain forest trees.  Multiple regeneration patterns are apparent.  The
              great dynamism of these forests causes high rates of physical damage to young
              trees.  The vast majority of young trees occupy very dark microenvironments, 
              frequently passing years with no growth.  Small increases in light, as cause by
              the fall of a nearby canopy tree, have important effects on saplings'
              performance and survival.  Substantial differences in annual growth occur
              concurrently across species, indicating the pervasive impact of short-term
              climatic variation on the productivity of the forest as a whole.  Data from
              this project are providing a unique understanding of the ecology of  canopy
              trees in tropical rain forest.
