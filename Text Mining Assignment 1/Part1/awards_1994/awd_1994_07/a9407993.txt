                      Dramatic advances have been made in the way in which  biologists make
              and test predictions about the evolutionary  relationships among animals.  
              However, the process of  applying these modern phylogenetic methods to the
              behavior  of animals has just begun.  This approach has great  potential for
              increasing our understanding of evolution and  behavior.  In order to pursue
              this important area of  research, it is necessary to work with groups of
              animals  whose ecology, morphology, developmental biology, and  phylogenetic
              relationship are all known.  Dr. Hastings has  identified such a group of
              animals whose natural behavior is  easily studied in the laboratory. He will
              conduct detailed  studies of their behavior and combine the results with 
              existing information to work out a detailed picture of  behavioral evolution in
              this group.  This project will help  develop a deeper understanding of the role
              of behavior in  evolution.
