Abstract    :
              9407055  Theoretical research will be conducted on the dynamical and  electronic
              properties of surfaces in materials.  The work involves  non-adiabatic charge
              transfer, vibrational line shapes, atom-  surface scattering, sticking and
              desorption, and adiabatic  potentials and rates.  The principle goal of the
              research is to  discover the fundamental principles which determine the motion
              of  electrons, atoms, and molecules at the surfaces of metals and  insulators,
              as well as to develop theories of what the various  experimental probes of
              these motions actually measure.    %%%  A theoretical research program will be
              continued to study the  properties of surfaces and their response to various
              external  probes.  The research is of fundamental importance in understanding 
              the structure and properties of surfaces, and of strategic  importance in
              utilizing many of the technologies which are so  dependent on material surfaces
              such as catalysis and  microelectronics.
