Abstract    :
              9407607  Abstract  The project will be a study of a key protein required for a
              site-  specific recombination reaction in yeast, Flp.  The mechanism of  the
              reaction has been studied and a number of mutants isolated that  block the
              reaction at different stages.  The work will involve  characterization of the
              mutants to identify protein domains  involved in specific sub-reactions.  Of
              special interest is the  substrate recognition domain which determines which
              DNA sequences  will be recombined.  Site-specific recombination systems are 
              extremely useful tools for genetic engineering of complex genomes  including
              potential uses with plants and humans.  ***  In some organisms, two different
              DNA molecules can be joined to one  another at very well defined sites, that is
              specific base  sequences, which exist in the two molecules.  This is an
              important  reaction for cells in many different ways.  Expression of some 
              genes is regulated by this mechanism, viruses are able to maintain  long-term
              infections of host cells via the process, and generation  of antibody molecules
              and related proteins depend heavily on site-  specific recombination.  The Flp
              system from yeast is a model  system for studying this process using both
              biochemical and genetic  approaches.  In this project, mutants in the Flp
              recombinase will  be characterized to understand how the sequences of DNA are 
              selected for recombination and also how different domains of the  protein
              affect different aspects of the process.  %%%
