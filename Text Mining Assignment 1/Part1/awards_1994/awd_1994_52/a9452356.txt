Abstract    :
              9452356  Angevine  Somerset Community College of the University of Kentucky is 
              developing a mobile computer laboratory that can be transported  from classroom
              to classroom. This equipment and the mobility of  such computers are providing
              students in various courses such as  calculus, pre-calculus, college algebra,
              geometry, and mathematics  for elementary teachers the hands on experience of
              using computers  in the area of mathematics. Students have an opportunity to 
              experience the vastness of mathematical knowledge and have an  in-depth look at
              mathematics at its best. Students see the changes  of graphs at their
              fingertips, are able to explore problems more  easily without the complications
              of numerical manipulation, and  experience the use of the computer in
              mathematics teaching which is  important for students going into the education
              field.
