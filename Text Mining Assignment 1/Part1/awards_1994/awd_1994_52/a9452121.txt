Abstract    :
              9452121  Cook  This proposal will enhance four (4) courses in the 
              Electrical/Electronic Engineering Technology program at Ferris  State
              University. The courses (EEET 311, EEET 412, EEET 422, EEET  428) form the core
              analog and digital courses along with the  capstone project course in the EEET
              program. It is proposed to  enhance these courses by updating the electronic
              design automation  tools to allow circuits to be designed, simulated and
              fabricated  which contain mixed types of devices. These types would include 
              analog, microprocessor and programmable logic devices.  The  specified hardware
              and software will allow a circuit to be designed  and simulated to observe
              operation. The printed circuit board or  multi chip module will then be layed
              out. Thermal profiles of the  resulting board will be observed and the final
              artwork for the  board will be generated along with appropriate documentation
              for  the design. The board will then be assembled and final testing will  be
              performed.  The proposal requires purchase of ten (1O)  workstation computers
              and associated peripherals. Mentor Graphics  design automation software is
              specified because of its complete  suite of tools which can accomplish the
              proposed tasks.
