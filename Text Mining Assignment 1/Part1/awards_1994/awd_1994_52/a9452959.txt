Abstract    :
              9452959  McCartney    ABSTRACT     The University Museum at the University of
              Arkansas is  conducting preliminary planning for expansion of their 1994 pilot
              project entitled "Women in Science."  During this planning phase, the staff
              will meet regularly with experts and teachers to design an exhibit about
              non-academic female scientists in Arkansas that will travel throughout
              Arkansas, outline a workshop for teachers that would help them encourage their
              female students to participate in math and science, and develop a program that
              enables female scientists to work with groups of students.  At the end of the
              three and a half month planning stage, a final report will present a plan for
              the exhibition, gender workshop, and scientist program which identifies
              personnel, gives models/prototypes, and a budget for each facet of the proposed
              project.
