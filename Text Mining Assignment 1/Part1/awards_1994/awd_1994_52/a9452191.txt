Abstract    :
              9452191  Dorwin                               The project is to develop and
              improve two courses in underwater  archaeology. One course focuses on classroom
              work involving  background, and theory and technologies of underwater
              archaeology.  The second course emphasizes field work and conservation
              laboratory  techniques and experience. Also, the field work takes place in two 
              locations, Lake Michigan and the White River at Conner Prairie near 
              Noblesville, Indiana. Currently, students work on shipwrecks in  Lake Michigan
              and excavate trade goods lost in the White River at  the landing associated
              with the Conner Trading Post (1802-1823).
