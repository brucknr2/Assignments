Abstract    :
              9452197  Dewey  The Civil and Environmental Engineering Department, as part of
              the  effort to insure that graduates are environmentally literate as  well as
              technically competent, is restructuring the Civil  Engineering Materials course
              sequence. Unifying themes of the  revised three course sequence include an
              awareness of the  environmental impact of material acquisition and use along
              with the  development and use of material evaluation protocols as decision 
              making tools. The course sequence includes an introductory class in  civil
              engineering material properties, a class in civil engineering  composites, and
              a class in properties of soils.  Laboratory  experiences are considered
              important to the understanding and  appreciation of material behavior, and
              these revised materials  classes will provide extensive hands-on opportunities
              to understand  experimental procedures and determine material properties. The 
              laboratory experience will start with manual equipment operation  and data
              collection and progress to computer controlled experiments  coupled with
              automated data collection and display. Materials  considered and characterized
              include traditional construction  materials as well as industrial and
              post-consumer residuals. An  awareness of non-conventional or novel materials
              will permit  graduate engineers to effectively utilize these materials as an 
              important part of pollution prevention efforts.  One of the manual  universal
              test frames and a data acquisition system procured under  this project will be
              mounted on a portable cart to permit classroom  demonstrations in later design
              classes.
