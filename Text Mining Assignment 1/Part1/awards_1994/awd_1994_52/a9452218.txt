Abstract    :
              9452218  Metaxas                                                          We are
              purchasing a multi-processor computer to support  undergraduate education in
              parallel computation in computer science  and other computation-intensive
              disciplines.  There is a strong  need to introduce parallelism to our
              curriculum.  Building upon our  substantial teaching and research in parallel
              computing and our  prior development of instructional resources to support
              educational  efforts in this area, we are developing a course and the necessary
               curricular materials (exercises, algorithm animations, textbook)  that will
              serve as a prototype for undergraduate teaching and  research in parallel
              computation in similar institutions.  Our  project is unique in its integration
              of algorithmic visualization  and multimedia technology, and in its firm
              grounding in  applications in biology, chemistry and computer science.  
              Furthermore, we have both the human resources and an extensive  infrastructure
              to support it.
