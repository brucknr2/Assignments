Abstract    :
              9452120  Laursen                                                   This project
              introduces programmable logic controllers (PLC) into  the electrical power
              curriculum and provides PLC training for  electronic technicians and
              maintenance electricians in local  industry. The project targets present
              engineering technology  students in the associate degree program and workers
              returning for  continuing education, specifically on the PLC. The laboratory 
              environment includes new PLC hardware, PC's, programming software  and
              simulation software.
