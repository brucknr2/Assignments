Abstract    :
              9452915  Hall    ABSTRACT    Children's Television Workshop will plan how
              science and mathematics can be incorporated into the plot line of the series,
              GHOSTWRITER.  The major work to be undertaken during this planning phase will
              be to assemble a group of science and mathematics educators to work with a
              subgroup of the existing series advisory board and with series content and
              research staff to:    o examine the interrelationships among disciplines such
              as science, mathematics, and English and language arts within the context of
              GHOSTWRITER,    o explore the integration of science and mathematics into
              GHOSTWRITER and devise educational goals that reflect the outcome of this
              exploration, and    o generate content topics and presentation techniques that
              will address these mathematics and science goals in GHOSTWRITER.
