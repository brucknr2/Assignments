Abstract    :
              9452782  Zollman    A series of units is created for use in high school physics
              courses that provide a way  to learn quantum mechanics without detailed
              knowledge of higher level mathematics.    The topic is introduced by
              discussions about and experiments related to quantum  devices, such as scanning
              tunneling microscopes and tunnel diodes, that are rapidly  finding their way
              into modern technology.  The approach will include hands-on  activities related
              to the devices as part of exploration activities in the materials. The  units
              will combine written materials, interactive computer programs,  computer 
              simulations, and digital multimedia.
