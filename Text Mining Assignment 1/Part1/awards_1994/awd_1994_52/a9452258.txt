Abstract    :
              A series of mini-courses under the general title of "Chemistry in  Modern
              Society: Fundamental Concepts & Practical Applications" is  being developed.
              The courses are being conducted entirely in  "laboratory settings".  About ten
              two-hour laboratory activities  are being designed for each one-credit course. 
              Course scheduling  varies as needed: it may be concentrated in a two to three
              week  period, or be spread over a whole quarter.  Up to five mini-courses  are
              being completed and test-run in an 18-month period.  These  include:
              fundamental concepts, nuclear, environmental, art, and  pharmacological
              applications of chemistry.  A comprehensive student  manual is being written
              for each mini-course.  This project takes  a significant step in turning away
              from the traditional lecture-lab  format of instruction to a student-centered,
              collaborative,  laboratory learning process in which the instructor is a guide
              and  a resource person, and the students actively engage in hands-on  exercises
              that are designed to trigger an appreciation and a  practical understanding of
              fundamental concepts of chemistry.  We  wish to attract, retain and educate
              those students who have  difficulty with introductory chemistry in conventional
              practice for  various reasons, by starting them with one mini-course at a time.
                This innovation is being conducted in a community college with  extensive
              vocational programs and a high percentage of  nontraditional students.  As such
              it supports a national model for  promoting and implementing science education
              reform in settings not  adequately addressed currently.
