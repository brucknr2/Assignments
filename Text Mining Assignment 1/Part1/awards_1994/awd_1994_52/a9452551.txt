Abstract    :
              9452551  Hale                                 Molecular biology instrumentation
              added to the freshman biology  laboratory enables professors to sponsor
              meaningful research at the  freshman level.  Fourteen weeks of this
              two-semester course now  includes elements of molecular techniques.  Seven
              weeks are devoted  to basic techniques.  Four weeks are devoted to creating a 
              restriction map of a plasmid. Three weeks are spent using a thermal  cycler to
              map the dispersal of "genetically modified organisms."
