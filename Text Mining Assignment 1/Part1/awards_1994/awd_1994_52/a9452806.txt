Abstract    :
              9452806  Unruh    The University of North Iowa seeks to initiate a three-week,
              summer  commuter, Young Scholars Program (YSP), in the fields of physics  and
              chemistry for 24 students entering grades 8 and 9.  The project  will provide
              students with enriching summer activities along with  a series of Saturday
              morning follow-up activities during the  academic year.  The project focuses on
              several basic physics,  chemistry, and mathematics concepts, including energy
              transfer,  light, sound, density, graphing, probability, and statistics.  
              Students will have opportunities to engage in career exploration  activities
              through interactions with scientists from a variety of  work settings who may
              serve as role models in their fields.
