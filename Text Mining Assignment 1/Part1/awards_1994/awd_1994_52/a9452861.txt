Abstract    :
              Improving the infrastructure for conducting statistical studies of education,
              especially mathematics an science education, is imperative if policy decisions
              are to be informed by a reliable and extensive knowledge base.  based on
              experience from its current grant (Enhancement of Education statistics,
              Mathematics and Science Education, and the Educational Research Infrastructure,
              RED-9255347). AERA proposes a program of research and training designed to
              achieve two primary objectives: (a) to enhance the capability of the research
              community to conduct research using nationally representative data sets that
              informs education policy and practice, and  (b) to increase scholars'
              understanding of national policy and practice issues through communication with
              federal government social scientist and administrators.
