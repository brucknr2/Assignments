Abstract    :
              9452453  Whisnant                             The goal of this project is to
              strengthen the physical chemistry  courses of three colleges by giving students
              the opportunity to  work with laser equipment. The three colleges have formed a
               consortium to purchase the laser system, which each individual  institution
              could not make available otherwise. This laser system  will make it possible to
              demonstrate contemporary activity in  physical chemistry, with the result being
              improvement in our  students' laboratory skills and attitudes toward physical 
              chemistry. The system will be compact, durable, and portable,  allowing us to
              move it around, so that each college will have  immediate access to the
              equipment every third semester. We also  will bring students to another college
              to use the system when it is  not located at our individual institutions. The
              laser system will  be versatile -- we have four experiments planned for the
              project  and others are possible. This project will have a significant  effect
              on the chemistry programs of the three colleges, since all  of the chemistry
              majors from the consortium members will use the  laser system. The project also
              will be significant because our  consortium, which will pool resources to
              obtain expensive  laboratory equipment, could serve as a model for other
              institutions  in a time of tight budgets and rising equipment costs.
