Abstract    :
              9452771  Goldman    This project, Middle- school Mathematics through
              Applications  Project 11 (MMAP 11), builds on and is a continuation of the 
              original MMAP. This project will result in a comprehensive,  three-year
              mathematics program for grades 6-8. The goals of MMAP  11 include: (1) The
              development of materials to create a complete  mathematics program that could
              serve all 6th through 8th graders  regardless of prior skills or ability
              levels. (2) The provision  of resources, materials, and guidance to mathematics
              educators to  help them assemble MMAP materials into a coherent, customized, 
              and affordable curriculum to meet local needs.  (3) The creation  and
              compilation of guidelines and activities to help teachers  identify and
              systematically evaluate mathematical competencies  and mathematics embedded in
              students' work. and (4) The  galvanization of a community of mathematics
              educators,  researchers, and mathematics-using professionals to collaborate  in
              identifying the needs and means necessary for developing  additional MMAP
              materials.  These goals will be achieved by using  an interactive, cyclical
              research and development process created  and piloted in the previous project. 
              This project creates  innovative software and investigations to simulate real
              world  problems that rely on mathematical concepts and skills to solve.    ***
