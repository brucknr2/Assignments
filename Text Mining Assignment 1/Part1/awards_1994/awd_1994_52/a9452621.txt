Abstract    :
              9452621  Mignone  A Macintosh based computer classroom/lab is being developed
              for use  in the three course calculus sequence followed by a linear algebra 
              course. The interactive learning capabilities, along with the  symbolic,
              numeric and graphical capabilities of Mathematica is  being used in the
              computer classroom/lab in conjunction with  structured tutoring provided by the
              mathematics tutoring lab. The  focus group is a group of African American
              students guided toward  the two sections of calculus which will be
              participating in the  first stages of the project.
