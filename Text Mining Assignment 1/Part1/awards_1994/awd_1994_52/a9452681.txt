Abstract    :
              9452681  Seelke    The University of Wisconsin-Superior will initiate a
              five-week,  residential, Young Scholars Project in aquatic and fisheries 
              biology for sixteen American Indian Students entering grades 11 or  12. 
              Through a combination of field, laboratory and classroom  activities, three
              students will receive a positive and supportive  introduction to science.  They
              will learn to monitor the health of  aquatic communities, and then use this
              background to evaluate a  lake or stream as a fish habitat.  Their learning
              will culminate in  group projects in which they conduct environmental or
              fisheries  assessments of a lake or stream, presenting their results to their 
              peers.    The training that students receive will enable them to develop 
              independent study projects which will be completed at their local   schools
              during the following academic year.
