Abstract    :
              9452265  Dwyer                                The Chemistry and Physics
              Departments are purchasing a high field  FT-NMR and Mossbauer spectrometers to
              develop a modern magnetic  resonance laboratory for use in undergraduate
              laboratory  instruction and research.  The laboratory already equipped with an 
              EPR spectrometer is being used in integrated chemistry and physics 
              undergraduate laboratory courses to allow students to employ  multiple modern
              magnetic resonance techniques used in industry,  medicine and university
              research to investigate complex systems.   The magnetic resonance facility also
              is enhancing  undergraduate  research projects in chemistry and physics.
