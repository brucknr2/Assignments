Abstract    :
              9452705  Gaines    The University of Miami seeks to initiate a five-week,
              commuter EAI  Young Scholars Project in ecology for 36 students entering grade
              7.  To engender enthusiasm for science and an understanding of  ecological
              principles in the context of Florida's environment,  students will be engaged
              in activities in ecology, statistics,  computer literacy, writing, and
              philosophy of science and ethics.  The  program will blend interactive
              discussions, field exercises,  communication exercises and research
              experiences. Students will be  provided opportunities to engage in
              research-oriented activities  led by an active researcher at the University of
              Miami.
