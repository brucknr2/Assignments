Abstract    :
              9452316  Miller                                                    A powder
              X-ray diffractometer will be used in teaching and research  in the departments
              of Chemistry, Environmental Studies  (Environmental Geology and others), and
              Physics. Powder X-ray  diffractometry is one of the most widely used methods
              for crystal  structure analysis and mineral/rock/material identification. UNCA 
              long ago had a diffractometer, which became obsolete when it could  not meet
              tightening safety standards and the repair costs exceeded  its value, so
              currently we have no facilities here or in the  community with which to teach
              students X-ray methods or to analyze  mineral/rock/material samples. The
              acquisition of an X-ray  diffractometer will allow the faculty authors,  all of
              whom who  have had prior experience with X-ray diffraction, to include 
              experiments and techniques based on X-ray methods and theory in  solid state
              chemistry, geology, physics, and soils classes. Topics  that would be covered
              in classes and used in student and/or faculty  research include crystal
              structure analysis and X-ray techniques in  combination with Mossbauer, NMR,
              and other analytical methods;  mineral/material identification and
              determination of relative  amounts in rocks, heavy mineral sediments, and
              materials (such as  synthesized inoraganic compounds and municipal incineration
              ash);  chemical analysis of specific mineral species by peak shifts in 
              diffraction patterns; and characterization of clay minerals, soils,  and soil
              components.
