Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is acquiring a 200 MHz FT-NMR to  provide
              undergraduates across the chemistry curriculum with hands-  on experience with
              an instrument that plays a pivotal role in  modern experimental science.  Among
              the experiments being  undertaken in organic, analytical, physical and
              biological  chemistry laboratories are T1, T2, T1p, measurements, experiments 
              using INEPT, DEPT, APT techniques and 2-dimensional NMR.  The  instrument is
              also being used in the active undergraduate research  program.
