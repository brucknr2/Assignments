Abstract    :
              9452538  Grismore                                                  The Digital
              Systems laboratory in Electrical Engineering has been  enhanced through the
              acquisition of digital oscilloscopes and pulse  generators to permit the
              incorporation of dynamic and timing based  experimental investigations into the
              curriculum. Industry standard  instruments provide students the experience of
              interfacing with  state of the art equipment, and add the capability to observe
              and  measure timing and dynamic effects. The importance of these effects  in
              digital systems design is emphasized. The experimental  activities are
              integrated into the theoretical and lecture content  of a new required
              four-quarter curricular sequence in Digital  Circuits and Systems.
