Abstract    :
              9452907  Heard    ABSTRACT     The Foundation for Advancements in Science and
              Education (FASE) is requesting a planning grant to explore the feasibility and
              potential of establishing a specialized educational news service aimed at both
              commercial and noncommercial news programs.  During this planning phase they
              will:    {SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h} convene an Advisory Board to review
              and refine the project.  This committee will examine such issues as what types
              of information should be included in such a news service, how stories will be
              selected and by whom, how accuracy and balance of each story will be
              determined, and how to assess the effectiveness of the effort in terms of
              impact on viewers interests, knowledge, and action;    {SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol"
              \s 10 \h} conduct market research to ascertain the receptiveness of the
              television news markets to an information product of this type,    {SYMBOL 183
              \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h} analyze the methods by which stories could be effectively
              and economically distributed, and    {SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h} assuming
              that feasibility of such a project is established, develop a specific plan for
              proceeding in a larger and longer-term scope.
