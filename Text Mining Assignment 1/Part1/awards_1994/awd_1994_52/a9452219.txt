Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to enhance the laboratory  experience in
              introductory astronomy for non-science majors by  providing a set of new
              activities in each of the two courses  offered based on currently available
              computer simulations.  This  project will improve the quality of undergraduate
              education in  science by replacing relatively passive learning techniques with 
              more active ones.  Students will be involved in a laboratory  environment which
              is more dynamic, less intimidating, and which  allows the individual
              exploration which can capture the imagination  and lead to the excitement of
              scientific discovery.  They will take  from these courses a greater
              understanding of science and a greater  appreciation of its importance in their
              lives.
