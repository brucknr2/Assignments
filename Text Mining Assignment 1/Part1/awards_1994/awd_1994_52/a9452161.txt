Abstract    :
              A new course in Environmental Water Quality has been developed in  the
              Agricultural Engineering Department at the University of Idaho.  The course is
              part of the Agricultural Engineering and the new  Biological Systems
              Engineering curricula. The laboratory component  of the course covers non-point
              sources of water contamination, such  as leaching from agricultural land,
              erosion from forestry land and  effluent from livestock and fish production
              systems. The course  integrates physical experiments and demonstrations on
              chemical  transport processes with computer simulation of non-point source 
              contamination processes. Students from a number of academic  departments with
              an interest in water and environmental resources  can enroll in this course.
