Abstract    :
              9452422  Cheung  A national model for multivariable calculus laboratory
              instruction  which integrates the use of computer - in particular, the 
              mathematical software MAPLE V - into the teaching and learning of  the material
              is being designed. With the help of the computer,  students are improving their
              comprehension of the material and  moving more quickly into the application of
              ideas to problem  solving. They are developing 1) a public domain library that 
              contains custom Maple programs designed for the teaching and  learning of
              multivariable calculus, 2) two versions of a laboratory  manual for use with
              the Maple library and laboratory instruction.  The first version of the project
              covers the conventional  multivariable calculus topics in most standard
              calculus textbooks.  The second version integrates Maple with the
              non-conventional  multivariable calculus syllabus developed by the Harvard
              Calculus  Consortium.
