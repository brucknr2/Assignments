Abstract    :
              9452280  Jardim                               The biology curriculum at a
              community college is significantly  strengthened through attention to
              biotechnology.  Students  investigate biological phenomena at the molecular
              level via  performing a series of "hands-on" innovative laboratory 
              experiments, including the following: cloning with pAMP and pKAN  fragments;
              amplifying of DNA by PCR; and electrophoresis and  spectrophotometric analysis
              of DNA. More than 600 majors and  non-majors enrolling in four different
              courses-General Biology,  Introduction to the Science of Living Organisms,
              Genetics  Laboratory, and Introduction to Human Physiology--are enriched by 
              this project each year.
