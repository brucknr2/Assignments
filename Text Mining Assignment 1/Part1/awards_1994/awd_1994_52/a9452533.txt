Abstract    :
              9452533  Beals  Funding for a scanning electron microscope (SEM) with energy 
              dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) has been received. The facility  is being
              used to develop the curriculum in biology, chemistry,  physics, art courses and
              for senior research and honors projects.  The SEM-EDS provides the nucleus for
              paired-course curriculum  development in the natural and physical sciences,
              reducing the  artificial disciplinary barriers between subject matter and 
              ways-of-doing science. It is also being used in correlative TEM/SEM  studies in
              the Electron Microscopy course offered by the Project  Director.  Mary Baldwin
              College serves several student populations:  traditional-age undergraduate
              women; young women in the PEG program  who begin their college work one to four
              years early; students in  the Adult Degree Program, a non-residential B.A.
              program for women  and men; and students in Young Women in Science, a summer
              program  for outstanding high school science students.  The presence of the 
              SEM at Mary Baldwin College aids in recruiting talented female  students into
              the sciences. It enhances the technical and research  skills of female science
              majors, increasing their qualifications  for employment or graduate research,
              and facilitates their research  in biology, chemistry, physics and art.
