                TITLE:   Teacher and School Administrator Participation in the AAAS Forum 94:
               Implementing Science Education Reform in the Classroom    Project Description:
                This project will provide support for 100 school personnel including K-12
              teachers, administrators, and school board members, to participate in the 1994
              AAAS Forum for School Science.  The 1994 Forum will focus on national, state,
              and local efforts to implement standards-driven reform.  Discussions and a
              poster session will highlight states' and local districts' attempts to
              implement such change among schools, teachers, and students.   It brings
              together science educators, scientists, business people, state and federal
              policy makers, Congressional staff, and others for invited p presentations and
              informal discussions on current major issues in science education.  The 1994
              Forum will be held on October 7,8 of 1994 at the Doubletree Hotel/National
              Airport in Crtstal City, VA.   A companion report will be issued with the
              appropriate conference documentation in it.
