Abstract    :
              9452383  Mickley                              Research in the field of
              Neuroscience is progressing rapidly and  student demand is high for curriculum
              in this area. To support this  need, we provide a laboratory for undergraduates
              (psychology majors  and non-majors at all levels) with some demonstrations and
              a  variety of hands-on experiences in behavioral neuroscience. The  project
              focuses on laboratory experiences in a physiological  psychology course.
              However, demonstrations of basic neuroscience  techniques and knowledge gained
              from these techniques are  integrated into other courses in the psychology
              curriculum. The  project utilizes equipment to enhance skills with computers as
               research tools, the learning of brain anatomy, the brain's 
              structural-functional relationships and the practical methods of 
              neurophysiology and behavior. These enhancements also support our  emphasis on
              the learning of general scientific principles.
