Abstract    :
              Ten appropriately-configured workstations that will support  Wavefunction's
              SPARTAN software are being added to the laboratory  equipment available.   The
              workstations, combined with Spartan's  flexibility, intuitive dialogues,
              state-of-the-art high-performance  computing and state-of-the-art graphics are
              allowing the Department  to bring computational chemistry to at least eight
              courses in its  curriculum (more than two-hundred students per semester are
              being  served by this new program). Spartan is a unique pedagogical tool.   It
              can be used at several levels of sophistication to easily and  effectively
              teach students at all levels (from freshman to senior  and major to non-major)
              about molecular structure, electronic  structure, thermodynamics, and
              reactivity.  For many years now,  computational chemistry has played a very
              significant role in both  industrial and academic, graduate-level research, and
              now is the  time to introduce computational chemistry into the undergraduate 
              curriculum.
