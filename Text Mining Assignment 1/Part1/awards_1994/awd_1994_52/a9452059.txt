Abstract    :
              9452059  Penumadu                                                  An automated
              electro-pneumatic controlled true triaxial testing  device with flexible
              boundaries enables students to investigate the  importance of stress path and
              drainage conditions on the strength  of soils. Two types of laboratory
              experiments that use this device  have been developed. The first familiarizes
              students with concepts  related to static transducer calibration, analog to
              digital  conversion, signal conditioning, software and hardware gain and 
              problems of aliasing. The second type deals with the isotropic and  anisotropic
              consolidation and testing of soil samples using a  predefined stress path.
              Stress and strain controlled static shear  tests can be performed and
              essentially any stress path can be  simulated through the data acquisition and
              control software. This  laboratory capability shows the relevance of the
              various laboratory  strength tests with actual field conditions using the same
              testing  device, and illustrates the concepts related to electronic data 
              acquisition and control. An important benefit is that the same  device can be
              used to illustrate the drained and undrained  stress-strain characteristics of
              both isotropic and Ko consolidated  soil samples. The samples can be sheared
              under a predefined stress  path and the observed pore pressure behavior (for
              undrained  testing) can be compared. Soil testing programs are developed to 
              examine the issues related to type of consolidation, stress path  and the rate
              of loading.
