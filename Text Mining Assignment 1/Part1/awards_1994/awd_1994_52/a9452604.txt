Abstract    :
              9452604  Cotts                                                     A
              differential scanning calorimeter system will be used in  undergraduate
              laboratories primarily at the sophomore, junior and  senior level and in summer
              independent research projects in the  Physics Department at SUNY-Binghamton. 
              The instrument will be  utilized in a series of laboratory experiments designed
              to  illuminate the subject of Thermal Physics for physics and pre-  engineering
              majors.  The differential scanning calorimeter will  allow the introduction of
              a wide variety of experiments, at a  number of different levels. The
              experiments will range from those  with a high level of direction and firmly
              established procedure, to  those which attempt to generate original
              contributions in current  research topics in Physics. The experiments include
              measurements of  phase transitions in materials (including melting, lambda 
              transitions, and impurity freezing point depression), the heat  capacity of
              solids, and solid state reaction kinetics and  energetics. Additional
              experiments involve the study, in the  context of Thermal Physics, of the
              operation of the calorimeter.
