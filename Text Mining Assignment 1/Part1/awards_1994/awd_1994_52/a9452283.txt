Abstract    :
              9452283  Jiracek                                                       
              Geophysical equipment is being used for field programs at two  universities and
              a multi-institutional field camp.  The equipment  includes a dc resistivity
              unit, a transient electromagnetic (TEM)  system, a ground penetrating radar
              (GPR) unit, and a portable  magnetometer/gradiometer, all being used in courses
              in Applied  Hydrogeophysics at San Diego State University (SDSU) and Field 
              Geophysics at the University of California at San Diego (UCSD).   The use of
              this equipment in these courses reflects the changing  role of geophysics,
              which emphasizes environmental/hydrologic  applications where electromagnetic
              methods are preeminent.   Students are becoming familiar with the newest
              techniques used in  environmental geophysics.  In addition, the use of the
              equipment in  the Summer of Applied Geophysical Experience Program (SAGE) is 
              allowing undergraduate students from small schools with limited  geophysics
              offerings to learn hands-on use of modem equipment in a  true research
              environment.
