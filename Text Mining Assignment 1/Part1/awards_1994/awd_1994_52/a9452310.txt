Abstract    :
              The Weather Graphics and Simulation Laboratory (WGSL) at San  Francisco State
              University (SFSU) is being expanded.  Operated by  the Meteorology Program of
              SFSU's Department of Geosciences, the  WGSL currently provides real-time
              weather data, graphics, and  simulation software in support of the Meteorology
              program  curriculum.  The WGSL is used by the faculty in their preparation  of
              lectures and laboratory exercises to help students visualize the  evolution of
              weather features and to enhance their understanding of  the basic physical
              principles that control the behavior of these  events.  We identified the
              following major needs in the Meteorology  curriculum: (a) to help students
              simultaneously visualize the  evolution of atmospheric phenomena and analyze
              their physical  causes and (b) to foster an environment in which students will 
              engage in "what if" discussions that involve the manipulation of  real weather
              data to construct different scenarios that involve the  manipulation of real
              weather data to construct different scenarios  and predict their outcome.  We
              have observed that students learn  difficult concepts best when they can work
              in small groups,  together visualizing atmospheric data, articulating problems
              and  working out solutions.  New computer equipment and software are  being
              used to augment the SGSL facilities to provide students with  a collaborative
              learning environment in the affected classes where  they have simultaneous
              access to weather data and a variety of  analysis software.
