Abstract    :
              9452514  Blaha  We propose to bring Carleton's observational astronomy program 
              into the 21st century through the introduction of  state-of-the-art technology
              in our laboratories and lectures.  This ILI project will equip a new
              astronomical image processing  lab which will enable our students to gather
              their own images  here on campus, to use modern astronomical software packages
              to  analyze their data and to interpret their results in a  collaborative
              research setting. Through experimenting with two  small format CCD cameras, we
              have found the ST-6 camera to be  the best choice in terms of high quality
              images and ease of  operation. We are requesting five new ST-6 CCD cameras to
              equip  the six 8-inch Meade reflectors used in observational labs,  with camera
              control and data acquisition to be provided by six  Macintosh Duo systems.
              These Macintosh computers will also be  used in the lab to run the Voyager II
              planetarium display  packages, telescope observing simulators as well as
              numerous  image analysis programs. A fully equipped software laboratory  will
              allow both introductory and advanced students to explore  the universe and to
              understand the celestial motions they  observe. Two Sun workstations will
              provide more powerful image  processing tools, access to data on the Internet
              and rapid  image data storage and retrieval when connected with the  network of
              Macintoshes. To provide more advanced research  opportunities, we are also
              requesting a Photometrics Star-1 CCD  and a spectrograph to be used with our
              permanently mounted  refractors. With these tools, students and faculty will
              create  new lab experiments to engage future generations of observers  and
              challenge them to learn the power of modern astronomical  observing techniques.
