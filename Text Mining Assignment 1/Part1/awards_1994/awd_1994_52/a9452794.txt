Abstract    :
                    ESI-9452794    Phil J. Gersmehl    A CD-ROM and associated software and
              data bases are being  developed for use in teaching geography of the United
              States  in secondary schools.  This project is based on a previously  funded
              NSF project, Activities and Readings in the Geography  of the United States
              (ARGUS), which is presented in a print  format.  The CD-ROM will have four key
              components:  photographic images that will bring selected aspects of the  world
              into the classroom for description and analysis; maps  and graphs that will
              summarize the geographic patterns of  phenomena and illustrate theories that
              geographers have  developed to explain those patterns; short animations that 
              will lead viewers around the images, maps, and graphs and  make transitions
              between them, for example by highlighting  an earthquake fault in a photograph
              or showing how data in a  table apply to a specific location on a map;
              simulations and  supporting data tables that will encourage and model active 
              exploration within the context of a problem situation.  The  materials are
              being developed in focused modules that can  become the basis of a course on
              geography or be used as  units in a number of courses.
