Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    9452767  Sadler    This proposal is to research, develop, and test
              six modules based on engineering projects for middle school students.  These
              materials aim at inclusion in introductory physical science courses, but may
              also be used for general science and after-school or other informal teaching
              situations.  Topics include mechanics, electricity, and chemistry. A team of
              experienced middle school physical science and technology education teachers,
              research engineers, and scientists produce effective, up-to-date,
              activity-based, middle school physical science materials dealing with
              "designing to constraints."  The materials are evaluated to determine their
              effect on students' involvement and interest in pursuing technical careers as
              well as changes in their aonceptual understanding and science process skills. 
              A particular focus of the evaluation is the impact of the project strategies on
              urban underrepresented minorities and girls, many of whom have little
              experience with, or show fear of, mechanical devices.  Dissemination is through
              a series of summer institutes, workshops at teacher conferences, and journal
              articles.  A commercial publisher is to market the product.
