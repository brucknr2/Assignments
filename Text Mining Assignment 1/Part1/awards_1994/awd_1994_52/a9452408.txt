Abstract    :
              9452408  Abraham                                                   The
              acquisition of a precision grating spectrometer and a beam  profiler will
              significantly improve intermediate and advanced  optics laboratory instruction
              at Bryn Mawr College. These two  instruments with computer-controlled data
              acquisition and data  analysis will be used throughout both semester of the
              academic year  for projects in Zeeman spectroscopy, atomic spectroscopy,
              analysis  of optical patterns of lasers modes, phase conjugated signals and 
              fiber optics, and in studies of black body radiation and  diffraction patterns.
              The use of precision instruments in the  training of one of the largest groups
              of women physics majors in  the country, will enhance their understanding of
              phenomena in  physical optics, laser physics, nonlinear optics, and atomic 
              spectroscopy. It will also give them confidence and competence in  the use of
              advanced instrumentation which will encourage them to  pursue careers in
              experimental fields and to explore research and  advanced experimental work.
