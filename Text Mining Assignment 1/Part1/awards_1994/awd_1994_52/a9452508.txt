Abstract    :
              9452508  Curtis  A laboratory project is facilitating the use of the 
              Laserdisc/Computer-Interactive package Preparing For Calculus for  Precalculus
              and Calculus I students. The project involves  establishment of: (I) a
              laboratory program to improve the  precalculus skills of those students in
              Calculus I at risk of  failure due to poor backgrounds; (II) a
              laboratory-exclusive  Precalculus course centered around videodisc instruction
              and  group-problem solving; (III) a laboratory program for Precalculus, 
              College Algebra, and Trigonometry students utilizing the videodisc  medium. All
              parts of the plan have as their goal increased success  and retention rates in
              Calculus I.
