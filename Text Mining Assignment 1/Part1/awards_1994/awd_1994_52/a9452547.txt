Abstract    :
              9452547  Plumb  This Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement project will
              equip  a laboratory/classroom and an open laboratory to support curriculum 
              innovation in Physics courses that focus on Electricity and  Magnetism.  The
              curriculum development activities in Electricity  and Magnetism continue the
              successful movement toward active  student involvement and a heavily
              observation-based approach to the  teaching of Mechanics.  The curriculum
              development activities will  precede and parallel the offering of a revised
              Electricity and  Magnetism course in Fall 1994. We will network Macintosh
              Quadra 660  computers, equipped with Vernier Universal Lab Interface Boards, to
               an Apple Workgroup server.  Students will use current and voltage  probes,
              smart pulleys and other computerized data acquisition  devices to construct
              and/or verify theoretical models in  Electricity and Magnetism.
