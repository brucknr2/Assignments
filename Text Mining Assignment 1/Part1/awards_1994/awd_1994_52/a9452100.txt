Abstract    :
              9452100  Baird                                The rising demand for commercial
              wireless communication and remote  sensing products parallels the engineering
              advances which permit  design of low-cost (microstrip/MMIC), high-performance
              microwave  circuits. An innovative undergraduate microwave laboratory is 
              developed to help meet the need for students prepared in this area.  The goal
              is to develop fundamental understanding of microwave  phenomena and basic
              engineering practice by (1) using meaningful  projects to excite students with
              knowledge that they can design,  build, and test low-cost microwave circuits,
              and (2) providing a  learning environment which permits students to
              simultaneously  compare the results of theory, animated visual simulations, and
               measurements.
