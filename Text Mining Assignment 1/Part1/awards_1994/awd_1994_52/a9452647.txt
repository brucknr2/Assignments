Abstract    :
              9452647  Royster  A coalition will direct, facilitate, and organize a series  of
              activities designed to determine needs and strategies for  systemic educational
              reform in a geographically challenged,  and economically depressed region.  The
              activities, which  include collection of baseline data, expansion and 
              networking of local partnerships, and identification and  testing of specific
              reform strategies, will be accomplished  by organizing the activities into four
              Study Groups.  These  Study Groups will bring the concept of systemic reform to
               isolated school districts while gathering the necessary  information, identify
              resources existing and those needed,  and will provide recommendations to
              inform the development  of an overall plan for implementing systemic reform of 
              science and mathematics education throughout the rural  region.
