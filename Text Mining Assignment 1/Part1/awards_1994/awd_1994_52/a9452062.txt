Abstract    :
              9452062  McKinley                                                  This project
              implements a new laboratory curriculum in the   Cellular and Molecular Biology
              core course, required for all  biology and most allied health majors. This new
              integrated series  of laboratories adapts its format from the NSF-sponsored
              workshop  "Introduction of Molecular Biology into the Undergraduate 
              Curriculum".  The laboratory provides a series of concepts and  protocols which
              progress logically from the isolation of  chromosomal DNA from a microorganism
              through the construction of a  genomic library, cloning of recombinant
              organisms, restriction  mapping and probing of clones.  Students experience
              specific  techniques commonly used in a wide variety of research  applications,
              and gain insight into the design of experiments that  accomplish a particular
              objective.  An advanced undergraduate  molecular biology course extends these
              experiences to include the  use of eukaryotic organisms and advanced techniques
              like PCR and  DNA sequencing.
