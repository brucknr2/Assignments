Abstract    :
              9452248  Stolzberg                            The Department of Chemistry is
              developing multiple approaches to  strengthen the connection between the
              laboratory and lecture  portions of Introductory General Chemistry. A major
              focus of the  plan is the proposed series of four atomic absorption
              spectrometry  experiments. After each experiment is done, and students have 
              examined data from other groups and interpreted their results, they  propose
              that a full lecture period be allocated for students to  make presentations of
              their interpretation of the experimental  data. Faculty will summarize student
              findings and put them into a  practical perspective. The experiments are
              designed so that the  students will practice the component parts of scientific 
              investigation. They will use well-designed experiments to make  comparisons of
              averages or trends, test hypotheses using inductive  reasoning, and examine and
              interpret relatively large data sets  reduced to graphical form. In addition,
              they will do short, out-of  lab writing exercises which will be evaluated by
              their peers.   They intend to make students comfortable with the idea of, and 
              enchanted with the ability of, the component methodologies of good  laboratory
              science.
