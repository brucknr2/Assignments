Abstract    :
              9452517  Rice                                                      The Physics
              department at Miami University is committed to  providing scholarly experience
              for students in modern optics,  stressing theoretical, experimental, and
              applied aspects.  With the  equipment requested in this grant, we wish to
              extend our  capabilities to include nonlinear optical effects and high 
              resolution spectroscopy into our laboratories. In the Optics and  Laser Physics
              course experiments dealing with second-harmonic  generation, phase conjugation,
              image processing, and AM modulation  of laser beams are proposed. Also, we wish
              to obtain low cost laser  diodes to develop more atomic spectroscopy labs, with
              higher  resolution than presently available at our facility. With grating 
              feedback to obtain narrow linewidths, these diodes present a low-  cost method
              to investigate hyperfine structure for example.  The  laboratory experiments
              resulting from the equipment acquisition  proposed herein would provide
              undergraduates experience with laser  and spectroscopic applications, concepts,
              and techniques in the  forefront of research that are utilized in modern optics
               laboratories across the nation.
