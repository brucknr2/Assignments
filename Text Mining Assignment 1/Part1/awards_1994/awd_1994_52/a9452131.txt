Abstract    :
              9452131  Myers                                31The project will develop a novel
              approach to the upper-level  undergraduate inorganic chemistry laboratory which
              successfully  integrates both the techniques and methodologies of scientific 
              research into the course. Further, the diversity of inorganic  chemistry, from
              molecular substances to structurally extended  materials, will be presented
              within the context of a single,  coherent laboratory course. This approach is
              already under way, and  student experience to date has run the gamut from
              photochemical  preparation and characterization of an organometallic complex to
               the preparation and ion exchange of a zeolite. Four new initiatives  are
              incorporated into the proposal: 1) use of a diode array kinetic 
              spectrophotometer in the study of reaction kinetics and mechanisms,  2)
              electrochemical characterization and preparation techniques  (e.g. cyclic
              voltammetry and bulk electrolysis), 3) preparation and  manipulation of air
              sensitive complexes by Schlenk techniques, and  4) use and maintenance of inert
              atmosphere enclosures. In addition,  desktop computers will be employed for
              calculating X-ray powder  diffraction patterns and for free energy minimization
              calculations  to predict optimum reaction conditions.
