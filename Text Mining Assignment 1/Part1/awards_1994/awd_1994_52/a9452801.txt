Abstract    :
              GER-9452801  University of Nebraska  Fuller                                 This
              program offers a unique combination of seven major components:    1.   Physics
              knowledge.  Before the trainees can begin a serious       career as educational
              innovators, they will have solid content       mastery of a science area.  2.  
              The process of knowing - develop a sound understanding of the       research
              methods and results in cognitive science -       participate in the workshop
              developed by Robert Karplus and       others entitled Physics Teaching and the
              Development of       Reasoning.  3.   Educational research methods - become
              familiar with a variety       of educational research both quantitative and
              qualitative       methods.  4.   Hypermedia - learn how to develop
              instructional lessons using       hypermedia including including applications
              software,       interactive digital video and microcomputer-based laboratory   
                 interfaces.  5.   Varied teaching experiences - serve as an assistant in a  
                  physics course at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln,       participate in
              a workshop entitled Developing Student       Confidence in Physics - serve one
              semester as a teaching       intern in the Department of Physics of the United
              State Air       Force Academy.  6.   Global perspective - spend one semester as
              research assistant       in the physics education group in the Department of
              Physics of       the University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands.   7.  
              Dissemination and teacher training experience.  The trainees       will spend a
              semester as an intern in a mulitmedia        dissemination and teacher training
              company, The Learning Team       in Armonk, NY.
