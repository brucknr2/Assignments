Abstract    :
              9452613  Toll  This project is supports recent curricular reform in biology by 
              introducing undergraduate students to modern, experimental research 
              technologies and techniques in the study of animal systems.  In  improvements
              to laboratory instruction of physiology, students will  use Macintosh
              computers, fitted with hardware/software interfaces,  transducers, and signal
              conditioners, to function as virtual  oscilloscopes and chart recorders.
              Experiments based on these  technologies will encompass physiological study of
              the respiratory,  circulatory, muscular and nervous systems.  Students will use
               microsurgical transplantation and microinjection technologies in 
              developmental biology, directed toward the study of controls of 
              cytodifferentiation and organogenesis in both protostomes and  deuterostomes.
              With the benefit of these new technologies, students  will first master the new
              techniques and then will be encouraged to  design conduct, and analyze the
              results of their own experimental  procedures.  These modernized laboratory
              experiences will be  incorporated in the new biology curriculum for
              implementation in  the fall of 1994 as follows: one first-year course required
              of all  students, both majors and non-majors; the second semester of 
              introductory biology required of majors; two upper-level courses in  biology.
              The new curriculum has at its core, experimentation and  original, creative
              research, with all second-year biology majors  taking a laboratory-based
              research methods course in preparation  for advanced classes.
