Abstract    :
              9452430  Croft                                This project will enrich our
              junior year modern physics lab by  introducing state-of-the-art experimental
              and data analysis  techniques drawn directly from research. The proposers are
              two  nuclear experimentalists and a solid state x-ray spectroscopist who  are
              committed to the goal of infusing this undergraduate lab with  a taste of the
              excitement and the power of modern research methods,  while maintaining the
              role of the lab as a teaching lab. The  proposed experiments are drawn from the
              expertise of the principal  investigators. Specifically one of the enrichments
              involves  introducing truly modern particle/nuclear physics techniques into  an
              experiment on the muon lifetime and the directional dependence  of cosmic rays.
              The second involves a two part introduction to  modern x-ray spectroscopic
              methods. Students will first explore  nuclear and atomic energy level schemes
              by fluorescent radiation  with a sophisticated high resolution x-ray detection
              system. The  second part involves the introduction to x-ray absorption 
              spectroscopy (XAS) the data analysis and experimental methods. For  the actual
              XAS measurements students will make a data collection  trip to the Brookhaven
              National Synchrotron Light Source which  should have a particularly high
              motivational impact on them.
