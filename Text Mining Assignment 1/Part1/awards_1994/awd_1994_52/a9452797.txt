Abstract    :
              9452797  Lee              The Louisiana State University at Baton Rouge will
              initiate a four-  week, residential, Young Scholars Project in astronomy and
              space  science for 24 female students entering grade 10. The participants  will
              learn the methodology  of science research by immersion into  the research
              activity of senior faculty in the Department of  Physics and Astronomy and
              other faculty in the physical science  departments of the College of Basic
              Sciences. The students will be  involved in classroom lectures and discussions,
              hands-on laboratory  and research activities, field trips, and seminars that
              will expose  them to the nature and excitement of space research and its 
              application to additional disciplines such as computer and  information
              science, geophysics and the environmental sciences.
