Abstract    :
              9452672  Badar    Case Western Reserve University seeks to initiate a four week,
               commuter Young Scholars institute in science and engineering for  twenty four
              students entering eleventh and twelfth grades.  At  the heart of the institute
              is a program of individual students  research projects carried out in the
              laboratories and under the  mentorship of CWRU faculty researchers in various
              science and  engineering departments.   Several instructional days emphasizing 
              science content , guided laboratory work and research methodology  will precede
              the assignment to research projects.  Career  exploration activities include
              field trips to private research  labs, a hospital medical physics department,
              and a nuclear power  plant.; guest presentations by academic and industrial
              science  and engineering professionals will offer further opportunities  for
              students to hear career perspectives.  Several sessions are  scheduled for
              consideration of ethical issues confronting  scientists and engineers. 
              Follow-up activities and projects are  required.  ***
