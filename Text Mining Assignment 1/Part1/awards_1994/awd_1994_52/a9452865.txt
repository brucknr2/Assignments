Abstract    :
              9452865  Buller    This five-month project will formulate the basic plan and
              establish  strategies for implementing a National Center titled:  Electronic 
              Pathways Alliance:  A Native American Science, Mathematics, and  Technology
              Think Tank.  This planning grant will result in  implementing a larger
              five-year project designed to reach out to  American Indian urban and rural
              communities to provide technical,  educational, and personnel support for their
              development and/or  enhancement of technological applications and
              communications, and  associated mathematics and science knowledge and skills. 
              The  Electronic Pathways Alliance will assist American Indian schools  and
              communities to upgrade science, mathematics, and reform their  efforts in
              restructuring these content areas in American Indian  education and
              communities.  Initially, a minimum of four national  projects will be finalized
              and begun as a result of this planning  grant.  The five-year project will
              operationalize the initial four  projects of Electronic Pathways Alliance in
              efforts to reach 100  interested American Indian communities (20 per year) over
              the five  years.  This planning Pathways Alliance and its associated  projects.
               A brief paper describing Electronic Pathways Alliance  and associated projects
              will be generated and distributed  nationwide to American Indian communities,
              schools, and other  interested organizations.  ***
