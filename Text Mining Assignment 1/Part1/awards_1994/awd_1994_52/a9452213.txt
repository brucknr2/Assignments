Abstract    :
              9452213  Betounes                                                  This project
              is to create a computational laboratory/classroom  learning environment for
              three senior level mathematics courses:  Partial Differential Equations,
              Differential Equations, and  Advanced Engineering Mathematics. This laboratory
              is enabling the  students, through experimentation and investigation, to 
              enhance  their comprehension of the subject matter in these courses. A novel 
              feature of the project is the use of portable computers, as well as  fixed
              laboratory computers, to augment the students' learning  process.
