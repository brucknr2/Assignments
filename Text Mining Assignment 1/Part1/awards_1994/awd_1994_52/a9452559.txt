Abstract    :
              Montgomery County Community College has upgraded its Environmental  Technology
              curriculum and is producing a higher caliber technician  and is providing
              continuing education that is resulting in new  careers in the technologies for
              a growing unemployed work force.  Our program has been developed using DACUM
              from the merging of  ideas and experiences of engineers, educators, and
              technicians in  the field. The goal of the curriculum is to give the students a
               fundamental background in general environmental theory and  application of
              this theory in field and laboratory exercises and  analysis. The curriculum
              emphasizes good field and laboratory  techniques, computer-aided data analysis,
              and both written and oral  communication of results. Equipment has been
              purchased for the  field and laboratory courses which are designed to reinforce
              the  environmental principles presented in the lectures. This equipment 
              includes computers, software and peripherals for performing data  analysis and
              presentation.
