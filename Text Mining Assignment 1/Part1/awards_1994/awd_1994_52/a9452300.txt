Abstract    :
              9452300  McNulty  An undergraduate mathematics computation laboratory for
              students  majoring in the natural sciences, engineering, and the mathematical 
              sciences is being developed. The central thrust of this development  is to
              integrate the use of computer graphics, symbolic computation,  and numerical
              approximation techniques into the freshman and  sophomore level courses in
              calculus and differential equations  taken by almost all students majoring in
              these disciplines.
