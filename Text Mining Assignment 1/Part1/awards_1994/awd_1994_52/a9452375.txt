Abstract    :
              9452375  Rose  A modern, computer automated system for atomic absorption 
              spectrometry has been purchased. The project is to enhance the  education and
              research capabilities of undergraduate students who  are preparing to enter the
              fields of environmental geology and  geochemistry by giving sophisticated
              "hands-on" assignments in  water analyses. The project emphasizes an integrated
              approach that  includes project conception, planning of the sampling strategy, 
              carrying out the sampling, carrying out the water analyses, data  reduction and
              presentation, report writing, and ethical  considerations regarding the use and
              abuse of scientific data. The  proposed project represents an upgrading of a
              prototype project  completed successfully in Spring, 1993, which involved 
              determinations of Pb in campus drinking fountains. A small subset  of students
              in Environmental Geology assessed the Pb concentrations  of drinking water in
              light of the EPA action level of 2O ppb Pb.  The students used an old, manual,
              and relatively inaccurate  graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometer. The
              proposed new  automated instrument enables this and similar assignments to be 
              carried out with superior results by all of the Environmental  Geology
              students, resulting in a better educated and better  prepared graduating class
              of scientists headed for professional  careers in environmental geology and
              geochemistry.
