Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a 300 MHz broadband NMR  spectrometer
              with variable temperature capabilities for the use of  undergraduate
              instruction.  The instrument is an vital component in  the implementation of a
              innovative long range undergraduate  laboratory project extending over the two
              years of instruction in  organic and physical chemistry.  Known locally as a
              series  experiment the students synthesize a porphyrin in the organic 
              laboratory and study many of its chemical and physical properties.   They
              retain a sample of the prepared compound for use in further  courses.  For
              example, in physical chemistry they acquire 2-D  spectra and investigate the
              tautomeric forms of porphyrins.  These  experiments are followed by conversion
              to both a diamagnetic and  paramagnetic metalloporphyrin which is investigated
              using both NMR  and EPR techniques.
