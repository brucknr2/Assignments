Abstract    :
              9452031  Baker  This project is designed to introduce science and non-science 
              majors to environmental compliance methodology with experiments of  four
              different types: (1) Measurements of specific properties of  substances like
              pKas or kf values, in complex solutions like those  that might be found in
              waste streams or measurement of distribution  coefficients of hazardous waste
              solutes between aqueous solutions  and oil or dirt or microbial sludge. (2)
              Degradation of organics by  treatment with inorganic oxidizers like ammonium
              persulfate or  hydrogen peroxide/light or oxidizing enzymes or microbial
              cultures.  (3) Experiments in which students manufacture a product by a method 
              that generates hazardous waste streams document concentrate and  clean up those
              streams. (4) Waste minimization experiments in which  the products of one lab
              experiment become the starting materials  for another (not necessarily in the
              same lab course). All of these  experiments are being managed by a high-quality
              UV-VIS  spectrophotometer capable of multicomponent analysis. This proposal 
              seeks funds for a Hewlett-Packard HP 8452A UV-VIS, a Vectra 486.25  computer
              with an HP50Q Desk Jet printer and software capable of  general scanning,
              multicomponent analysis and kinetic studies. This  project is giving students
              insight into how chemists have to think  in environmental compliance work, and
              into the experimental  ramifications of hazardous waste legislation on chemical
               manufacturing processes.
