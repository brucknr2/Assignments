Abstract    :
              9452255  Webers                               A scanning electron microscope and
              an upgrade of the attached  energy dispersive system are being used to enhance
              the electron  microscopy capabilities, including back scattered electron
              imaging  and quantitative capabilities, of the science division.  The  scanning
              electron microscope is housed in a new laboratory complex  with other
              instruments including a transmission electron microscope  and an X-ray
              diffractometer.  Students in a large number of  biology, geology, and physics
              courses are using the new instrument,  and students involved with research
              through either short term  projects or more extensive honors research projects
              in a variety of  disciplines are making use of the capabilities of the new
              system.
