Abstract    :
              9452050  Howland  The proposed state-of-the-art computer laboratory will support
              an  innovative new laboratory computer science course for students  majoring in
              disciplines other than computer science, especially  education majors who
              intend to teach science at the secondary  level. This new course concept
              implements a contained laboratory  that uses a breadth first rather than depth
              first approach to cover  a broad range of computer science topics at the
              introductory level.   The computer is studied as a phenomena, not just a tool
              yielding a  non-classical but effective approach to instilling basic computer 
              concepts in non-science oriented students. Finally, the course uses  the Scheme
              programming notation as a lingua franca to describe  computer science topics,
              build working models of computer science  constructs and perform laboratory
              experiments without being a  course which focuses primarily on teaching
              programming.
