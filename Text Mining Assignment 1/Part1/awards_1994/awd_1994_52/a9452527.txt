Abstract    :
              9452527  Moore                                                     A 200 MHz FT
              NMR spectrometer/system is being used in our  undergraduate laboratories in
              basic organic chemistry, where we  teach large numbers of science and
              engineering students.  At the  same time, this instrument is being heavily
              utilized by students  (mostly majors) in more advanced laboratory courses in
              structure  elucidation, organic and inorganic synthesis, physical chemistry 
              and undergraduate research.  One instrument is meeting the  differing needs of
              students in these courses because modern FT NMR  spectrometers are so flexible.
               They can be programmed to permit  the fast turnover needed to obtain many
              "routine" spectra while  retaining all of the potential needed for the full
              range of  experiments needed in more advanced work.  In the basic 
              ("sophomore") organic laboratory, we are able to give students the  opportunity
              to apply NMR to their own laboratory work, which  increasingly involves an
              "investigative" approach.  The logistics  of handling large numbers of students
              on one instrument are not  trivial.  In the advanced courses, where we deal
              with smaller  numbers, students have adequate instrument time, including 
              "off-hours", not only to obtain high-resolution spectra, but also  to do many
              other sophisticated experiments, including double  resonance decoupling,
              l3C-off resonance, NOE, 2D-NMR, variable  temperature and relaxation phenomena,
              etc.  In addition, we provide  students with our own library of spectra,
              recorded on "their"  instrument, to be used in lectures and associated study.
              This  instrument is having a major impact on the education of many  students -
              several hundred per year - by giving them access to a  modern FT NMR system.
