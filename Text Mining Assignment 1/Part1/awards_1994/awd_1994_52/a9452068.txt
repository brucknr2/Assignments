Abstract    :
              9452068  Qazi  The Research Foundation of the State University of New York, for 
              and on behalf of the SUNY Institute of Technology at Utica/Rome,  requests
              $51,496 from the National Science Foundation to develop  a cost effective,
              real-time multimedia communication facility. We  propose to link the
              Institute's image processing and fiber optic  communication laboratories by an
              optical network to improve  undergraduate instruction. The SUNY Institute of
              Technology has  committed $25,748 in matching funds for this project.  The 
              proposed project is intended to serve the needs of undergraduates  enrolled in
              the five electrical engineering technology (ETC)  courses that will be enhanced
              through this project. Undergraduate  students majoring in electrical
              engineering technology, computer  technology, photonics, and telecommunications
              will also benefit  from the improved curricula. The enhanced laboratory
              environment  will permit students to acquire hands-on experience using a 
              real-time system for the transmission of voice, video, and data;  to study the
              design of this facility; and to evaluate its merits.  Students will also learn
              how to capture, store, playback, and  process multimedia data on a personal
              computer using a fiber  optic local area network. Students will gain knowledge
              in the  areas of fiber optics, image processing, data compression, and 
              networking, all of which have become vitally important to  business and
              industry today with the emergence and rapid growth  of multimedia technology.
              Real-time lab experiments with software  and hardware will be used to achieve a
              stimulating hands-on  education.  The duration of the project will be 30
              months.
