Abstract    :
              9452622  Treas                                This project supports an
              undergraduate computer laboratory that is  used in conjunction with
              specially-equipped classrooms. The  facility focuses on technology-enhanced
              undergraduate instruction  in required lower-division statistics courses.
              Computer  workstations with supporting servers, linkages, and printers are 
              used, and the project implements three principal curricular  components. These
              include computer-assisted instructional drills on  basic statistical concepts,
              spreadsheet calculation exercises, and  student statistical analyses of data
              archives. These curricular  developments are tested in several sections of the
              required  three-quarter statistics sequence. The project serves over 1200 
              undergraduates each quarter, provides a first-course in  quantitative
              reasoning, and includes a significant number of  students traditionally under
              representative in science.
