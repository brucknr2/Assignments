Abstract    :
              9452398  Brem  We propose establishment of an analytical geochemistry facility 
              in the Department of Geological Sciences to be used in required  and
              independent-study courses. Current analytical equipment  cannot be used because
              it requires time-intensive methodologies  unusable within the constraints of
              laboratory courses, includes  irreparable items, and cannot analyze samples for
              a broad range  of elements or in aqueous media. Our request consists of: (1) 
              equipment for rapid and contamination-free sample preparation and  (2) an ICP
              spectrometer capable of analyzing a broad range of  major and trace elements in
              different types of media. The  equipment is essential for use in the required
              Geochemistry (GEOL  4O6), the required Senior Thesis Research (GEOL 498) and
              the  elective Water Quality Investigations and Control (GEOL 437)  courses. The
              equipment will greatly improve the undergraduate  program and will allow us to
              meet the following goals: to  increase students' ability to quantify geologic
              problems rather  than relying solely on traditional qualitative and descriptive
               methodologies, to reinforce students' comprehension of basic  scientific
              concepts by problem solving, to increase students  comprehension of uncertainty
              and error present in all geochemical  data and, finally, to encourage student
              interest in graduate  education resulting from positive, research-based
              experiences at  the undergraduate level.
