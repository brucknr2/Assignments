Abstract    :
              9452714  Vance    Michigan State University will initiate a six-week,
              residential,  Young Scholars project in mathematics and physics for 60 students
               entering grades 8 and 9. This summer program will select as  participants
              African American, Hispanic American, and Native  American middle school
              students from Michigan. The program will use  an informal mode with special
              emphasis on mathematical problem  solving, experiments in physics, the use of
              hands-on materials, the  use of technology to help solve problems in
              mathematics and  science, and precise description of results both written and 
              orally. Parents participate in a five day long conference. Follow-  up
              activities include continued work on mathematics and physics  research
              projects.
