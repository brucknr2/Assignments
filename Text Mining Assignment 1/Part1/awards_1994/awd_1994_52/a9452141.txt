Abstract    :
              9452141  Sweeney                         The Mathematics Department at Russell
              Sage College is establishing  a computer equipped combination
              classroom/laboratory for improving  instruction and learning in the lower
              division major mathematics  sequence. The equipment is necessary for the
              complete revision of  the calculus, linear algebra, and differential equations
              curriculum  and makes the computer the tool of first choice in problem-solving 
              and mathematical investigations.  The revised curriculum requires  that problem
              solving, problem formulation, concepts and insight  replace the tedious and
              repetitive manipulations common in current  curriculum.   The equipment and
              revised curriculum aid this all-  woman institution to encourage more women to
              attempt the study of  calculus and better assist those who do.  The laboratory
              requires 16 Macintosh Centris 650's each equipped  with 12 megabytes of main
              memory, 120 byte hard-drive, color  monitor, and MATHEMATICA. The laboratory
              also contains 4 Apple  Laser Pro 630's and a Centris 660AV which networks the
              computers  together
