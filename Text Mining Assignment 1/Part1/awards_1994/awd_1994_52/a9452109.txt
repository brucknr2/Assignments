Abstract    :
              The Elementary Lab Integration (ELINT) Project is a concerted  attempt to infuse
              renewed vigor into the introductory calculus  based physics lecture/laboratory
              through laboratory driven  instruction, and the addition of a third semester to
              the  traditionally two semester sequence.  As much as possible, concepts  will
              be introduced via exploratory classroom experiments or small  group lab
              experiments. Lecture and laboratory will be integrated to  the extent that no
              predetermined distinction will be made between  lecture and lab time.  To
              engage student interest and activity,  modern instrumentation and corresponding
              topics in modern physics  will be introduced early in the course and will be
              continued  throughout.  Within the first five weeks of the course students 
              will be introduced to an optical spectrometer, a digital spectrum  analyzer,
              fixed frequency and tuneable dye lasers, and the  ubiquitous air track.  As the
              course proceeds, students will learn  to use oscilloscopes, computer
              interfaces, nuclear detectors, and  advanced electronics.  The ELINT Project is
              scheduled to run for  two years using a revised version of the "Structures and 
              Interactions" model developed for the Introductory University  Physics Project
              (IUPP).  Data acquired for assessment of the  project will be carefully
              reviewed at that time to determine the  extent to which ELINT will be modified
              and adopted for all  (calculus and non-calculus) elementary lab sections.
