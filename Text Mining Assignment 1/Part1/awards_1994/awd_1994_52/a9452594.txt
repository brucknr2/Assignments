Abstract    :
              9452594  Nosek                                Senior level multi-semester team
              software development projects of  "real-world" problems provide inestimable
              rich learning  experiences. However, the usual problems that student teams 
              encounter in finding opportunities to meet are exacerbated for poor  and middle
              class urban students who commute, work to pay for  educational expenses, and/or
              are physically challenged. Current  computer-based laboratories available for
              student software  development teams are inadequate in several major ways:
              limited  availability; restrictions on student access to client/server 
              functions to prevent inadvertent student-caused failure of the  common
              laboratory; can't support team efforts at off-campus work  sites; team
              discussion interferes with, or are inhibited by, other  students using the same
              common laboratory. "Virtual laboratories"  using leading edge technologies are
              proposed to provide flexible,  portable LANs with effective collaborative
              software to provide any  time/any place laboratory support for software
              development teams.  This approach will fundamentally alter the way team
              software  development is taught.
