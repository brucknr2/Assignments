Abstract    :
              This project is intended to help the ethnically and culturally  diverse
              community served by Miami-Dade Community College improve  scientific skills by
              assisting physics students and high school  physics teachers. In order to help
              our students improve their  understanding and applications of physics, they
              will be introduced  to a series of laboratory experiences using computers and
              video  technology. It is our expectation that in the process of doing  science,
              students will develop computer skills as well. In addition  to formal
              laboratory settings, a separate facility, fully equipped  as a tutorial lab run
              by both instructors and peer tutors, will be  made available to physics
              students who need additional help. This  will enhance their understanding
              physics through active engagement  in their own learning in an environment that
              encourages them to  build and communicate their knowledge. The combination of
              formal  laboratories and tutorial services is expected to improve student 
              retention and achievement in science courses and to help students  develop
              higher levels of scientific literacy, analytical, and  computer skills.  MDCC
              is deeply committed to working with the  community, particularly with the
              public high school system. This  project will provide training for high school
              physics teachers in  the use of MBL laboratories as well as in the adaptation
              and  development of new laboratory experiences.
