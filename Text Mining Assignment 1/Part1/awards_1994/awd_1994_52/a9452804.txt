Abstract    :
              9452804  Larson  A consortium of Native leaders and educational agencies and 
              institutions will implement recommendations from a  colloquium series for
              development of pedagogical approaches  which integrate indigenous knowledge
              with Western knowledge  to improve the science and mathematics education of
              students  in rural villages.  The consortium will provide an  opportunity for
              the population, particularly the Native  population, to formulated a renewed
              educational agenda,  which will impact the involvement of all segments of
              Native  society in science and mathematics knowledge and  instruction.
