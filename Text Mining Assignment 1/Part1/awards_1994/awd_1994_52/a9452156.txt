Abstract    :
              9452156  Diehl                                                              
              Twenty-two Macintosh Quadra 610 workstations are set up to serve  courses in
              Statistical Methods and Experimental Psychology.  Four  more are for use
              primarily by students in Cognitive Psychology and  those engaged in Independent
              Research and Honors Research courses.  In addition to extending the repertoire
              of statistical tests that  can be taught, availability of computers in
              laboratory instruction  makes possible the transition from passive observation
              of  demonstrations to active involvement in data collection and  analysis, and,
              ultimately, to the design and implementation of  student-generated research
              projects.
