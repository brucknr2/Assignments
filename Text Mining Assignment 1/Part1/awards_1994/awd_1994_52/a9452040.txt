Abstract    :
              The project incorporates a "Self-Electro-Optic-Effect Device  Laboratory" (SEED
              Lab) into the existing Photonics B.S. degree  program at the SUNY Institute of
              Technology. The SEED Lab allows  undergraduate photonics technologists to
              evaluate prototype  optoelectronic switching and logic devices invented by AT&T
              Bell  Laboratories. Students conduct laboratory experiments illustrating  set
              up requirements, operating characteristics (including dynamic  behavior) of
              single devices, and performance of interconnected  devices and arrays of
              devices. A laboratory manual detailing these  experiments is available.
