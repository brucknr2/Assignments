Abstract    :
              9452583  D'Alessandris                        The main goal of this project is
              to improve the learning,  retention, and application of physics concepts and
              principles by  students enrolled in physics classes at Monroe Community College
               (MCC). This will be accomplished by developing a comprehensive,  four-semester
              physics laboratory sequence based on the physics  education and cognitive
              research based curriculum of Real-Time  Physics. This curriculum relies upon
              the integration of  microcomputers into the laboratory to perform data
              collection,  analysis, and graphing, as well as to construct, execute, and 
              display simulations of physical phenomenon.  However, some units of Real-Time
              Physics are not yet commercially  available and, even when completed, Real-Time
              Physics will not  provide a comprehensive laboratory curriculum. Therefore,
              aspects  of other curricula, including Workshop Physics, Tools for  Scientific
              Thinking and Spreadsheet Physics will be integrated with  Real-Time Physics
              into a four-semester laboratory curriculum.  This project will encourage
              students to continue study in physics  or engineering, help prepare MCC physics
              courses for the next  century, and to stimulate other colleges, both two-year
              and  four-year, to adopt this approach.
