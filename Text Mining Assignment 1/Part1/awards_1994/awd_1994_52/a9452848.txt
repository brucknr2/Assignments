Abstract    :
              9452848  Taylor    This three year project is to establish a network of
              students,  teachers, researchers and volunteers to investigate various aspects 
              of the monarch butterfly migration phenomenon.  A curriculum is  proposed that
              will encompass the biology of monarchs, the migration  research and
              experimental, hands on activities along with authentic  research for children
              in grades K-12.  Two groups, each of which  includes numerous classroom
              teachers are engaged in developing the  curriculum; Dr. Karen Oberhauser and
              her team at the University of  Minnesota will develop activities and materials
              appropriate to the  lower grades and Dr. Orley Taylor and Mr. Brad Williamson
              at the  University of Kansas will develop activities and materials  appropriate
              for secondary level students.  Project dissemination  will be by the Internet
              and professional meetings.  End products of  this project include a Monarch
              Handbook and supporting  instructional videotapes.
