Abstract    :
              9452176  Klotz  The aim of this proposal is to infuse quantitative and
              experimental  investigations into field and environmental biology courses at
              the  institution. Students utilize modern techniques to study a diverse  array
              of species, investigate natural processes in different  habitats, and examine
              how human impact may be influencing them. The  acquisition of field equipment
              allows for the quantification of  experiments, a determination of plant and
              animal diversity, image  analyses, and allows students to learn modern
              techniques and  concepts in quantitative species identification. Other
              computers  and appropriate software enable students to experiment with an 
              electronic identification system and to add their field collections  to a
              databased inventory.  The project is also expected to impact  approximately 900
              students per year in 14 courses.
