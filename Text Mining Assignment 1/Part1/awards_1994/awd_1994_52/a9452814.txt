Abstract    :
              9452814  Sproat      ABSTRACT    South Carolina Educational Television Network
              will secure rights for one additional PBS broadcast plus three additional years
              of off-air recording for educational purposes.  In 1990, NSF awarded $367,430
              to the South Carolina Educational Network toward production and dissemination
              of a television series entitled, "Spaceship Earth."  The series takes a
              satellite's-eye view of the Earth, providing a unified look at the rich variety
              and interdependency of life and land on our planet.  Topics considered in the
              programs include:  an overview of a new global geography, population, earth's
              crust, world markets, weather, seas and oceans, rivers, forests, food, and "the
              watchkeepers," Earth's inhabitants who are responsible for its well-being.     
              That series was completed and broadcast over a three year period.  During that
              time it attract large general audiences and was widely used in schools.  There
              is continued interest is use of the series, however, broadcast and off-air
              taping rights have expired.  South Carolina Educational Television also will
              develop and disseminate promotional material to alert audiences and teachers of
              the continued availability of the project.
