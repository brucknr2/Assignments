Abstract    :
              9452296  Creasy                                                         An
              inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrophotometer  (ICP), a shatter
              box for grinding samples, and a microwave digester  for sample dissolution are
              allowing for the quantitative chemical  analyses of waters, soils, and rocks in
              an undergraduate  curriculum.  The ICP is uniquely adapted to the multi-element
               analytical needs of our project-oriented curriculum.  Students in  geology are
              studying a wide range of geochemical processes through  field and laboratory
              research at all levels in the curriculum.  The  addition of the ICP is
              allowing: (1) introduction of a new  geochemistry course; (2) development of
              new field- and  laboratory-based analytical projects in existing courses
              (aqueous  geochemistry, petrology, and hydrogeology) and in two current field 
              courses and; (3) expanded opportunities for independent student  research.  The
              ICP permits students to obtain whole-rock chemical  analyses and thus adds a
              dimension to their interpretation of  petrologic processes.  Students at Bates
              College address problems  in environmental geochemistry through courses and
              research  opportunities offered by faculty in geology and chemistry.  The ICP 
              reinforces existing interdepartmental connections and the  interdisciplinary
              nature of research.
