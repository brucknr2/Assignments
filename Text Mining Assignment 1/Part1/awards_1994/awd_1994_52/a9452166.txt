Abstract    :
              9452166  Nelson  Given the increasing relevance of distributed network
              environments  and the social needs they serve, distributed programming skills 
              should become part of the undergraduate computer science  curriculum. This
              proposal requests hardware to form a dedicated  laboratory for distributed
              computing, consisting of ten networked  workstations. This will support the
              addition of three courses in  the regular curriculum, Computer Networks and
              Concurrency Control  and Recovery, and a senior level projects course. Because
              students  will require system level access to the equipment, this laboratory 
              must be isolable through a bridge from a larger departmental and  campus
              network to which it will be connected.  The class Computer  Networks will
              concentrate on low-level network programming, often  at the packet level. The
              Concurrency Control and Recovery will  address distributed programming at a
              higher level by concentrating  on the implementation of algorithms from the
              distributed database  tradition. The third class will be a senior projects
              course in  which students realize novel network services typically requiring 
              the execution of remote cooperating clients.
