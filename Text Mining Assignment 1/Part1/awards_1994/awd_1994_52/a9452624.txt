Abstract    :
              9452624  Movasseghi  CUNY Medgar Evers College is establishing an advanced
              mathematics  computer laboratory for instruction in the calculus sequence and 
              higher level mathematics courses. The laboratory is staffed by a  full-time
              laboratory technician, presently on the staff of the  Department of
              Mathematics. The labs are being supervised by a part  time lab technician
              during the evenings and on Saturdays. The ends  for hiring this staff member
              are requested in this proposal. The  laboratory is being used as a teaching
              classroom as well as a  working laboratory, permitting instruction to take
              place there or  in other existing laboratory for courses that including 
              precalculus, calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, and  other
              higher level mathematics courses. In particular, minority  students who make up
              a large component of the student body, are  being prepared for careers in
              mathematics, engineering, and science  related fields.  With the acquisition of
              new equipment and  utilization of Mathematica and Maple, they are demonstrating
               important ideas for mathematics courses and allowing students to  experiment
              and discover mathematics for themselves. In addition,  students are learning
              two powerful software which is better  preparing them for their professional
              careers.
