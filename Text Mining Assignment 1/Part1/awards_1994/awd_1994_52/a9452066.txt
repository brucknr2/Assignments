Abstract    :
              9452066  Mehta  To enable the mathematics and computer science faculty of Saint 
              Xavier University to incorporate technology into their courses and  to better
              serve their commitment to collaborative learning, they  plan to create a
              departmental computer center consisting of two  laboratory classrooms. These
              classrooms will be dedicated to closed  laboratory instruction. Goals of this
              project include the  attraction of more mathematics and computer science majors
              and  greater retention in all mathematics and computer science courses.  Based
              on the results of a recently conducted pilot study, the  faculty expects
              increased use of technology in a supervised setting  (i.e., closed labs) to
              enable students to focus on mathematical and  algorithmic concepts.  The pilot
              study was successful to the extent  that current University computer resources
              allowed. In order to  expand the mathematics and computer science curricula the
               department has two dedicated local area networks, each consisting  of twenty
              computers. One contains Macintosh Quadras with an Apple  Workgroup server,
              while the other consists of Hewlett Packard 486  PCs. The labs are adjoined by
              a common resource and work area. Each  lab is equipped with a projection device
              as well as the software  necessary to accomplish networking and instruction.
              The faculty  also requests computers for developmental use in their offices.
