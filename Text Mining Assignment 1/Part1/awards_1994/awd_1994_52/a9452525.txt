Abstract    :
              9452525  Dorf                                 Traditionally, computer software
              development courses have produced  projects with small numbers of homogeneous
              users requiring limited  maintenance and which run on a single platform as
              opposed to  products which are distributed to large numbers of diverse users, 
              run on multiple platforms, and which are upgraded and re-released  many times.
              This proposal focuses on establishing a software  product development
              laboratory in an effort to provide students  with the product development
              experience that many will need upon  graduation. Initially, the laboratory will
              be for development and  maintenance of a multimedia student/campus directory
              for  distribution and use by the students and staff of The University of 
              Toledo and possibly other institutions. This user population will  force
              development for multiple platforms and provide a significant  user population
              for evaluation of the product. Due to the amount of  information and the
              variety of queries to be supported, database  engineering will be a significant
              factor in the development of the  product. To provide this expertise, Software
              Engineering and  Database Systems classes will be required to work together to 
              design a solution.  The first year a basic, but usable, product will be
              developed and  distributed on campus. The following year's Software Engineering
               and Database Systems students will be required to maintain the  previously
              distributed product by providing bug fixes and enhancing  its capabilities.
              This software product development laboratory will  provide the facilities for a
              realistic development experience.
