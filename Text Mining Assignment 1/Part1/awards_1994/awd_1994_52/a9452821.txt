Abstract    :
              9452821  Sanders    The University of New Haven seeks to provide an innovative 
              enrichment program in engineering to introduce 42 high potential  and high
              ability minority, female and other students entering  grades 11 and 12 to
              educational and career opportunities in  manufacturing. The program is
              structured to provide "hands-on"  experiences in the use of computerized
              integration and controlled  manufacturing and robotics, as well as to teach
              basic research  methods and ethics. The program is in two four-week sessions
              with  follow-up activities during the academic year.
