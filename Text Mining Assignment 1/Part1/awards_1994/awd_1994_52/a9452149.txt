Abstract    :
              9452149  Roat  Changes recently undertaken in the Washington College Chemistry 
              curriculum are designed to move students towards the recognition  and
              understanding of molecular structure through innovative  reorganization of
              chemistry core course materials and their  correlation with meaningful
              discovery-based laboratory experiences.  When fully implemented this program
              will reinforce understanding of  molecular structure, and its relationship to
              chemical reactivity,  using experimental structural analyses made possible
              through the  extensive use of high-field nuclear magnetic resonance 
              spectrometry. Students will discover the implications of  theoretical and
              practical aspects of nmr spectroscopy as it is used  to investigate molecular
              structure in our core curriculum. Higher  levels of sophistication in theory 
              and hands-on experimentation  take place as students continue in the chemistry
              curriculum.   Chemistry majors undertaking individualized research projects are
               also benefitting from availability of a high field nmr  spectrometer.
