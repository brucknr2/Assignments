Abstract    :
              9452497  Blackwell                                                 This proposal
              covers the development and implementation of an  undergraduate laboratory to
              support the teaching of a course in  Surface Mount Technology (SMT). SMT is the
              prevailing technology  used by major electronic circuit board manufacturers,
              whether their  board production is captive, that is for use in their own
              products,  or they are a contract circuit board manufacturer for others who 
              will assemble the board into a product.  SMT must use a concurrent  engineering
              approach to the design, manufacturing, and testing of  a device. This lab will
              demonstrate these principles by not only  allowing the students to manufacture
              circuit boards using both SMT  and through-hole principles and devices, but
              also by allowing the  students to observe, through the requested
              instrumentation, the  results of errors in the process.  The course and lab is
              also  intended to educate the target audience of electrical engineering 
              technology students as to actual uses for the courses in heat  transfer,
              strain, and chemistry they have taken but wondered what  to do with. Principles
              from these areas will be applied during this  course to both predict and
              demonstrate issues such as heat  transfer, cracking of solder joints and the
              results of using an  incorrect solder paste mixture.  This project is intended
              to be  used as a demonstration to the engineering education community the 
              value of teaching SMT at the undergraduate level. To that end the  results will
              be disseminated to that community, as will updates as  progress continues past
              the term of the grant.
