Abstract    :
              9452344  Nwankpa                                                          The
              interconnected power system laboratory is designed to give the  student an
              understanding of the important phenomena exhibited when  operating and
              controlling modern day power systems. The main  feature of this laboratory is
              that it uses real generators,  transformers, motors, loads and relays
              interconnected through  transmission lines to form a power system which
              operates at a  frequency of 6O Hz and voltage level of 22O V.  Experience
              gained  at working in such a laboratory cannot be easily obtained using a 
              software simulation package. The power curriculum  has four   on-going
              laboratories for studying machines, protective relaying  systems, power
              electronics and high voltage, which are being  interconnected so that students
              have the ability to practically  learn about the dynamics and operation of the
              interconnected  components.  The system is monitored and controlled via a set
              of  personal computers (PCs), which emulates an energy management  system (EMS)
              and remote terminal units (RTUs). This allows the  student to obtain a good
              understanding of the dynamics of the  system, its limitations and methods of
              control. In essence a  reduced version of an actual modern-day EMS center for a
              power  utility is at the hands of the student.
