Abstract    :
              The College of Mount St. Vincent is seeking to enrich teaching and  learning in
              the biology laboratory through the addition of  Macintosh microcomputers.  In
              many courses in biology, the mastery  of content has taken precedence over
              enhanced competence in  critical thinking and integration. Laboratories are
              highly  structured, with little opportunity for independent investigation  and
              analytical thinking by the students. Compounding these  problems, students
              display a decline in the level of preparedness  for learning biology, and
              possess a variety of learning modes that  render traditional instructional
              methods less effective.  In an  attempt to overcome these shortcomings, we seek
              to introduce  contemporary computers and multimedia software into biology 
              laboratory education. The initial focus will be on the Physiology  laboratory,
              with use of the laboratory stations by students in  several other laboratory
              courses as well. Several laboratory  exercises in Physiology will be interfaced
              with the Macintosh  microcomputer for sophisticated data collection and
              analysis, with  additional simulations to allow students to extend and
              reinforce  the knowledge obtained through their hands-on work. Computer-based 
              learning materials will be used to help students develop  problem-solving
              skills as well as content mastery. Multimedia  software programs will be used
              to help the student to organize  information, and to form cognitive links
              between various content  areas explored in lecture and laboratory.
