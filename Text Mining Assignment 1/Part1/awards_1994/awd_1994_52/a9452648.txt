              representatives of small, land-based tribes in Eastern  California, Southern
              Nevada, and Western Arizona.  The  coalition will include representatives from
              state and  private agencies concerned with American Indian education.  The PI

              connections, examine the implications  of systemic reform, and identify an
              executive committee  structure to begin preparation for writing and submission
              of  a Development project proposal.
