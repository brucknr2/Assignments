Abstract    :
              9452815  Canton    The dilemma of student retention has always plagued
              educational  institutions, especially community colleges.  Although many 
              community colleges directs some of its efforts toward student  retention, many
              such efforts are, at best fragmented and ill  planned.  This has also happened
              in the initiation of mentoring  programs developed by community colleges to
              combat the problem of  high dropout rates, especially among minority students. 
              Thus, the  purpose of this proposal is to develop a "Mentoring Guide for 
              Community Colleges."    This guide will be designed as a resource to assist
              administrators,  faculty, staff, students and other decision makers to
              understand  the factors involved in developing a planned mentoring program.  
              The "Mentoring Guide for Community Colleges" will be developed and  written by
              Dr. Marcia Canton and Dr. David James and edited by Mr.  William Brescia. 
              Among the major objectives of the guide are the  following: (1) essential
              components of a planned mentor program and  (2) specific examples of successful
              mentor programs in community  colleges as well as potential pitfalls that can
              lead to the demise  of mentor programs.    The projected outcome of this
              proposal is the production and  distribution of 5,000 "Mentoring Guides for
              Community Colleges," of  which 1,000 copies of the "Mentoring Guides for
              Community  Colleges," will be provided to the National Science Foundation.
