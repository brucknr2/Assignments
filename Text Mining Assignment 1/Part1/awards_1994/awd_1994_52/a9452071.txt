Abstract    :
              Recent studies have uncovered a disconcerting deficiency in the  ability of
              physics students to conceptualize motion concepts.  This  problem is most acute
              with lower level students who usually have  weak mathematical skills. 
              Conceptual confusion further complicates  the problems.  Too often the end
              result of this frustration is an  unwillingness to put forth the necessary
              effort.  Consequently,  introductory physics classes tend to considerably
              shrink the pool  of disadvantaged students who can enter engineering technology
               fields or even become technically literate.  We will immerse the low-level and
              disadvantaged students in a lab  environment and allow them to learn physics by
              grappling first with  concepts and then building upon that learning so that
              they can  better handle algebraic solutions.  This will be done by 
              implementing microcomputer-based labs and adopting the Workshop  Physics model
              of Laws to a technical physics environment.  It is  expected that as a result
              of this project more educationally  disadvantaged students will be able to
              handle the rigors of physics  and ultimately become accomplished engineering
              technicians.
