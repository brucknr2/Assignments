Abstract    :
              9452287  Bibby  We will develop an optics laboratory to teach modern applied 
              optical techniques to a spectrum of students ranging from Physics  majors to
              Electrical and Mechanical Engineering majors.  The  technical focus of this
              project is on optical signal processing and  on the use of interferometry.  The
              experiments that will be  developed will emphasize interferometry in optical
              metrology and  include holography and fiber optics.  Two categories of students
               will benefit from this project--  upper-level Physics students, who  are
              taking the main sequence of optics related lab courses, and  students from
              other disciplines such as Electrical Engineering,  Mechanical Engineering and
              Materials, and Geo-Environmental  Engineering, who seek to learn applied optics
              as a tool to solve  problems in various branches of engineering.  Recent
              advances in  applied optics offer new tools which these students can use to 
              approach a variety of technical challenges.
