Abstract    :
              9452009  Romanishin                      An old (1930's vintage),
              hard-to-operate 10 inch Newtonian  telescope will be replaced with a modern
              teaching telescope and  electronic imaging camera.  The new telescope will be
              used to  enhance the teaching of astronomy and technology at both the 
              introductory non-science major survey course and at the senior 
              astronomy/astrophysics major level.  The new electronic imaging  camera will
              allow even non-science students to record simple  observations that they can
              look at and manipulate using a computer.   There is a new student computer lab
              in the Physics Department which  will allow participation in these activities
              by all students.  This  equipment, although simple enough for introductory
              students to use  under supervision, will be powerful enough that the
              junior/senior  astronomy/astrophysics majors will be able to obtain data that
              they  will be able to analyze in a more sophisticated manner, to  illustrate
              important aspects of observational astronomy in a real  "hands-on" approach not
              now possible.
