Abstract    :
              9452441  Wikle  This project targets the implementation of an undergraduate
              field  program in the use of global positioning system (GPS) technology. 
              Instrumentation includes GPS receivers and laptop computers for  data logging.
              The equipment is also being utilized by geography and  forestry majors and
              students from other natural resource programs  taking courses in Physical
              Geography, Computer Cartography, Remote  Sensing, Geographic Information
              Systems, Field Techniques, Forest  Mensuration, and Aerial Photogrammetry. Two
              main objectives are  stressed, namely introducing GPS field equipment to
              students  enrolled in a general education geography course and allowing upper 
              division students to integrate state-of-the-art system  technologies.  The
              proposed GPS field program is also expected to  serve as a prototype to test
              new curricula and as a model for  similar geography programs at other
              institutions.
