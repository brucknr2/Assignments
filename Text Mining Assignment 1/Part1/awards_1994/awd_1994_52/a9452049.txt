Abstract    :
              9452049  Cassidy                              A thermal analysis system is
              providing students operational  experience with this technique in several
              courses, thereby  enhancing the contents of the courses and introducing 
              state-of-the-art technology.  These courses include Polymer  Chemistry and
              Engineering, a new course in 1992, one not commonly  available in undergraduate
              curricula, Physical Chemistry, and a new  course in 1994 for SWT, a
              senior-level, integrated laboratory  sequence.  The first and third of these
              are somewhat unusual and a  creative step to give undergraduates an opportunity
              for extensive  laboratory work with modern equipment.  Two modules are being
              used:  Thermogravimetric Analyzer (TGA) and  Differential Scanning Calorimeter
              (DSC).  Students are instructed  on these instruments and then actually operate
              each of them instead  of merely hearing lectures on them or observing their
              applications  at regional laboratories.  An additional challenge grant has been
              committed by a local  industry to support the proposed special thermal analysis
               laboratory.
