Abstract    :
              9452675  Carluccio      The Central Connecticut State University will initiate a
              three-  week, residential, multi-disciplinary Young Scholars project which 
              will provide science enrichment activities for 50 students entering  grades 9
              and 10. This summer program will emphasize research  participation in biology,
              chemistry, the earth sciences, and  physics. The students will be involved in a
              combination of  laboratory and field experiences and experiments, a research 
              project, demonstrations, lectures and discussions to encourage  participants to
              pursue careers in science and engineering  education. The program provides
              intensive interdisciplinary  exposure to science concepts and methods as
              students design and  conduct their own experiments.
