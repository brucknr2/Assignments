Abstract    :
              9452597  Loxsom                                                    The general
              curriculum, introductory, and upper division courses in  physics, geology and
              mathematics will be revised so that they  introduce and use a common set of
              computational software tools as  an integral part of their instructional
              activities. This  development process will seek to duplicate the success
              achieved by  the revision of laboratory courses in physics (including general 
              curriculum, introductory, upper division and research courses) so  that they
              now introduce and use, in a systematic and coherent  manner, a set of
              data-acquisition and data analysis software tools  (Lab VIEW, Kaleidagraph, and
              IGOR). In the project described here  we will use five computational tools: a
              simulation package  (STELLA), a statistical package (Mini tab), a numerical
              calculation  program (Mat Lab), a symbolic algebra package (Mathematica) and a 
              programming language (C++). We will integrate these packages into  the physics,
              geology and mathematics curricula at all levels.  Students involved in research
              in all three departments will use  these software tools. A major outcome of the
              project is that the  faculty and students in physics, geology and mathematics
              will share  ideas for improving science education.
