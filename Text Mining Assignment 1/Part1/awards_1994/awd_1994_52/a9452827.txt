Abstract    :
              9452827  Kernell    The Old Dominion University seeks to initiate a four-week, 
              residential, Young Scholars program in applied physics and  engineering for 22
              students entering grades 9 and 10. The project  provides students the
              opportunity to become acquainted with the  subject content of applied physics
              and explore a variety of careers  in several areas of physical science and
              engineering that involve  substantial applications to physics. Experiences
              include classroom  instruction, hands-on laboratory activities, field trips,
              and small  group research projects mentored by university members. The project 
              provides supportive relationships to participants, offers  information on
              career opportunities and academic requirements, and  helps participants build a
              foundation for success in applied  physics, engineering, and related fields.
