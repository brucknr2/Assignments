Abstract    :
              9452615  Mahdi  The University of Texas Pan-American (UTPA) has applied to the 
              Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board (THECB) to expand from  the 2 year
              Pre-Engineering program to 4 year Baccalaureate programs  in Mechanical,
              Electrical and Manufacturing Engineering. The  application was approved by
              THECB on April 24, 1992. This proposal  is for the development of an
              undergraduate laboratory in heat  transfer to support the Mechanical
              Engineering Program. The  proposed grant will provide the financial resources
              in order to  purchase the following equipment: 1) conduction heat transfer 
              apparatuses, to investigate conduction in solids, 2) 6-pass heat  exchangers,
              to determine the heat transfer characteristics of heat  exchangers under
              various flow conditions, 3) temperature measuring  units, to investigate the
              characteristics of several temperature  measuring devices, 4) boiling heat
              transfer units, to study the  different modes of boiling, 5) bench top cooling
              towers, to  investigate their operation 6) thermal radiation units, to 
              investigate the laws of thermal radiation and 7) convection heat  transfer
              units, to study free and forced convection. The proposed  laboratory will be an
              integral part of the MECE 3360/MECE 3160 Heat  Transfer course which is
              required for all mechanical engineering  majors. The laboratory will
              illustrate/reinforce the concepts  covered in class. Its main emphasis and
              effort will be placed on  gaining information from the experiments,
              experiencing the trials  and tribulations of experimentation and not simply
              demonstrate  physical principles.
