Abstract    :
                9452769  Haines-Stiles    "Passport to Knowledge" takes students from all
              across America on "electronic field trips" via television and computer
              networks.  Students join research scientists as they conduct their activities
              in environments typically inaccessible to the younger population.  This is made
              possible through the use of television, VCRs, computers, CD-ROMs, modems,
              satellites and telephone lines. Using these media students will become involved
              in places such as the Antarctic, the Amazon Rainforest and the Hubble Space
              Telescope.  Some students  will be able to interact with scientists live,
              others via Internet.  All will be able to monitor and correspond with the
              scientists as they make entries in their Field Journals.  The broadcasts will
              be distributed over public television stations and other satellite educational
              networks so they will be accessible to schools at no cost.  Thus, Passport to
              Knowledge will deliver contemporary science through face to face encounters
              with distant and exotic places and phenomena and the privileged women and men
              exploring them, using a powerful combination of television, print and on-line
              computer technologies to inform, inspire, motivate and educate.  ***
