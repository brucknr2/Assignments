Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a FT-IR spectrophotometer  for use in
              Organic Chemistry and General Chemistry courses. The  instrument is enabling
              the department to introduce environmental  investigations into the curriculum
              and redesign the general  chemistry course to include a broader introduction to
              the field of  organic chemistry.  Students majoring in non-science disciplines 
              are benefiting also by use of modern instrument technology to  investigate
              natural phenomena.
