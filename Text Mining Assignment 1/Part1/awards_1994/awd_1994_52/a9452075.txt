Abstract    :
              9452075  Ralston                                            This project
              involves a behavioral analysis laboratory (BAL), that  supports general
              experimental psychology and other classes.  Experimental psychology is an
              introductory class with a large  enrollment of psychology majors and non
              majors. In addition, the  BAL is available to other undergraduate psychology
              students and  classes to conduct independent study and research. More 
              specifically, one portion of the BAL supports general computing,  simulations
              of physiological and psychological processes, and  studies of human subjects.
              Another aspect of the BAL provides  instrumentation for exercises with animals
              to demonstrate  principles of operant conditioning. The development of the BAL
              has  also greatly improved the quality of instruction within the  institution.
