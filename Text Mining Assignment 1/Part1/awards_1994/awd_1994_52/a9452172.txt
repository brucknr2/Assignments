Abstract    :
              Western Carolina University is seeking to improve its existing  Electron
              Microscope Facility through the purchase of specimen  preparation equipment
              including a micro tome, diamond knife, and  resin oven as well as a
              critical-point dryer, sputter coater, and  energy dispersive x-ray detection
              system. The equipment will be  used primarily in undergraduate education and
              research in the  Department of Biology, although other disciplines will also be
               affected. A new course, "Techniques in Electron Microscopy" has  been
              implemented in order to instruct students in the theory and  use of the
              requested equipment.
