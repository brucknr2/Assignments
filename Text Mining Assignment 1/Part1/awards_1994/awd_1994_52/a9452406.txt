Abstract    :
              9452406  Mendez                                       This project is designed
              to encourage women to study science.  We  will make our introductory and
              conceptual physics laboratories more  conducive to our female students in three
              ways: 1) increasing  self-confidence and hands-on experience by using computer
              assisted  data collection and adopting several assignments developed by 
              Priscilla Laws and the Workshop Physics Group at Dickenson College;  2)
              relating abstract concepts to the real world by using a  microcomputer video
              digitizer to digitize videos and then analyzing  them to make quantitative
              measurements; and 3) decreasing the  feeling of isolation and introducing our
              students to the powerful  tool of networking by having our students collaborate
              on  experiments with physics students at Randolph-Macon Woman's College 
              through the Internet computer network.
