Abstract    :
              9452580  Elenbogen                                                 The project
              will construct a parallel and distributed computer  laboratory, running the
              Linda parallel language on a SUN  workstation network. The Linda programming
              language construct  support various models parallelism and are supported by a
              variety  of base languages. In particular Joyce and C will be supported. The 
              laboratory would be devoted to a course in parallel and distributed  algorithm
              development. This course is based on the ACM-IEEE course  AL9 as part of its
              1991 computing curricula. During class time,  students would individually view
              demonstrations of parallel  algorithms using a windowed environment to simulate
              several  different architectures. Students would be able to individually  view
              the algorithms at their own pace. Outside of class, students  would write their
              own parallel and distributed algorithms, using  Linda. Projects and
              demonstrations would make use of Linda's  graphical debugging tool to view
              simultaneously the entire state of  all processes as well as the data movement.
              Labs would be developed  and made available which could be used at other
              institutions to  teach their own parallel and distributed programming courses.
