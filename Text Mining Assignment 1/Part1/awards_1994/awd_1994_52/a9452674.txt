Abstract    :
              9452674  Elkhader    Northern State College seeks to initiate a comprehensive, 
              residential program, called South Dakota Native American  Mathematics
              Enhancement (SDNAME), consisting of a four-week  summer enrichment institute
              for 30 high potential Lakota/Dakota  students in grades 10 and 11.  SDNAME is
              targeted at native  American students, half of which will be female.  Students
              will  participate in activities and experiments involving discrete 
              mathematics, game theory, and mathematical biology.  The goals of  the proposed
              project are to: develop students' interest in  mathematics; build a peer group
              interest in mathematics; and  raise self confidence and encourage the study of
              mathematics or  mathematics-dependent fields.  ***
