Abstract    :
              9452436  Near                                 Seven years ago the publication of
              Toward a Lean and Lively  Calculus (1986) launched a significant reform of the
              nation's  calculus curriculum, however, comparable reform has not been 
              generally introduced in technical mathematics. Technical  mathematics is
              designed for students in associate degree programs  such as architectural
              construction, computer information systems,  electrical/electronics technology,
              energy technology, industrial  drafting, manufacturing engineering, and
              robotics. It is the only  college math course taken by approximately 100,000 of
              the nation's  community college students prior to their entry in the workplace.
               This project ties in with an award to Henry Ford Community College  by Fund
              for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education (FIPSE) to  incorporate the
              National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM)  Standards in the technical
              mathematics sequence. Henry Ford  Community College's pilot program also
              creates a context for  cooperation between career education faculty and
              mathematics  faculty in the development of applied real-life problems that are 
              being used as activities within the redesigned course.  Representatives from
              companies such as Ford Motor, AC Delco, and  Kerr Manufacturing are
              participating in designing Activities that  incorporate industrial
              applications. The activities use  computer-assisted programs such as MathCad
              and Geometer's Sketchpad  to encourage students to collect evidence, to problem
              solve, and to  work collaboratively.
