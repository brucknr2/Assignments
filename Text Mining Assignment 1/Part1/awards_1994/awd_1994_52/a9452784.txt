Abstract    :
              9452784  Smith    This two year project is to develop a CD-ROM based curriculum
              that  will provide a community of learners an opportunity to solve real-  world
              problems.  With Culver Productions as a base of operations,  the development
              process will involve a known group of science  educators including Global
              Rivers Environmental Education Network  (GREEN), University of Michigan, and
              Paradyme Productions.   Students will identify problems based on watching a
              video  documentary that presents opposing facts and opinions and then  navigate
              through a rich database of video, text, graphics, GIS  maps, and simulations to
              develop startegies to solve problems.   Students will be guided through
              telecommunications to communicate  with other schools, contact public
              officials, or retrieve  government documents to develop their strategy.  Final
              results will  be evident in many forms including active debates and verbal 
              communications, hands-on research, and custom produced multimedia 
              presentations.  The curriculum, "Without Water," will help teach  students the
              role citizens play in the health of society and the  earth.
