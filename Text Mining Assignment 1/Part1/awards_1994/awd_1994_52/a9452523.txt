Abstract    :
              9452523  Sherwood  The mathematics faculty, supported by Penn Valley Community 
              College, is embarking on a general mathematics curriculum reform  effort in
              response to the changing needs of its clientele, the  community, and its
              transfer program. Students entering the  mathematics curriculum at each level
              are being provided with new  numeric, geometric and other mathematical
              experiences. The  community and transfer program demand graduates possessing
              greater  problem solving and communicative skills than is possible by the 
              traditional curriculum. To address these concerns the mathematics  faculty is
              establishing a computer laboratory which will provide  the needed experiences
              in a problem solving environment.
