Abstract    :
              9452476  Bustoz                                                    A networked
              computer laboratory classroom is devoted exclusively to  undergraduate
              instruction in mathematics.  Two types of courses are  affected: (1)  The
              laboratory is used to teach approximately 1,000  students per year in a course
              entitled "Calculus with Computers."   This course, which is aimed at
              non-technical majors, is a  replacement for College Algebra as a graduation
              requirement for  non-science students.  The course introduces most of the main
              ideas  of calculus using the DERIVE software package to do most of the 
              algebraic manipulations and to plot functions.  (2)  The Laboratory  is used to
              teach a new sequence of courses in calculus, ordinary  differential equations,
              and mathematical modeling that are tailored  to the needs of students in the
              biological and life sciences.  The  goal is to improve the mathematics
              background of these students,  who have traditionally taken only a one-semester
              course in  polynomial calculus.  Initially, about 100 students per year take 
              these courses.
