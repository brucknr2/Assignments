Abstract    :
              9452530  Franz  Lycoming College is acquiring capillary electrophoresis (CE) and
               high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) instrumentation for  use in
              upper level chemistry laboratories. The project has three  goals:  1  Expand
              chemistry and biology majors opportunities in  separation science;  2  Increase
              the use of discovery-based  experiments in the undergraduate curriculum;  3 
              Provide state-  of-the-art instrumentation for undergraduate research.
