Abstract    :
              9452440  Zoellner                                              The project will
              introduce a course which details computational  chemistry at the senior
              undergraduate level, providing chemistry  majors with "hands-on" experience
              with the computational tools and  techniques already indispensable to the
              academic and industrial  researcher. To meet this need, the department will
              initiate a  senior-level undergraduate course in computational chemistry (CHM 
              410), which is designed to teach both basic principles and methods,  and, in
              some depth, how to use computational techniques to solve  chemical problems.
              Techniques to be addressed in the course include  molecular mechanics,
              semi-empirical, and ab initio methods, as well  as how to analyze a chemical
              problem so as to choose the  computational method best suited to an efficient
              solution given the  constraints of local computational power and clock time. To
               successfully initiate such a course, two computer workstations  (Silicon
              Graphics IRIS Indigo workstations or equivalent) and an  up-grade in memory to
              an existing Indigo workstation will be  purchased. In addition, a site license
              for the X-windows  modification of the program Spartan (which includes
              molecular  mechanics, semi-empirical, and ab initio modules) so as to allow 
              the efficient use of the workstations through the existing  College-funded
              computer laboratory, will also be obtained.
