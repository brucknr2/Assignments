Abstract    :
              9452080  Markowski                                                 The MSU-CIM
              project is designed to enhance laboratory instruction  in a broad range of
              undergraduate courses by integration of product  and process designing,
              manufacturing, assembly and management  functions. The project integrates
              disciplines which are well  established in the Manufacturing Engineering
              department. This  project is being used for integration and modification of 
              curriculum in a variety of existing courses, and for development of  a new
              undergraduate course which demonstrates the fundamentals of  CIM by hands-on
              lab projects. The system uses three CNC machine  tools for machining a variety
              of products, and provides automatic  assembly of the product and inspection.
              With an automatic storage  and retrieval station and four robots, the entire
              manufacturing  process may be run fully automatically. Product design and
              process  planning is fully computerized and virtually-paperless. Creation  and
              use of databases is also an integral part of the project.
