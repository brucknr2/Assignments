Abstract    :
              9452697  Goldberg    Occidental College seeks to initiate a four week summer 
              residential Young Scholars project in mathematics for 32 students  in the
              northeast Los Angeles area entering grades eight through  ten.  The recruitment
              area is the attendance regions of the  eleven public high schools nearest the
              College.  Most students  are minority group members.  Students will actively
              participate  in the process of mathematical development: seeking patterns, 
              formulating conjectures, reasoning, writing and speaking.   Problems will be
              chosen from areas of discrete mathematics.   Students will use personal
              programmable graphing calculators.   Computer and science laboratory
              experiences will complement  mathematics workshops.  Academic year follow-up
              activities will  include class, lectures, career and college admission
              workshops,  field trips, and Science Fair participation.  Local scientists, 
              engineers and other professionals will visit the students.  ***
