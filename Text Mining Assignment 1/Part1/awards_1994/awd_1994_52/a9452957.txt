Abstract    :
              9452957  Dubinsky                                       A special issue of the
              journal Undergraduate Mathematics Education  Trends is being developed to
              inform the mathematics community about  the first decade of Calculus Reform. 
              The issue is being  disseminated to more than 70,000 individuals.  The articles
              for the  special issue will examine key issues of the Calculus Reform  movement
              and will range over its extent and effects, measures of  success, and basic
              questions of content, pedagogy, and technology.
