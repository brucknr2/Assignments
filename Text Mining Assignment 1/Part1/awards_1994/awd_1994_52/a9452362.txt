Abstract    :
              9452362  Waechter-Brulla                                           A new
              interdisciplinary course entitled "Science and Technology in  Society"
              integrates topics from all scientific disciplines. In the  lecture, we examine
              basic science concepts and processes,  technological advances and their impact
              on society. In the  discussion, we demonstrate how information is collected, 
              assimilated and understood via direct participation. Students will  use
              computers for data analysis and presentation; additional  computer-aided
              instructional materials will be used in both  discussion and lecture. This
              course will be required of all  undergraduate students, and it will enroll 800
              to 1000 students per  semester beginning in fall 1994. Undergraduate
              pre-service science  teachers will serve as course assistants and be present
              with the  faculty during the discussion sections. These undergraduate 
              assistants will also be available to assist the students with  interactive
              media homework assignments.  The course will serve as  a model for the
              UW-Whitewater campus and other comprehensive  universities through its unique
              interdisciplinary nature and its  exploitation of certain pedagogical elements:
              direct student  involvement, computer-aided instruction, computer-based data 
              analysis, multimedia enhanced lecture delivery.
