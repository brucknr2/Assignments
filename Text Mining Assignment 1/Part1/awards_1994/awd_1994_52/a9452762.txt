              to  produce interactive multimedia CD-ROM versions of existing and  future
              modules of Project MATHEMATICS!, a series of professional  broadcast-quality
              computer animated videotapes on various topics in  basic mathematics at the
              secondary level.  These topics range from  geometry to trigonometry. algebra,
              and modeling.  Information about  multimedia playback hardware, software tools,
              design, production,  and technical support is being gathered by examining
              existing  production tools and software, attending seminars and conferences, 
              interviewing and consulting knowledgeable colleagues and  representatives of
              appropriate companies, and studying trade  journals.
