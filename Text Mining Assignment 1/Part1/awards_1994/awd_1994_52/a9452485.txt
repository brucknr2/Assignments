Abstract    :
              9452485  Heilman  This project includes notebook computers and video equipment
              which  undergraduate students use as part of their field courses in urban 
              ethnography. Students take field notes in situ on the computers.  They use the
              computers to access archive material, the library and  to communicate
              (downloading reports) with the departmental network.  They also video the
              settings they observe. Written and visual  documents are then integrated,
              displayed, analyzed and archived at  a multi-media desktop site in the
              department. There students  examine one another's finished projects, using
              these to learn about  the various ethnic and urban landscapes they have
              documented. Final  products are  used both for teaching and as a models for a
              student  run and faculty mentored programs of urban ethnography.
