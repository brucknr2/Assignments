Abstract    :
              9452749  Keynes    The University of Minnesota seeks to initiate a
              comprehensive, year  round program, called PROJECT YES, of monthly academic
              year  activities followed by a four-week summer commuter enrichment  institute
              for 90 mathematically talented students in grades 7 and  8.  Project YES is
              primarily targeted at female students, students  of color, and economically
              disadvantaged students.  It presents  rich and diverse informational and
              enrichment activities to support  further study of mathematics and enhance
              interest in career  oppurtunities in mathematics and sciences.  A special
              feature of  the program would be an innovative two-week program at the NSF 
              supported Geometry Center featuring geometry, visualization, and  hands-on
              graphics exploration.  ***
