              Is the  Viability of Geoscience Education in Jeopardy as We Approach the  21st
              Century?    A Chapman Conference will be sponsored by the American Geophysical 
              Union (AGU) to be held September 7-11, 1994 in Washington, DC.  The  purpose of
              the conference is to bring together geoscientists from  diverse backgrounds to
              discuss and develop long-term plans to  improve the quality of undergraduate
              geoscience instruction,  including the disciplines of geology, geophysics,
              meteorology, and  oceanography.  Support is being used to assure representation
              at  the conference of faculty from all types of institutions.
