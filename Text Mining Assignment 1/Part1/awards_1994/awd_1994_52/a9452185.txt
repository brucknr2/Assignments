Abstract    :
              9452185  Niederriter                                               The focus of
              this grant is the creation of new experiments for our  course, The Physics and
              Chemistry of Materials. This course brings  together students who are majoring
              in chemistry and in physics and  has them explore the science and technologies
              of materials. The  laboratory exercises are designed to bridge the gap between 
              chemistry and physics by bringing out aspects of both disciplines  and having
              students synthesize their experiences by sharing their  backgrounds in both
              chemistry and physics.  Three new experiments  will be performed with equipment
              provided for this project, which  include two ultra-high vacuum stations and a
              scanning tunneling  microscope system. The experiments to be performed include
              a study  of the effects of oxygen plasma on polymer surfaces, vapor  deposition
              of metallic films, and a scanning tunnelling microscope  study of metal and
              semiconductor surfaces. Students will be taught  vacuum techniques, contact
              angle measurements, reflectance and  transmission spectroscopy, electrical
              resistance measurements, and  scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. 
              This project will  also have an impact on other courses in the Chemistry and
              Physics  Programs and on student-faculty research.
