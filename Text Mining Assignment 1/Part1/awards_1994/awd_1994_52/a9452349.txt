Abstract    :
              9452349  Young  The goals of this project involve expansion of spatial analysis 
              across the curriculum. Advanced undergraduate students develop the  analytical
              skills necessary for addressing a wide variety of  geographical problems.
              Computer-based instruction, with an emphasis  on the use of GIS/spatial
              analysis, is being introduced into six  advanced undergraduate courses. Also,
              this project will increase  the use of GIS/spatial analysis to 15 courses
              taught by seven of  our 11 faculty. The advanced GIS Laboratory is equipped
              with  microcomputers and a network and file server with a large hard  disk.
