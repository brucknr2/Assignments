Abstract    :
              9452486  Aktan                                Non-destructive testing procedures
              are included in a required  junior level course. The revised course addresses
              not only the  design of concrete and asphalt mixes and test procedures to 
              determine virgin properties of these materials, but also non-  destructive
              testing (NDT) procedures for determining the properties  of these materials in
              service.  The NDT procedures are: measuring  the infiltration and rate of
              infiltration of deicing salts into  concrete, mapping reinforcement topology in
              concrete, measurements  of corrosion activity in reinforcement, ultrasonic
              testing for flaw  determination, and acoustic emissions monitoring.
