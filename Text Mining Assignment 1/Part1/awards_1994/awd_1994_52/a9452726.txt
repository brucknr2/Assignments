Abstract    :
              9452726  Field    The University of Maine seeks to initiate a 4 week residential
               Young Scholars project in engineering for 24 students entering  grades 11 and
              12.  The project aims to stimulate interest in  engineering careers among the
              participants.  This will be  achieved by having the students; take part in
              on-going  engineering research projects; tour industrial sites and talk  with
              practicing engineers; receive an overview of career  opportunities in five
              engineering disciplines; take a minicourse  in Logic Systems; learn about
              ethics in an engineering setting;  and complete a follow-up project.  Students
              and teachers at each  participant's school will also become aware of
              engineering  through a presentation made by the participant that will also be 
              attended by the Project Director.   ***
