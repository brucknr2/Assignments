Abstract    :
              9452892  Boudjouk  Funds are requested to continue the effort in North Dakota to
              build a permanent infrastructure in science, engineering  and mathematics (SEM)
              that provides 1) incentives and means for researchers to compete effectively
              for merit-based  grants and contracts, 2) programs for students in grades 10 -
              16, and, 3) programs for  North Dakota businesses to  link with SEM talent at
              North Dakota University System colleges.    Key features of the Strategic
              Improvement Plan are: 1) Strengthening of existing and emerging research
              clusters with  potential to achieve national and international prominence.  Two
              clusters (Supramolecular Protein Complexes, Main  Group Chemistry), will
              continue to receive support, although at diminishing levels during the grant
              period.  Following   rigorous screening and evaluation, new clusters will be
              developed.    2) A multi-component program composed of: undergraduate research
              and mentoring programs; a program targeting  potential women scientists and
              another to facilitate the transition from high school science activities to
              undergraduate  research programs; pilot technology transfer programs linking
              students and faculty with local industries; and a  program to remove barriers
              to success in obtaining Human Resource Development and Systemic Reform grants. 
              Programs with North Dakota's Tribal Community Colleges: summer workshops for
              students, and academic year  workshops for faculty at our five Tribal Community
              Colleges.
