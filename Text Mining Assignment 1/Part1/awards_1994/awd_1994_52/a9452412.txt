Abstract    :
              The project renovates the Pomona College 1-meter telescope for  undergraduate
              research and class work.  Four faculty representing  all five of the Claremont
              Colleges will supervise undergraduate  research projects using the telescope.
              In addition, the colleges  offer introductory astronomy and an observational
              astronomy classes  that will also use the telescope.  The research projects
              include  observations of supernovae, imaging surveys of lenticular galaxies, 
              spectroscopy of variable stars, observations of clusters, mapping  of molecular
              clouds, and quasar photometry.
