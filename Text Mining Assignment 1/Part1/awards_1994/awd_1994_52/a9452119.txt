Abstract    :
              9452119  Cannon  Mississippi College is upgrading and expanding the program in
              biochemistry. This will include the  addition of an ACS chemistry major with a
              Biochemistry option. In order to accomplish this, a second  semester of
              biochemistry was added; molecular biology, medicinal chemistry or research will
              be available  as the advanced course. Biochemistry I Laboratory is being
              completely reorganized to include more  instrumentation and more modern
              techniques. The addition of a preparative ultracentrifuge and an  ultrasonic
              processor will make possible a variety of experiments to Biochemistry,
              Molecular Biology,  Microbiology, and Immunology laboratories. Experiments have
              been designed that involve both  differential and gradient centrifugation.
              Undergraduate research will be greatly enhanced due to the  availability of a
              wide range of projects made possible by this new facility. Such experience will
              lay a  better foundation for graduate school.
