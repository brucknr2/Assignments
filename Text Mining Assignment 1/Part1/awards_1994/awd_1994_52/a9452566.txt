Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to provide access to Global Positioning  Satellite
              (GPS) surveying technology to undergraduate surveying  students in both the BT
              (4-year) and AAS (2-year) surveying  programs at the institutions involved in
              the project. The project  involves the utilization of two dual-frequency,
              geodetic GPS  receivers as well as accompanying software and peripherals.  The 
              project  allows the development of new laboratory exercises in  several
              bachelor- and associate-level land surveying courses, and   allows for exposure
              of the technology to students in other programs  such as construction. Also,
              the project emphasizes dissemination of  state-of-the-art technology to
              undergraduate students at several  colleges.
