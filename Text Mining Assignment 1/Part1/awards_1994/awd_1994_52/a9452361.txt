Abstract    :
              9452361  Peroni  This proposal requests $42,325 for the purchase of MacIntosh 
              computers, software and accessory equipment to outfit a computer  facility for
              introductory biology. The computers are necessary for  the addition of
              investigative modules to the three course  introductory series for biology
              majors. Computers have not been  previously integrated into introductory
              courses at Davidson, except  on a very limited basis. Computer facilities
              appropriate to  introductory biology laboratory exercises are not currently 
              available on campus.    The research-based modules will be integrated into all
              three  introductory courses. All students passing through these courses  will
              then have exposure to: 1) exploring theoretical concepts using  computer
              simulations; 2) design and execution of small group  research projects; 3)
              critical thinking and writing exercises. This  introductory curriculum will
              prepare students for a more in-depth  exposure to investigative courses at the
              junior and senior level,  as well as to prepare them for independent research
              projects and  graduate school.    The computer facility will be used by all
              introductory students.  The introductory courses will seat approximately
              384-448 students  each year. Multiple sections of each course are offered each 
              semester.
