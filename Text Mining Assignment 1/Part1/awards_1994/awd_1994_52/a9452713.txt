Abstract    :
              9452713  Bersenyi                Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology seeks to
              initiate a four-week,  residential, Young Scholars project in the field of
              mathematics  which will offer science enrichment activities for 50 precollege 
              students entering grades 9, 10, 11, and 12. The program will  combine the
              summer residential project with a nine month  correspondence component. The
              program provides an intensive and  focused mathematical experience
              concentrating on group activities,  and on in-depth, methodical studies of
              selected mathematical areas,  including axiomatic set theory and combinatorics.
