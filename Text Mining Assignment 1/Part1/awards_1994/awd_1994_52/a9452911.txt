Abstract    :
              9452911  Huband  The American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) will
              publish  the results of NSF/DUE-sponsored research and innovation in 
              engineering education in ASEE's Journal of Engineering Education,  The
              Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers' (IEEE)  journal Transactions
              on Education, and other appropriate learned  journals.  In keeping with the
              scholarly spirit of these journals,  funding from NSF will assure valuable
              dissemination of the results  of NSF-funded research.  Thus, findings from
              NSF-funded research by  principal investigators in the field of engineering
              education would  be assured of the broadest possible dissemination in scholarly
               journals dedicated to expanding the body of knowledge that supports 
              engineering educators nation wide.
