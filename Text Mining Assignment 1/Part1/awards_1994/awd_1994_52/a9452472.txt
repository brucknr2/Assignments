Abstract    :
              9452472  Crowley                                                   Mathematics
              faculty at Lexington Community College are  incorporating a computer algebra
              system into their calculus  sequence. Each class meets three hours per week in
              a classroom for  lecture, and two times per week in a networked computer
              laboratory  with Maple to investigate mathematical concepts. Most of the time 
              in the laboratory is spent working on short problems that can be  reasonably
              completed during one class period. Students are also  expected to complete four
              or five larger laboratory projects that  involve multistep investigation of a
              concept. They work on these  projects for a week or more in assigned groups.
              Use of Maple for  calculus relieves students of some frustration with
              computations,  and allows instructors to expect students to concentrate on more
               conceptual questions. Less time is spent in traditional lectures,  and more
              time is spent graphing.  Performing algebraic  manipulations and computations
              is minimized.
