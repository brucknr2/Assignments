Abstract    :
              9452544  Grimley                                A Gas Chromatograph-Mass
              Spectrometer (GC/MS) System, including the  software to perform spectral
              searching of the Wiley Spectral  Library, is being used to significantly
              enhance the undergraduate  educational program in chemistry at Elon College and
              at four area  sister institutions (Bennett, Salem, and Guilford Colleges and
              High  Point University).  Students are gaining hands-on experience with  a
              powerful analytical instrumental technique.  Integration of the  use of the
              GC/MS throughout the curriculum is leading to: 1. the  demonstration of the
              basic concepts involved in determining the  molecular masses and structures of
              a wide variety of chemical  species; 2. the complementation of existing major
              instrumentation  by allowing integration of instrumental techniques throughout
              the  chemistry curriculum; 3. stimulation and enrichment of the  undergraduate
              experience, catalyzing the attraction of current and  prospective students to
              careers in scientific fields, and the  opening of additional career
              opportunities for students in the  sciences; 4. the updating of courses and the
              reinforcement of the  high level of faculty commitment to the continued
              development of  the chemistry program; 5. the  stimulation of interaction
              between  Elon College and other area institutions through sharing the GC/MS 
              facility.
