Abstract    :
              9452386  Kowles                               Laboratory capabilities in upper
              division biology core courses and  the undergraduate student research program
              have been improved and  diversified by the acquisition of equipment for
              conducting  experiments that require precisely controlled environments.  The
              added instrumentation includes a control chamber, floor model  incubator
              shaker, shaker water bath, thermocycler, DNA sequencing  apparatus, and an
              electroporation system. Laboratory activities  added to the curriculum include:
              bacteria transformation, plasmid  preparation, DNA sequencing, gene
              amplification and transient  expression, and RNase protection in molecular
              biology; studies in  protein synthesis, protein isolation, and cellular
              metabolism in  biochemistry; cellular ATP determination and the dynamics of
              cell  proliferation in cell biology; and a number of qualitative and 
              quantitative techniques for undergraduate research projects.
