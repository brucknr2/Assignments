Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                      The goal of this project is to increase
              the number and quality of  nuclear physics experiments for students at Gustavus
              Adolphus  College. The current apparatus for experimental nuclear physics has 
              some major shortcomings: there is only one computerized multi  channel
              analyzer, there is no equipment for beta spectroscopy or  high-resolution gamma
              spectroscopy, and no equipment for fast  timing experiments. This grant will
              eliminate these problems by  allowing acquisition of an additional multi
              channel analyzer, a  thick surface barrier detector, a HPGe detector, several 
              scintillators, and fast NIM electronics. The addition of this  equipment will
              allow development of many new and innovative  experiments and will
              significantly enhance the nuclear physics  component of our current
              upper-division Experimental Modern Physics  course. It will also be essential
              in the regularized offering of a  Nuclear Physics course.
