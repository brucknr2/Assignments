Abstract    :
              9452685  Kelly    Hampshire College seeks to initiate a summer residential Young
               Scholars program for 60 students during a six week session.  The  program is
              called Hampshire College Summer Studies in  Mathematics.  The faculty of
              college professors, mathematics  majors and graduate students live in the
              program dormitory and  join students for meals and recreational activities as
              well as  for more than 8 hours of mathematics each day.  Small and lively 
              classes and 3 hour evening problem seminars of 15 students guided  by a
              professor and two assistants, will collaboratively  investigate challenging and
              rewarding problems from number  theory, group theory, combinatorics,
              probability, the fourth  dimension, graph theory, infinity, fractals, chaos,
              and other  active branches of mathematics.  Emphasis will be placed on the 
              processes of mathematical thought, discovering patterns,  formulating questions
              and definitions, making conjectures, and  creating proofs, rather than the
              simple accumulation of results.   Activities include classes for four hours
              each morning, evening  problem seminars, daily Prime Time Theorems, visits by
              pure and  applied mathematicians, a weekly program journal, computers, math 
              films, and field trips.  Regular contacts will seek to engage  alums and their
              teachers with serious mathematics and to maintain  the spirit of the Summer
              Studies intellectual community.  ***
