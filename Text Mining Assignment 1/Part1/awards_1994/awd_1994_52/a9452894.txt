Abstract    :
                9452894  Engstrom  The South Dakota EPSCoR Systemic Improvement Plan is
              designed to move the state towards greater  research competitiveness in the
              upcoming three to five year period.  The plan focuses on enhancing  the
              research capability and productivity within South Dakota, building upon
              previous EPSCoR programs  and independent research accomplishments.  Three
              institutions will be involved: the University of South  Dakota, South Dakota
              State University, and the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology.      The
              plan is organized into two fundamental parts, the building of infrastructure
              and scientific research  focus areas.  Infrastructure development will include:
               1) strategies that build a sustained research base  in South Dakota;  2)
              strategies that impact short-term research productivity; and 3) strategies that
               relate to economic development.  The infrastructure activities will be
              implemented within the context  of three interdisciplinary and
              interinstitutional scientific research foci.  The first group, "Surface and 
              Interfacial Science," builds upon developing expertise in structure and
              processes occurring at the  junction of two dissimilar phases.  The second
              project, "The Role of Membranes in Cell Regulation,"   involves scientists from
              various disciplines within the biological sciences.  A third project, "Imaging
              and  Modelling of Coupled Environmental Processes,"  will build upon
              cooperation of the universities with the  EROS Data Center north of Sioux
              Falls.
