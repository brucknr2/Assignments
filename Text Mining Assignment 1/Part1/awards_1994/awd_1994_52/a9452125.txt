Abstract    :
              9452125  VanderWeele                                                   The
              proposed project involves an improvement of laboratory  opportunities for
              courses in psychology at the institution. The  college has a diverse student
              body among whom the sciences,  particularly psychology, are popular majors,
              with about half of  graduates in psychology and psychobiology going on to
              graduate or  professional school. The courses affected by the project include 
              physiological psychology, learning, motivation and emotion,  psychophysiology,
              and experimental psychology. In particular, the  project has allowed the
              development of a student laboratory to  accompany the psychophysiology lecture
              course, and the expansion of  lab exercises in learning, motivation and
              emotion, and  physiological psychology. Equipment primarily includes
              four-channel  polygraphs, micro-computers, video cameras, open field and
              operant  chambers, and stereotaxic instruments.
