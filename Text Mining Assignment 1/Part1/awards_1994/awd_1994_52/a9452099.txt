Abstract    :
              9452099  Boness                                                    We will offer
              our majors in Physics, Chemistry, and in the  engineering disciplines an
              interdisciplinary upper-level laboratory  course that has as foundation an
              active involvement by students in  the confirmation of the atomic theory of
              matter. The bulk of the  course will build on this foundation and will consist
              of student  projects with an atomic force microscope (AFM) and the atomic-scale
               characterization of conducting and non-conducting material surfaces  in air,
              but the students will also experimentally investigate  (Stefan-Boltzmann Law,
              Wien's Displacement Law, and relative  emissivity) black body radiation, the
              birth mother of quantum  physics, and Brownian motion (checking, as did Perrin,
              Einstein's  derivations from his 1905 paper that did so much to silence the 
              critics of the atomic viewpoint, Ernst Mach and Wilhelm Ostwald),  all with
              more historical context provided in lectures, readings,  and critical writing
              assignments than is usual in a lab course. One  thread running through the
              whole course will be an on-going  discussion of what is meant by "seeing"
              atoms, and the nature of  experimental "proof."  This course will provide
              needed on-campus  upper-level laboratory experience with apparatus of
              historical and  pedagogical importance as well as equipment invented even more 
              recently than the scanning tunneling microscope (STM), which was  developed in
              1982 and led to the 1986 Nobel prize. In addition,  Physics major Senior
              Synthesis projects will make extensive use of  the AFM.
