Abstract    :
              9452735  Chopyak-Minor    Keystone School Science will initiate a three-week,
              residential,  Young Scholars Project in Ornithology for 24 students entering 
              grades 11 and 12.  The participants will be involved in activities  in
              environmental science, biology, ecology, and ethology in the  study of resident
              and migratory birds, while fostering a sense of  stewardship toward all bird

              experiences, field trips, and  classroom instruction in ornithology.
