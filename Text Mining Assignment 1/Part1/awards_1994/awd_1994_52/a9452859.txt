Abstract    :
              9452859  Friel                                        Reflecting on our Work:
              NSF Teacher Enhancement    This 2.5-day conference convenes 35 experts in TE
              and school  change to review, critique, and synthesize what has been  learned
              over the past several years of TE projects in K-6  mathematics.  Conferees
              include PIs, former participants of  TE projects, and, to broaden the
              perspective, several  representatives from elementary science.  Issues
              addressed  by the conference include: how best to effect teacher,  school, and
              district change; how such change ultimately  affects students; the resources
              (financial and human)  available to effect systemic change; and assessing the 
              impact of TE programs.  A Proceedings of the conference will  be published and
              will include 5 invited papers identifying  major issues, and a set of
              conference recommendations to  help guide NSF's upcoming massive, national
              teacher  enhancement efforts.
