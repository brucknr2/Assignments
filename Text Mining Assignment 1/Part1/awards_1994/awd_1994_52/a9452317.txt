Abstract    :
              9452317  Ross                                                      An
              interactive computer laboratory will be established for use both  by non
              science majors studying physical science and by physics  majors. As the
              centerpiece of this project, non science majors will  use the computers for
              hands-on manipulation and interpretation of  images obtained from weather
              satellites. Thus, students taking  Introduction to Meteorology, Introduction to
              Geology and  Introduction to Astronomy will gain meaningful scientific 
              experience through the analysis of data presented graphically  rather than
              numerically.  The laboratory will allow nonscience  majors to work directly
              with remote sensing data. High-resolution  images from both geostationary and
              polar orbiting environmental  satellites will be received and stored. These
              will include images  showing visible features, temperature features and water
              vapor  content. The images will be retrievable for study either  individually
              or in "animation loops" which show the changes  occurring over a 24-hour
              period.  The laboratory will also be a  powerful tool for physics majors, who
              will use the computers for  interactive modeling of physical systems and
              graphical analysis of  data obtained in physics laboratories.
