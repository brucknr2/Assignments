Abstract    :
              9452214  Lin                             A few experiments will be developed to
              show students the inside  structure of a laser, to introduce students to some
              fundamental  principles in laser physics, to enhance their understanding of 
              concepts learned from theoretical courses and other labs, and to  stimulate
              their interest in science and engineering.
