Abstract    :
              9452727  Daley    The Memphis State University seeks to initiate a four-week, 
              commuter EAI, Young Scholars program in engineering science for a  group of
              highly promising African American student entering grade  9. The program will
              provide 20 participants with research and  career exploration experiences
              through classroom and laboratory  activities, field trips, and interaction with
              various professionals  in the science and engineering fields. A major goal of
              the program  is to stimulate career interest in engineering science through the
               use of algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and aspects of physics to  examine
              specific laboratory and field problems.
