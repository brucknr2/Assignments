Abstract    :
              9452852  Hudson          ABSTRACT      Twin Cities Public Television proposes to
              develop, test, and distribute a comprehensive multimedia collection and
              learning system which will accompany the Newton's Apple television production.
              The multimedia collection will consist of videodiscs, matching videotape of
              selected Newton's Apple segments, CD ROMs, educator support materials, and
              computer software. The project also will include a component which will train
              educators to integrate the program into local curriculum.  The materials are
              designed  to be a comprehensive learning system that focuses on the acquisition
              of fundamental science concepts and skills which are adaptable to a wide
              variety of instructional situations and the motivation of learners to study
              science. The Newton's Apple Multimedia Collection will be disseminated through
              the National Geographic Society, Inc. and special interest group such as the
              National Urban League, the National Association for Bilingual Education and the
              National Council of La Raza. Summer institutes and short courses will be
              co-sponsored by the Sciene Museum of Minnesota and the National Science
              Teachers Association.
