Abstract    :
              9452320  Bukatko                                             The goal of this
              project is to restructure the teaching and format  of the introductory
              statistics course, a required course of all  majors in psychology. The project
              uses an interactive learning  approach rather than the traditional
              lecture/discussion model. A  principal goal is helping students appreciate more
              the concepts and  assumptions that underlie various statistical tests. 
              Active-learning modules on central statistical concepts incorporate  computer
              graphing and statistical analyses, computer graphing  enable students to
              visualize the theme of each module. The graphing  component is especially
              helpful to those students who have  difficulty understanding mathematical
              formulae. Also, the  computer-based statistical exercises permit students to
              immediately  observe the effects of various transformations and relations among
               various sets of data.
