Abstract    :
              9452229  Hainline  This project involves a novel approach to teaching statistics
              and  survey research methods in psychology and sociology.  Undergraduates,
              particularly majors, utilize a computer-equipped  classroom/laboratory. A more
              intuitive method is used and  interactive graphics better illustrate
              statistical concepts. This  approach helps lessen students' statistics and
              computer anxiety.  The heavily graphical introduction to undergraduate
              statistics also  integrates the use of computer technology and course materials
              to  introduce statistical concepts and a feeling for exploratory data 
              analysis. Existing undergraduate statistics courses are being  modified and
              specific materials and methods are adapted for use in  both fields.
