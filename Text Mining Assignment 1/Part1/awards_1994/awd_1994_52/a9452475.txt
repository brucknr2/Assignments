Abstract    :
              9452475  Poston  This proposal is to enhance the laboratory experience for 
              undergraduate students in Biology and Biochemistry, utilizing the  BioQUEST
              Library of computer simulation/modeling and tools  including text and hypertext
              modules. BioQUEST modules are  structured within a framework that focuses
              science education on  collaborative, open-ended inquiry. The problem-posing, 
              problem-solving, and peer persuasion approach will permit students  in the
              undergraduate Evolution, Ecology and Biochemistry courses to  investigate
              problems, construct experiments and test potential  solutions using simulation
              models. These courses are currently  taught without a laboratory experience or,
              in the case of Ecology,  a limited field/laboratory component. Neither the
              Biology or  Biochemistry department has the computer equipment to integrate the
               BioQUEST Library into the instructional process. Howard University  is the
              leading minority institution in this country and a high  percentage of its
              students are female. Given the projected needs  for much higher minority and
              female workers in scientific and  technical fields, support of this project
              could have a significant  impact in helping to supply the needs of the job
              market in coming  decades, while assisting minority and women students in
              attaining  their careers goals.
