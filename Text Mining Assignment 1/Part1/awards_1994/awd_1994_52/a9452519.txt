Abstract    :
              9452519  Stratton                             As part of an increased emphasis
              on the environment sciences at  Earlham College, funds are requested for
              purchase of equipment to  upgrade our teaching of environmental chemistry. The
              Earlham  Chemistry Department already has an established program in 
              environment chemistry, including courses, laboratory studies, and  student
              research. We now wish to add capabilities for atmospheric  ozone monitoring
              experiments, air sampling experiments, and HPLC  measurement of anions using a
              conductivity detector. We also wish  to add up-to-date methods of sample
              preparation for water, soil and  sludge samples, using microwave digestion and
              solid phase  extraction techniques.
