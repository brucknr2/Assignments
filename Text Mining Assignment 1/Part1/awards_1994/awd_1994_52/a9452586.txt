Abstract    :
              9452586  Shields                                                   The aim of
              this project is to bring high-speed computing and  graphics capabilities to the
              chemistry curriculum at Lake Forest  College. A Silicon Graphics IRIS INDIGO
              workstation has been  acquired for use in Physical Chemistry, Biochemistry and
              student  research projects. In addition, the workstation is being used in 
              Natural Science 100, a new required core course for all entering  students not
              enrolled in a regular natural science course.  In the  physical chemistry
              curriculum, the workstation is networked to  Macintosh computers, so that an
              entire class can perform  quantum-mechanical calculations on the workstation
              while preparing  input and analyzing output on the Macintosh platforms. In the 
              biochemistry curriculum, the workstation is being used to study the  crystal
              structures available from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank,  and for molecular
              dynamics simulations. Student research projects  in computational chemistry and
              X-ray crystallography are greatly  enhanced with the acquisition of the
              workstation. The graphics  capabilities of the workstation are being used in
              the Natural  Science course to illustrate molecular interactions in biochemical
               systems, with particular emphasis on the interactions of enzymes  with
              substrates and DNA-binding proteins with DNA.  A primary goal  of this proposal
              is the development of two laboratory manuals. The  first will contain
              meaningful exercises in quantum chemistry, while  the second will be a graphics
              course centered on enhancing the  understanding of biochemistry.
