Abstract    :
              9452284  McDonald                             This project will provide students
              with important laboratory  instruction in computer-based instrumentation that
              students  appreciate and industry desires. This new instruction will augment 
              traditional instrumentation instruction with challenging and  interesting
              laboratory experiences that use computer-based data  acquisition and instrument
              control. These engaging laboratory  experiences will enhance the students'
              motivation and enthusiasm  while providing them with essential employment
              skills.  These instrumentation experiences will occur throughout the 
              curriculum to build the students' confidence and proficiency with  this
              technology. Students will learn the basics of data acquisition  in technical
              fundamentals courses. This knowledge will then be  reinforced by using data
              acquisition in electrical machinery and  materials testing laboratories.
              Finally, students will use  automated testing in senior-level industrial
              electronics, machine  design, and thermodynamics courses, and also in senior
              design  projects and independent study experiences.  Both associate and
              baccalaureate level students in Automated  Manufacturing, Electrical, and
              Mechanical Engineering Technology  will benefit from this project. Modern
              industry needs these types  of technical graduates who can install, operate,
              and apply  computer-controlled data acquisition and instrumentation systems.
