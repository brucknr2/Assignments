Abstract    :
              Goldman  9452864     Gateways 111 is a conference to be held in San Francisco,
              CA on  October 6-8, 1994 to bring curriculum developers from all of the 
              National Science Foundation funded elementary, middle, and high  school
              comprehensive mathematics curriculum projects.  They share  information,
              experiences, and address common problems that have  arisen as materials have
              been developed, tested, and implemented.   This conference will feature
              increased interaction with teachers  and educators who are involved in
              classroom implementation of  mathematics education reform.  The conference
              schedule include  visits to classrooms, project poster sessions, break-out 
              sessions, and panel discussions.  Implementation will be a major  theme of the
              conference.  ***
