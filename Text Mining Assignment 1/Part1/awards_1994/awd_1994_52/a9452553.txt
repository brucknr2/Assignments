Abstract    :
              9452553  Boda  The major thrust of this work is to integrate a unique, newly 
              implemented two-year Associate Degree Program in Electron  Microscopy and its
              laboratory facility with other instructional  areas within our college. Target
              areas for integration include: (1)  a two-year program in Biotechnology, (2) a
              two-year program in  Welding in particular Metallurgy courses, (3) Chemistry
              courses,  (4) the Biological Sciences, (5) Geology, (6) two-year programs in 
              the Health Professions, and (7) Image Processing. The mechanism of  integration
              will involve: (1) the initiation and expanded use of  elective research credits
              creating joint projects between electron  microscopy students and students from
              other areas, (2) faculty and  students from other disciplines using our
              microscopy laboratory  facility, and (3) the microscopy facility being used for
               demonstrations and instructional presentation by faculty from other 
              instructional areas. In addition, we hope to implement a course for  electron
              microscopy students involving projects supervised by  industry and/or other
              educational institutions.  This goal, if  realized, will allow non-microscopy
              students the rare opportunity  to discover and understand how electron
              microscopy impacts their  areas of major study. The exchange will afford
              microscopy students  a valuable opportunity to experience the broad range of
              microscope  utilization by the many disciplines and academic areas routinely 
              using electron microscopy.    The electron microscopy laboratory facility is
              adequate to meet  this increased student and faculty use except for x-ray 
              microanalysis and image processing capability. Currently only one  scanning
              electron microscope is equipped with both capabilities.  Our plan is to obtain
              an x-ray analyzer capable of image processing  and interfacing it with two
              x-ray detectors (one is already on  hand) installed to two scanning electrons
              microscopes (also on  hand). Thus, two microscopes can have this capability for
              little  more cost than a sin gle microscope installation.  ***
