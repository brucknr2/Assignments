Abstract    :
              9452118  Martinson                                                 A two-course
              undergraduate Biochemistry laboratory sequence   features problem-oriented long
              term projects in place of the  traditional technique-oriented short-term
              exercises. The projects  illustrate major themes in Biochemistry and Molecular
              Biology,  while teaching methodological fundamentals as well as current 
              techniques. The first course focuses on the isolation and  characterization of
              an enzyme. Students learn the fundamental  strategies for macromolecular
              purification, and become acquainted  with the techniques of ammonium sulfate
              fractionation, affinity  chromatography, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis,
              immunoblotting,  gel exclusion chromatography, and several means of protein 
              detection. They also engage in a thorough study of enzyme kinetics.  The second
              course acquaints students with the nature of original  research. Students
              investigate projects dealing with membrane  function and gene regulation, based
              directly on current research  literature in the field.
