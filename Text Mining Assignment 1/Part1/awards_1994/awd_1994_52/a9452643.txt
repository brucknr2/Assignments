Abstract    :
              GER-9452643  University of Vermont  Schall      We ask support for five Graduate
              Research Traineeships in Environmental Biology.  These students will be trained
              by eight faculty in the Zoology Department of the University of Vermont (UVM). 
              This cluster of biologists has been selected as a "center of excellence" in
              science:  Joint state and NSF EPSCoR funding will support continuing research
              by the cluster, and the university has recently added two faculty to the group.
               The EPSCoR funds also provide seed and travel grants for graduate students. 
              Today's doctoral students in environmental biology must combine traditional
              field and theoretical ecology with population genetics, phylogenetic analysis,
              and modern molecular techniques.  Each student will receive training in an
              EPSCoR-funded Molecular Ecology and Evolution Laboratory, and take a series of
              modern laboratory courses in ecological theory, population genetics, and
              phylogenetic analysis.  In addition, five of the eight UVM cluster faculty
              conduct research on ecological and evolutionary parasitology, providing a
              leading center for training students in this field.  Specific plans for
              recruiting women and multicultural students are detailed.  The UVM Zoology
              faculty consists of an unusually high proportion of women who can act as
              mentors for female students; the cluster already has in place agreements with
              several HBCU's locate promising multicultural students.
