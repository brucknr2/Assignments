Abstract    :
              9452704  Watford    Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University seeks to
               initiate a 4 week, residential Young scholars project for 30  students
              entering the 12th grade.  The Manufacturing Engineering  Program for Young
              Scholars will introduce young scientists and  engineers to manufacturing
              systems design and control.  Topics  include Computer-Aided Design,
              Manufacturing Processes/Computer-  Aided Manufacturing, Robotics, Statistics
              and Quality Control and  System Simulation.  Lectures, laboratory exercises and
              trips to  industrial facilities will introduce manufacturing methodologies 
              using hands-on techniques and emphasize the importance of basic  scientific,
              mathematical, and engineering concepts in the  development/operation of
              manufacturing systems, Project  assignments will include both designing and
              prototyping of  manufactured parts and the analysis and control of
              manufacturing  systems.  Completion of the project work will involve the 
              participation in project management tasks and in oral  presentations. 
              Videotaped presentations will be part of the  follow-up component.  ***
