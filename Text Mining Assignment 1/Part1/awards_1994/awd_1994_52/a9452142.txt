Abstract    :
              9452142  Thiel                                                     State of the
              art equipment supports a program which systematically  integrates biotechnology
              into the undergraduate biology curriculum  taken by all biology students,
              including some future teachers.  New  laboratories relevant to biotechnology
              are integrated into a  two-semester introductory biology course and an
              undergraduate  genetics course. These lower-level undergraduate laboratories
              form  the foundation for the students' understanding of the concepts that 
              underlie biotechnology.  Emphasized throughout the courses are: a)  the basic
              concepts that underlie biotechnology, b) hands-on  experience with some of the
              techniques used in biotechnology, and  c) the potential uses and limitations of
              this technology.
