Abstract    :
              9452222  Horner                                                    North Central
              College proposes to incorporate several laser  experiments into its physical
              chemistry laboratory. An introductory  physics laboratory will also be
              affected. Short timescale (50 ns -  10 ms) events heretofore inaccessible in
              the laboratories will be  investigated using chopped or pulsed lasers. In the
              physical  chemistry laboratory a chopped helium-neon laser beam will be used 
              to study the thermal lens effect and measure the heat capacity of  a solvent. A
              pulsed nitrogen laser will function as the excitation  source in two other
              physical chemistry experiments. In one, the  kinetics of a colorful
              photoisomerization reaction will be studied  using the pulse-probe method. In
              another experiment students will  measure luminescence lifetimes to learn about
              factors influencing  radiationless electronic relaxation of excited metal ions,
              with  special emphasis upon collision-induced energy transfer. Chemistry  and
              physics students in an introductory physics laboratory will  receive an early
              exposure to modern optical methods as they use the  pulsed nitrogen laser to
              determine the speed of light. Several  benefits will accrue from this project.
              Topics previously  encountered only in the lecture portion of physical
              chemistry will  be brought to life in the laboratory. The instrumental
              backgrounds  of North Central College chemistry students will be greatly 
              enhanced by their encounters with the modular (rather than "black-  box")
              experimental apparatus, and students will get a taste of  modern experimental
              research methods in physical chemistry.
