Abstract    :
              9452805  Swartz    This proposal seeks funds to conduct a Conference on
              Improving the  Quality of Thinking in a Changing World, to be held at the 
              Massachusetts Institute of Technology July 17 - 22, 1994.  The  primary
              objectives of this Conference are to present the latest  findings on research
              and practice on teaching critical thinking,  problem based learning, and the
              use of advanced technology to  enhance thinking.  The general format is to
              present topical  information in modules with complementary working sessions. 
              These  working sessions are to be directed toward the establishment of 
              priorities for further research and for the development of relevant  and
              effective models of instruction which will foster the critical  thinking and
              problem solving skills.  Teachers are to be major  participants in the
              conference and post conference activities.
