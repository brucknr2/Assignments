Abstract    :
              9452137  Towsley                              SUNY at Geneseo is a liberal-arts
              college with a significant  portion of its student population enrolled in
              majors in  Mathematics, Computer Science, and the various Natural Sciences. 
              Calculus I is a required course in most of these programs and  highly
              recommended in the others.  To improve the effectiveness of  Calculus I (and
              eventually Calculus II and III) a computer  laboratory session of two hours per
              week is being added.  The  lecture session is being decreased from four hours
              per week to  three.  The goals of the laboratory component are 1) to enable the
               student to explore a wider variety of mathematical situations than  are
              available to hand calculation, 2) to develop understanding of  the concepts of
              the calculus through writing and exploration, 3) to  present applications of
              Calculus which are too detailed for lecture  presentation, and 4) to enable the
              students to use mathematical  software such as Mathcad.  To equip this
              laboratory this project  supports the acquisition of 30 computers, networking
              materials, and  software.  Approximately 1100 students per year use the
              laboratory.
