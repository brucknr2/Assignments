Abstract    :
              9452403  Murray  Powerbooks and desktop computer workstations are used for 
              field  and laboratory studies in ecology. This project is also part of a 
              departmental effort to improve science learning experiences for our 
              ethnically-diverse undergraduates and provides more opportunities  for
              projects, discussion, cooperative learning, and oral and  written communication
              work. Another goal is to insure that our  students gain skills in collecting,
              analyzing, and interpreting  data and presenting their results by using modern
              computing  instrumentation and application software. Powerbooks are used to 
              collect and analyze data in the lab and at several remote field  sites in
              support of 1) a weekly lab being added to a required  majors ecology course,
              and 2) selected elective courses in our  ecology and organismic biology
              program. The Powerbooks are equipped  with modems and Ethernet connections to
              allow remote and lab access  to a custom File Server, the campus mainframe, and
              other electronic  resources.
