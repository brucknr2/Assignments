Abstract    :
              9452682  Kent              The Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory (MDIBL)
              will initiate  an eight week, commuter and residential, Young Scholars Program
              in  marine science for 16 students entering grades 11 and 12. The core  of the
              program is the one-to-one research laboratory experience  each student will
              have with a highly trained scientist mentor. The  students will have a one week
              training session prior to working in  the laboratory. After this training, the
              students will have a  weekly schedule which will include scientific seminars,
              field  trips, career awareness activities, lectures in molecular biology 
              geared for their level, and peer discussions of individual research  projects.
