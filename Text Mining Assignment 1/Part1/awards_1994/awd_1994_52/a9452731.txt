Abstract    :
              9452731  Ripley      The Montana College of Mineral Science and Technology
              (MONTANA  TECH) will initiate a 4-week, summer residential, Young Scholars 
              Project in earth science for 24 students entering grades 9, 10, and  11. The
              Mineral Education Program for Young Scholars (MEPYS)  immerses rural students
              from Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, North Dakota,  Utah and Washington in the field
              and laboratory activities of  hydro-geology and the associated areas of
              geological, mining,  metallurgical, mineral processing, petroleum, and
              environmental  engineering. The program provides students with first-hand
              research  experience in mineral education under the direction of practicing 
              scientists and engineers who have chosen these career areas.
