Abstract    :
              9452824  Rosa    The University of Denver seeks to intimate a 3-week, summer 
              residential and commuter Young Scholars project in engineering for  58 students
              entering grades 10, 11 and 12. This national program is  particularly
              interested in the recruitment of women, African  Americans, Hispanics, and
              American Indians students. The program  includes instructional and research
              activities in all engineering  disciplines but emphasizes electrical and
              mechanical engineering.  Students are provided opportunities to discuss
              engineering careers  and professional ethics; visit with engineers in industry,
              private  practice, university research and government; use the computer as 
              engineering tool; and do individual and team engineering analysis  and design.
