Abstract    :
              9452489  Mansfield  A computer laboratory for instruction in advanced
              mathematics is  being developed to be used for classroom instruction, homework 
              assignments, individually assigned projects, and supervised  independent study.
              The laboratory runs on  Mathematica on Macintosh  computers and is equipped
              with an overhead LED projection system.  Students working in the lab experiment
              and discover mathematics for  themselves. Courses are being redesigned to
              promote this  experimental side of mathematics.
