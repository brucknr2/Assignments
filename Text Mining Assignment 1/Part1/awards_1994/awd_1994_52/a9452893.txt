Abstract    :
              9452893  Gomez  The Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research
              (EPSCoR)  in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico will enhance the research 
              competitiveness of approximately 50 university faculty working in  three
              research thrust areas.  The selected research areas are:  (1)  Biotechnology;
              (2) Materials Science; and (3) Science and  Engineering Infrastructure.  Each
              of the research areas hate  identified short, intermediate, and long range
              goals (up to the  year 2000) and devised strategies to:  achieve national and 
              international levels of excellence; strengthen human resources in  science and
              technology; create advisory councils of distinguished  researchers to guide
              project development; establish collaborative  agreement with national and
              international groups and laboratories;  and vigorously seek additional funds to
              build on the base provided  by EPSCoR.  Collaborative agreements have been made
              with the  Industry/University/Research Center, the Corporation for the 
              Technological Development of Tropical Resources, and the Puerto  Rico
              Scientific Community Council to promote and advocate for the  strengthening of
              the Commonwealth's science and engineering  community and the development of
              R&D in the private and government  sectors.
