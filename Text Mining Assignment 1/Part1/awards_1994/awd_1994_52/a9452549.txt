Abstract    :
              9452549  McGinnis                                                  A
              computer-based neurophysiology laboratory will complement an  existing
              neurobiology course within the Biology Department. The  laboratory component
              will foster increased exploration, critical  analysis and hands-on experience
              in using state-of-the art  instrumentation by students enrolled in the course.
              Equipment will  be purchased to build five (5) electrophysiological
              workstations  including: electrophysiological instrumentation, computers, and 
              optical equipment. Emphasis will be placed on the use of  instrumentation, as
              well as graphical and statistical analysis of  data using computers and
              computer software. As a result of this  experience, students will learn
              concepts of neurobiology through  inquiry and experimentation. The students
              will also become familiar  with a computer and its application as a tool to
              gather and analyze  data, skills that are increasingly becoming a requisite for
              both  technical and non-technical careers. Approximately 40 students  annually
              will be able to increase their skills through enrollment  in the proposed
              computer-based neurophysiolocal laboratory.
