Abstract    :
              9452376  Ahern-Rindell  Newly acquired equipment enables introduction of an
              extensive  laboratory component into a recently initiated upper division 
              course in molecular genetics.  The course fits into an already  established
              commitment to a molecular biology program of study  across the campus. The
              course is designed around a critical  thinking approach that utilizes
              cooperative group learning  techniques.  The extensive laboratory component
              stresses student  cooperation in solving problems through creative, group
              designed  experiments. The course impacts zoology majors as well as students 
              in the criminal justice, biotechnician, and wildlife conservation  programs. 
              It provides the basis for developing individualized  undergraduate research
              projects, most significantly through the  thesis program in the Department of
              Zoology.
