Abstract    :
              9452128  Miyamoto                                                  A digital
              scanning electron microscope (SEM), with energy  dispersive x-ray spectrometer
              (EDS) and equipped to do image  acquisition, enhancement and analysis, will be
              linked to an  existing academic local area network (LAN). With this system we 
              will engage our students in the use of an up-to-date instrument  that uses
              digital technology to acquire and analyze images. We will  develop a
              pedagogical sequence that develops student abilities in  handling a complex
              instrument system in a step-wise fashion.  Beginning with an introduction to
              the concepts of electron  microscopy and imaging in a first year foundational
              biology module,  we progress to applying this instrumentation to compare
              different  kinds of cultured cells in a second year biology module. Upper 
              level biology and chemistry classes complete the sequence by  providing
              students the opportunity to learn and extensively use a  number of advanced
              applications in different settings. In this  fashion we give our students a
              gateway exposure to imaging  applications that have become pivotal for research
              and analysis in  biology, chemistry, and medicine.
