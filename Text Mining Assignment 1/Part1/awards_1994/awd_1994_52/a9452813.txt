Abstract    :
              HRD - 9452813  PI:  Dr. Eugene DeLoatch  Morgan State University  Baltimore,
              Maryland    Diversity in the Scientific and Technological Workforce  (An NSF
              National Conference)    Morgan State University proposes to again collaborate
              with NSF in  the implementation of the student component of the NSF third 
              National Conference on Diversity in the Scientific and  Technological
              Workforce, which is scheduled in Washington, DC on  September 29 - October 1,
              1994.  The conference will focus  attention on the Foundation's role in the
              education of minorities  who are underrepresented in science, mathematics,
              engineering and  technology (SMET) fields.  Conference activities will include 
              research presentations by more than 300 student participants in  NSF-sponsored
              research projects, and the presentation and  discussion of the NSF Action Plan
              that outlines a national strategy  to assure a significant expansion of the
              nation's scientific and  technological workforce to include underrepresented
              minorities in  a variety of roles.  The university would prepare abstracts of 
              student presentations, and design and schedule activities to  encourage student
              interactions with role models and other minority  SMET students, leading to the
              formation of support group to  reinforce student selection of SMET majors and
              careers.  Grant  activities also would include working with EHR in scheduling 
              student travel and hotel accommodations, and arranging  transportation to the
              conference for local area precollege and  college students.
