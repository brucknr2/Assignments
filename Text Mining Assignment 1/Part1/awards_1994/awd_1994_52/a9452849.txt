Abstract    :
              9452849  Zuman    This project develops the Sunflower Science Discovery Magazine
               for Children.  This is a fully bilingual English\Spanish  publication designed
              to encourage Latino students to develop  language skills as well as turn their
              interest to the world of  scientific discovery.  The magazine is geared towards
              students in  grades 3-6, and presents science information and experiments in 
              stimulating graphic formats and poses interesting and relevant  questions for
              children based on current scientific developments.   In an effort to provide
              positive role models for children of  Hispanic descent, the magazine highlights
              historical and  contemporary contributions and accomplishments of Latino 
              scientists.  The magazine also strives to foster a multicultural  perspective
              by presenting science and technology issues faced by  selected communities in
              various stages of economic development to  Latino children in an attempt to
              strengthen their identification  with their national origin and ethnic
              heritage.  Initially, two  issues are being produced with plans to produce
              fourteen issues  over a four year period.  The ultimate goal is for the 
              publication to become self-sustaining after the development  period.   ***
