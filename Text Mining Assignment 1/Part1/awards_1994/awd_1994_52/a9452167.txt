Abstract    :
              9452167  Wolf  An instrumented laboratory is being developed for teaching 
              geophysical field methodologies that are used in environmental  investigations
              to undergraduate students.  The students benefitting  the most are those with
              majors in geology, geological engineering,  earth sciences, and environmental
              sciences who are enrolled in the  Auburn University Department of Geology's
              classes in applied  geophysics and field methods, the Department of Civil
              Engineering's  classes in subsurface hydrology and measurements, and
              laboratories  associated with these and other classes within Geology and 
              Engineering.  The equipment is being used in a variety of local  settings to
              demonstrate techniques of data acquisition and  experiment design that are
              useful in environmental assessments.   Four pieces of geophysical equipment,
              all used in environmental  analyses, are being integrated into the curriculum: 
              1) a  24-channel Digital Instantaneous Floating Point (DIFP) Signal  Stacking
              Seismograph; 2) a DC Resistivity unit; 3) a Proton  Magnetometer, and 4) an
              Electromagnetic Ground Conductivity Meter  (EM-3 1).  The equipment directly
              enriches the undergraduate  applied geophysics class and, at the same time,
              contributes to  three interdisciplinary undergraduate programs by giving
              students  in these majors first-hand experience in characterizing 
              environmental conditions with geophysical tools.  A review of  current
              institutional programs shows a lack, nationally, of  educational laboratory
              experiences in geophysics as applied to  environmental investigations, despite
              changes in career  opportunities for graduates of earth science programs.
              Auburn is  addressing this deficiency by training students for environmental 
              careers and preparing them to lead research in new approaches for  the future.
