Abstract    :
              The use of Georgraphic Information Systems (GIS) is expanding  rapidly
              throughout the world, creating an extraordinary demand  for professionals well
              versed in that technology. The aim of this  project is to develop and institute
              a new and innovative method for  introducing GIS to undergraduate engineering
              and non- engineering  students. Being developed are a series of GIS laboratory
              exercises  which  maintain a balance between software training, and the 
              conceptual and intellectual basis for GIS. The laboratory exercises  are being
              produced in a multimedia format and are available in a CD  ROM or compact
              diskette medium.  The programming strategy used   yields a student centered,
              non-linear approach to learning and  mastering GIS concepts and usage. The
              courseware developed can also  be used for the initial training of other
              faculty, and to  disseminate project results. While the major impact of this
              project  involves the civil engineering curriculum, there is keen interest  and
              support for a new GIS laboratory and it's attendant innovative  method of
              instruction shown by  the College of Arts and Sciences,  and the College of
              Education.
