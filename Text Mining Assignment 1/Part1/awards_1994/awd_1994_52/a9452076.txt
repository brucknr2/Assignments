Abstract    :
              9452076  Mink  The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a 200 MHz Fourier 
              Transform NMR spectrometer with a 1H-13C probe and a variable  temperature
              controller. The instrument is an integral part of the  ongoing updating of the
              curriculum to emphasize chemical structure,  synthesis and dynamics in the
              laboratory courses. The project  incorporates "hands-on" use of the FT-NMR
              spectrometer across the  curriculum, including 1-D and 2-D analysis in the
              organic,  inorganic and biochemistry courses. Two new laboratory courses are 
              also undergoing development, "Practical NMR Spectroscopy" and  "Advanced
              Synthesis." "Practical NMR Spectroscopy" includes the  theory of FT-NMR
              spectroscopy, and experiments using multiple-pulse  sequencing, selective
              decoupling, and 2-D spectroscopy. "Advanced  Synthesis" is a project-based,
              research-oriented course emphasizing  the synthesis of organic and inorganic
              compounds combined with  techniques of 1-D and 2-D FT-NMR spectroscopy for
              product  elucidation and mechanistic studies.  The instrument is also being 
              used by students in our non-majors organic chemistry courses, and  by local
              high school teachers and community college students.  The  instrument is also
              enhancing an active undergraduate research  program.
