Abstract    :
              9452346  Snow  It is proposed to acquire a Microcal MSC-ITC/DSC Solution 
              Calorimeter System in order to enhance our capabilities to (i)  teach solution
              thermodynamics to the undergraduate students in our  physical chemistry and
              biochemistry laboratories, and (ii) perform  undergraduate research projects
              requiring the use of solution  calorimetry. Two experiments using the solution
              differential  scanning calorimeter(DSC) and the isothermal titration
              calorimeter  (ITC) are to be developed for each laboratory. For the physical 
              chemistry laboratory, it is proposed that the solution DSC be used  to measure
              the thermodynamic properties of a drug-biological  membrane interaction, while
              the titration calorimeter be used to  determine the partition coefficient for
              the partioning of a drug in  a biological membrane. For the biochemistry
              laboratory, it is  proposed that the solution DSC be used to study the effects
              of  saturated and cis unsaturated phospholipid systems on the physical 
              properties of biological membranes, while the titration calorimeter  be used to
              study the effects of binding of an enzyme to a substrate  analogue. The use of
              these instruments will expose our students to  this important area of
              physical-biochemistry, something we are  unable to do effectively with our
              present equipment.
