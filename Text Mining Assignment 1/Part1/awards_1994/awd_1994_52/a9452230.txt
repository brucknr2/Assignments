Abstract    :
              9452230  Swartz  Grinnell College will purchase a Hewlett Packard MS-Engine to 
              incorporate mass spectroscopy, including electron impact and  chemical
              ionization techniques, into Introductory Chemistry,  Organic Chemistry,
              Advanced Organic Chemistry, Instrumental  Analysis, and Physical Chemistry
              courses and for student/faculty  research. Mass spectrometers are now easy to
              use and accessible to  relatively inexperienced undergraduates, but they have
              not been  incorporated into the curriculum in a substantial way, except as  gas
              chromatographic detectors. Experiments will be developed which  illustrate a
              range of standard sample introduction and ionization  techniques. Use of the
              spectrometer will begin in the introductory  courses and be integrated through
              the entire curriculum. We  estimate that 120 undergraduate students (10% of the
              College's  enrollment) will use the instrument each year.
