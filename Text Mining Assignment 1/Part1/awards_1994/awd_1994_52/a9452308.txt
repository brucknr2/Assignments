Abstract    :
              9452308  Williams                                                  A computer
              interfaced isothermal titration calorimeter is used as  part of the laboratory
              in introductory biochemistry to improve the  student understanding of
              thermodynamic principles in biological  molecules.  The calorimeter is also
              used to train biochemistry  students in modern biochemical research; mainly  
              advanced study of the interactions between biological  macromolecules.
