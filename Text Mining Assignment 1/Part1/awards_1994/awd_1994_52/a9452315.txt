Abstract    :
              9452315  Peterson  This project is to equip the University of Connecticut's 
              observatories with a CCD camera and data processing system to bring  them to a
              state-of-the art facility. Ancillary apparatus has been  acquired for on site
              image acquisition, preliminary data  processing, subsequent data reduction,
              storage, printing. Several  experiments are being developed for advanced
              students, as well as  CCD cluster investigations for the beginning level. In
              addition to  serving as basic training for future astronomers, the laboratory 
              also serves the large number of introductory students interested in  astronomy
              and their peers who are physics majors. A second major  item is a Proxima Desk
              Top Projector which facilitates planetarium  discussions of solar system
              configurations and planetary motions  that were not possible before with the
              simple Spitz planetarium.   It is also used in demonstrations in the lecture
              hall and for  travelling presentations in libraries and schools. Both major
              items  have the additional attraction that they are making astronomy at  the
              University of Connecticut accessible to handicapped students  for whom the
              planetarium and observatories were previously  user-unfriendly and
              inaccessible, respectively.
