Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    9452785  Barstow    This project is to understand the potential for
              implementing instructional materials using Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
              to change the way students and teachers in grades 6-12 engage in scientific
              investigations.  The basic concepts of GIS are introduced in the context of
              mapping the local environment around the school. The knowledge learned is
              extended and applied in two additional units which explore an area of science
              or technology of local interest such as pipes and wires or a plant survey.  The
              students are not only doing data analysis, but exploring their environment,
              collecting their own observations, and using the power of technology to make
              connections among the natural and built environments of their locality.  The
              materials emphasize development of thinking skills, problem-solving, data
              analysis, and visualization.  Students should learn how one element of the city
              affects the others and develop a sense of personal connection to the city.  As
              the activities focus on urban resources the "economically disadvantaged"
              students become "scientifically advantaged" learners since cities are generally
              rich in GIS resources.  Major corporations and government agencies in the
              Boston area have agreed to collaborate.  A resource guide for GIS urban
              education which includes the introductory material, software guidelines,
              suggestions for data sources, and other recommendations is to be developed and
              distributed nationally.  The project is well-documented and the materials are
              tested in a locality outside of Boston.
