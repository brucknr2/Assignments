              Arlington, MA  02174        Special Project/TP    Title:  Responding to the
              Call for Change:  Characterizing the Mathematics Preparation of Elementary
              School Teachers    This project is a one year national effort having as its
              goal to examine the content of the college/university mathematics experiences
              (viz., course offerings, content emphases, and alignment with the spirit of
              current reform efforts) of prospective elementary teachers.  The plan has three
              objectives:  1.  Conduct a survey of colleges and universities to gather
              up-to-date information about current practices in teacher preparation programs.
               (This objective has already been achieved through funding from NSF and Exxon
              Foundation - see Appendix B.)  2.  Identify and collect materials (textbooks,
              materials developed by funded projects, and locally-developed materials) that
              are currently being used by colleges and universities around the United States.
               3.  Characterize the materials collected with respect to attributes such as: 
              (1) the unifying themes ("big mathematical ideas") for the materials, (2) the
              organization, sequencing, and presentation of mathematics content, (3) the
              primary pedagogical features of the materials (e.g., instructional approaches
              recommended by the authors, grouping schemes promoted, and types of assessment
              techniques used), (4) the use made of technology, including computer software
              and manipulatives, and (5) the degree of the alignment of the materials with
              recently developed (or presently under development) materials by the various
              elementary and middle grades curriculum development projects sponsored by NSF. 
              The project will involve collaboration among three primary sites:  COMAP,
              Indiana University, and the University of Chicago
