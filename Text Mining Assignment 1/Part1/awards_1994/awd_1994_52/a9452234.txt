Abstract    :
              9452234  Yanik  A student computing laboratory is being established, making 
              possible innovations which principally fall into three areas:  collaborative
              learning, the use of journals, and technology. The  use of journals will be
              expanded by the establishment of a computer  "bulletin board" for the posting
              of questions and comments among  the students and between students and
              instructors. Because the  preparation of mathematics teachers is a primary
              mission of the  division a primary focus is integrating technology as an
              important  tool in teaching mathematics.
