Abstract    :
              9452145  Harmon                               The Department of Physics at ISU
              will renovate of its introductory  physics laboratories to improve quality and
              cost effectiveness and  to increase the technologic relevance of the program. 
              The  professional working environment calls for familiarity in the use  of
              computers to acquire and manipulate data.  Undergraduate  laboratories can
              provide an excellent introduction to data  manulipation techniques with
              computers due to the relative  simplicity of the subject material.  Recent
              developments in  inexpensive analog and digital computer interfacing equipment
              allow  more flexibility in data collection and analysis and increase the  scope
              and variety of experiments available for use in introductory  laboratories.  To
              take advantage of this, the Department of Physics  at ISU will establish a
              computer laboratory that will be the first  in the USA to utilize the new
              Intellecta Laboratory Interface and  software.  This extremely sophisticated
              system is based around  EXCEL for WINDOWS and allows the user to easily use the
              full power  of the WINDOWS environment to design a laboratory or instructional 
              environment.  The hardware interface consists of a number of A/D  and D/A
              converters, counters, timers, etc. that acquire data in and  control processes
              from the WINDOWS environment.  This allows access  to OLE (object linking and
              embedding), DDE (dynamic data exchange),  access to the protected mode of the
              486 chip, availability of  memory above one megabyte, etc. and thus makes the
              most efficient  use of the power of WINDOWS platforms of the type requested.
