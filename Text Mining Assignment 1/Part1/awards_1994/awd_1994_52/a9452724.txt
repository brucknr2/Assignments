Abstract    :
              9452724  Llamas  A four-state consortium will provide a framework for a 
              regional self-study of the educational and economic barriers  to systemic
              reform, for a highly impoverished,  geographically isolated, and culturally
              diverse region with  a high minority population.  The consortium will organize,
               liason, and provide direction and technical assistance to  nine coalitions
              which represent the geographic and tribal  areas.  During the Development
              period, each coalition will  work with its respective community to determine
              needs and  strategies to be implemented within the framework of RSI,  and the
              consortium will integrate the needs of the areas  into an overall plan for the
              region.
