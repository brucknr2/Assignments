Abstract    :
              9452558  Faulk  The purpose of this proposal is to obtain funding for the 
              establishment of a Production Planning and Control Laboratory. The 
              laboratory's principal purpose will be to provide support for a  three
              semester-hour, senior level university course of the same  name. Many
              universities, community colleges, and technical  institutes have such a course
              but without a laboratory component.  The authors of this proposal intend are
              convinced that production  planning and control must be practiced in a
              laboratory as well as  taught on a lecture basis. A secondary purpose is to
              obtain  equipment to be used as the basis for further instruction in the 
              subject of computer-controlled machining.
