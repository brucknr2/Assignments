Abstract    :
              9452550  Mulroy  Quantitative reasoning, scientific communication skills, and 
              comprehension of biological concepts are being enhanced by  integrating the use
              of computers in classrooms, laboratories, and  field studies.  The computers
              are incorporated in introductory and  advanced biology courses, and are used by
              undergraduates in all  phases of independent research projects. Students also
              learn  statistical concepts, data analysis, and scientific communication  in a
              biological context. As a result of this project, we expect to  graduate
              students with greater competence in contemporary  technology and in modes of
              thinking central to scientific inquiry,  including abstract, critical, and
              quantitative reasoning.
