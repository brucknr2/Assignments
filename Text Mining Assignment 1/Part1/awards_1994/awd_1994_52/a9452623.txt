Abstract    :
              9452623  Walters                              The project involves the
              establishment of a vibrations and  acoustics laboratory that will not only
              support the curricula of  the department of mechanical engineering and the
              department of  manufacturing engineering, but will also aid in the development
              of  lab exercises which integrate fundamental mathematical concepts  into the
              labs and which build in complexity until a capstone lab  which requires the
              students to instrument, acquire and analyze a  real problem in industry.  An
              innovative feature of the laboratory development effort its  incorporation 
              with the newly legislated Rio Grand Valley Center  for Manufacturing located at
              the University.  The Center will  provide the oportunity for students to access
              local manufacturers  in support of laboratory exercises.  Manufacturers will
              also be  able to request that student senior design projects use the 
              facilities of the laboratory to address the manufacturers  engineering needs. 
              The faculty is committed to instruction which is based in  laboratory and
              industrial experience. With approximately 500  manufacturers in the Rio Grande
              Valley, there are a virtually  endless number of student projects available. 
              This project will equip the students and faculty with industrial  grade as well
              as educational grade equipment. Thus, basic concepts  can be demonstrated and
              experienced on the educational grade  equipment and the student can progress to
              the exact equipment which  is considered to be an industrial standard.
