Abstract    :
              9452336  Hopkins  Laboratory experiences in molecular and cellular biology are 
              enhanced by the introduction of new experiments and by making  existing
              experiments available to larger numbers of students. These  experiences benefit
              biology and chemistry majors as well as science  education and nursing
              students.  Opportunities are created for  students to gain practical experience
              in techniques used in  research, diagnostics, and genetic testing.  Students 
              undertake  the large-scale production, isolation, and purification of DNA and 
              proteins from microorganisms and eukaryotic cells by using a  fermentor,
              high-speed centrifuge, and homogenizer, and they  characterize these molecules
              by polyacrylamide and agarose gel  electrophoresis. The students also explore
              technologies of  molecular probing by fluorescence microscopy and Southern and 
              Western blotting with nonradioactive probes.
