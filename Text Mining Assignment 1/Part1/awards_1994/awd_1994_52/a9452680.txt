Abstract    :
              9452680  Stevens    Boston University seeks to initiate a Young Scholars
              program,  called Program in Mathematics for Young Scientists, PROMYS, 
              consisting of an intensive six week residential summer program  for an
              ambitious group of 60 students who have completed grades 9  through 11.  PROMYS
              serves 45 first year students and 15  returning students.  Students are advised
              by 18 mathematically  experienced college-aged counselors and 10 faculty
              members.    The heart of the program is the experience gained by students 
              through their individual and collective efforts to solve an  assortment of
              challenging problems in Number Theory.  In 1995,  students will also study
              Abstract Algebra, Geometric Topology,  and Combinatorics.  Diverse weekly guest
              lecturers introduce  participants to related scientific fields, philosophical
              and  ethical questions and career options in mathematics and science.   
              Follow-up activities include an Open-Door Problem Set, Suggested  Reading List,
              student presentations in their own schools, and the  PROMYS newsletter.  ***
