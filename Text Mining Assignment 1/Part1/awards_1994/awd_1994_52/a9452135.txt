Abstract    :
              9452135  Craig                                Hobart and William Smith Colleges
              will establish a computer  laboratory for high performance molecular modeling.
              A network  information retrieval system has been designed by the project 
              director that gives convenient campus-wide interactive graphic  access to data
              in the Brookhaven National Laboratory Protein Data  Bank. This laboratory will
              facilitate the integration of molecular  modeling of complex bimolecular into
              course work and research in  undergraduate chemistry, interdisciplinary
              studies, and biology.  The impetus for this project comes from a desire to make
              the  learning of bimolecular structure a more active discovery-oriented 
              process for students as well as to expand the modes through which  our students
              and faculty access the chemical literature. In course  work, students can now
              be asked to find structural evidence that  supports their claims about
              biological function, underlying  chemical principles that determine structure,
              mechanisms for enzyme  catalysis, and much more.
