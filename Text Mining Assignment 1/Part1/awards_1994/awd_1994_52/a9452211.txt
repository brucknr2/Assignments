Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to establish at Michigan  Technological
              University a model computer laboratory with  appropriate software for the
              learning and teaching of geometry  through inductive approaches. The laboratory
              will consist of eleven  Macintosh Quadra 650 computers networked together.
              Software  packages such as the Geometry Inventer, the Geometric  superSupposer,
              Geometer's Sketchpad, Terrapin LOGO, and the Factory  will be utilized in the
              learning and teaching of College Geometry  to preservice secondary school
              mathematics teachers. With this  software, students can create their own
              geometric constructions,  look for patterns, formulate conjectures, and test
              these  conjectures rather quickly.    The software packages will be explored
              for geometry ideas and  concepts which lend themselves to inductive learning
              via the  software. A plan for the use of the software on those topics will  be
              developed by the instructor, and summarized for the students in  a software
              guide. The software guide will serve as a supplement to  their text and as a
              directory to when and how they should use the  software packages. Student
              attitudes toward learning geometry in  this manner and the amount of material
              covered will be evaluated.
