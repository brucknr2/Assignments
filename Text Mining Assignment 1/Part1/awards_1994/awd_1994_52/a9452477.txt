Abstract    :
              9452477  Olson  A laboratory improvement program has been proposed to integrate
              and  modernize the laboratory components of three environmental  engineering
              courses: "Environmental Chemistry for Environmental  Engineering",
              "Physical-Chemical Processes", and "Microbial  Processes". The project will
              involve the development of three new  pairs of laboratory exercises that will
              help to reinforce key  topics between the classes. In addition, the new
              exercises will  illustrate the fundamental relationships between chemical and 
              microbial systems, provide the opportunity to analyze more  realistic complex
              samples, and expose engineering students to  modern instruments in gas
              chromatography and spectrophotometry that  they currently do not have access
              to. Among the equipment items  requested, the two major instruments include a
              gas chromatograph  and a scanning spectrophotometer. A few additional equipment
              pieces  that support the new types of proposed exercises are also  requested.
              By the fall of 1994, the program will acquire new  dedicated wet-laboratory
              space for undergraduate environmental  engineering instruction. This laboratory
              will be used primarily by  undergraduate majors in Environmental Engineering, a
              brand new  baccalaureate program, and by Civil Engineering majors who 
              specialize in environmental engineering. The current enrollments in  each of
              the three classes are in the range of 35 to 55. While some  State of California
              funds are available to equip this new  laboratory, the amount available falls
              short of what is needed to  significantly modernize the facilities. The
              requested equipment  will greatly improve our ability, therefore, to provide an
               exceptional laboratory experience for this new degree program.
