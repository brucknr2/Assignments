Abstract    :
              9452012  Sharp  With funds provided by the NSF ILI-IG and local match, Delta 
              College will purchase a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer  (GC/MS). The
              addition of the GC/MS will enhance the FTIR, NMR, and  high performance HPLC as
              the four major instruments in Delta  College's Chemistry Department. This
              equipment will improve the  learning opportunities for science students
              enrolled in the core  chemistry courses (general, inorganic, organic, and
              Chemical  Analysis/Instrumentation) as well as those in other specialized 
              chemistry based curricula such as Chemical Technology and  Environmental
              Science. Laboratory experiences developed using the  GC/MS are a critical
              component for the analytical techniques  required of students in the newly
              established Water/Waste Water  Treatment curriculum. The GC/MS will be
              available to area  researchers and small businesses to conduct sample analyses
              and  research projects that incorporate Delta College students.
