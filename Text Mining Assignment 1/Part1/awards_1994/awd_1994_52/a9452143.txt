Abstract    :
              9452143  Mehta  This project focuses on two core areas common to all engineering
               laboratories, instrumentation and communication. Resource modules  containing
              generic information on the above two areas will be  developed using hypermedia
              and other computer technologies. These  modules will be further used in the
              development of two laboratory  modules to provide one-on-one instruction, the
              latest technological  advances, and industrial applications related to the
              experiment.  A pilot study was conducted in the summer and fall 1993 to test
              the  above concept. The results of the study showed that student  comprehension
              of the experimental set-up and its operation had  increased and the written
              reports were of consistently high  quality. The pilot study also generated
              requests from other  department for using the report writing module in their 
              laboratories. The full scale project will directly affect three  required
              courses in the mechanical engineering department and  benefit 23O undergraduate
              students every year.  The resource  modules on instrumentation and
              communication, which will be put on  a CD-ROM, can be used as a handbook
              without any further development  effort or they can be used in developing
              individualized laboratory  modules with minimal effort. Faculty from four
              universities will be  using and evaluating these resource modules.  The
              proposed project  will provide undergraduate students with more relevant and
              current  information, improve their understanding, increase their interest  and
              curiosity, and improve their communication skills without  increasing the
              length of the curriculum.
