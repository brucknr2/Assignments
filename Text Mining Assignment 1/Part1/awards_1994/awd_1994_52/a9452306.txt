Abstract    :
              9452306  Wistrand                                                  The proposal
              is for equipment and software to upgrade laboratories  in the Molecular
              Genetics course (Biology 316) to incorporate  recent advances in molecular
              genetics, especially in the area of  DNA analysis. What were once highly
              specialized procedures in  molecular biology have become standard; the
              polymerase chain  reaction (PCR) is utilized as often as electrophoresis and
              has  substituted in many cases for the CsCl DNA extraction technique for 
              preparation of small amounts of DNA. This project requests funding  to: 1) add
              the PCR protocols to the laboratory by acquiring a  thermal cycler; and 2) add
              computer hardware and software to design  PCR primers, to allow for entry of
              DNA sequences directly into the  computer with the current sequencing gel
              reader, and analyze and  compare sequences with those in databases such as
              GenBank. These  additions to the laboratory will allow women science students
              to  have direct experience with techniques that are becoming standard  in
              research laboratories, graduate school, and medicine.
