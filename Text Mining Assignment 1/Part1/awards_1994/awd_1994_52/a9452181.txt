Abstract    :
              9452181  Rudnick-Kaun                         This project will provide an
              integrated systems approach to the  laboratory environment of the Pulp and
              Paper Chemical Technology  associate degree program with additional benefits to
              students in  the Natural Resources Technology program. This project responds to
               the local paper industry needs for trained graduates to work in  integrated
              and automated manufacturing and research operations  performing product
              analysis and process control using computerized  data systems. The requested
              equipment is geared toward the rising  industry standards for using increasing
              amounts of recycled fiber  in the paper making process. Current manual
              equipment in the  laboratories limits the curriculum to experimenting with
              fragments  of the systems process. This project elevates the competency level 
              of the curriculum by creating the potential for a new range of  Laboratory
              experimentation. This curriculum will be shared with  other college and
              university pulp and paper science programs  challenged with educating students
              for employment in this dynamic  industry.
