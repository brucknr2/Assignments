Abstract    :
              9452260  Loffredo                             The FT-NMR requested in this
              proposal will be used to strengthen  laboratory instruction in organic
              chemistry, physical biochemistry,  physical chemistry, instrumental analysis,
              inorganic chemistry and  research. This will be accomplished by enhancement of
              existing  experiments currently in use in courses utilizing NMR, introduction 
              of new experiments into courses currently providing NMR  instruction, and
              introduction of new experiments into courses not  presently using NMR. All of
              the enhancements and additions to the  program require the use of high-field,
              broadband FT-NMR. The  request for this FT-NMR coordinates well with the
              completion of the  renovation project for the Gessner Science Building which
              includes  all new laboratory facilities, new additional instrumentation, 
              matches for NSF grants for instrumentation, and support services  and
              personnel. The acquisition of the FT-NMR will complete the  improvement of the
              chemistry curriculum at East Stroudsburg  University and will improve the
              vitality of the programs offered to  its students.
