Abstract    :
              An Institute for Science Education would be established that will  consist of
              the faculty, staff, and students from the fields of  science, mathematics,
              engineering, technology, and education of the  University of Wisconsin-Madison
              and the staff of the National  Center for Improving Science Education in
              Washington, DC.  The  Institute would invite distinguished scholars from
              throughout the  United States and other countries to work independent of
              on-going  EHR Directorate programmatic activities to examine science, 
              mathematics, engineering, and technology education in a  comprehensive fashion.
               The Institute plans to conduct long-term  and short-term research projects
              that result in new knowledge and  meaningful syntheses of knowledge about the
              effectiveness of the  total education system.    The goals outlined for the
              Institute are: to enhance the knowledge  base through improving evaluation of
              education models, programs,  and practices; to facilitate sharing of
              information about exemplary  practices; to strengthen the policy environment
              for education; and  to increase the effectiveness of exemplary programs and
              practices.
