Abstract    :
              9452667  Mendez    Metropolitan State College of Denver, in collaboration with
              the  Denver Public Schools, seeks to initiate a four-week summer  commuter
              program in mathematics for 48 disadvantaged and  traditionally underrepresented
              (women and minority) students  entering 7th and 8th grades, who have
              exceptional interest and high  potential in science, mathematics and/or
              engineering.  Students  will learn new mathematics with an emphasis on
              scientific  applications, working together in small problem solving groups.  
              They will study probability and statistics through hands-on  experiments
              involving data collection and analysis and descriptive  graphing techniques,
              curve fitting, and function approximation  models in multiple interdisciplinary
              contexts.  They will explore  chaotic phenomena and investigate functions,
              iterations, fixed  points, orbits, and their limits, fractals, and game theory.
               They  will focus on applications in various fields.  Students will 
              participate in extensive graphing calculator and computer  activities. 
              Additional components of the program include career  awareness, ethics and
              academic year follow-up activities.  ***
