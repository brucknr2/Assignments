Abstract    :
              9452732  Ober                Ball State University will initiate a four week,
              residential, Young  Scholars project in physics and engineering (focus on
              introductory  electronics) which emphasizes the use of electronics. Through 
              instructional and research activities, the program will introduce  24 high
              school students entering grades 11 and 12 to the use of  electronic
              instrumentation, integrated circuits, and signal  transducers. The program
              emphasizes the use of electronics as a  tool in the completion of an on-campus
              research project and a  follow-up academic-year research project.
