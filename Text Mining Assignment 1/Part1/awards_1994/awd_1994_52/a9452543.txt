Abstract    :
              9452543  Schaumberg                                                The purpose
              of this project is to introduce gas chromatography/mass  spectrometry (GC/MS)
              into the undergraduate curriculum in  chemistry. Students will utilize GC/MS
              techniques in courses  ranging from introductory chemistry to advanced senior
              level  courses including undergraduate research. Specifically the students 
              will be introduced to one of the most powerful analytical  techniques used in
              modern chemical laboratories. The proposed  Hewlett Packard GC/MS is very
              reliable and user friendly. This  instrument will significantly enhance the
              undergraduate curriculum  both by expanding experiments and by allowing the
              introduction of  new experiments.
