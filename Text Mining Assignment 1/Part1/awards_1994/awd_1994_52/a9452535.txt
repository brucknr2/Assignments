Abstract    :
              9452535  Mills                                The aim of this project is to
              modify laboratory exercises in Animal  Physiology at Central Missouri State
              University in order to  encourage students to use an open-ended approach in
              laboratory  experimentation. While the technology for collecting and analyzing 
              physiological events has progressed rapidly, the equipment  available to our
              students has not kept pace. We intend to modify  and enhance our present
              laboratory exercises which depend on chart  recording systems by addition of
              six computerized analog to digital  (A-D) data acquisition systems. Each system
              will include a  microcomputer, multi-channel A-D interface, and a series of 
              transducers and instruments designed to measure specific  physiological
              variables. The data once collected will be accessible  by students not only in
              the laboratory but also via local, campus,  and Internet networks. To
              supplement exercises involving collection  and analysis of data, interactive
              computer simulations will be  introduced to provide additional experience in
              proposing questions  and seeking solutions within the constraints of time and
              costs.
