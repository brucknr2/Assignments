Abstract    :
              9452820  Gray    The United Negro College Fund, Inc. requests a grant of $48,600
              to  hold a planning conference with published proceedings that will  review
              information complied on all existing programs in the  sciences, mathematics and
              engineering in its member colleges and  universities.  This conference will
              identify outstanding current  programs as well as main areas of need for
              improvement, and devise  a strategy of development of collaborative programs
              that could  significantly increase the retention and graduation rates in these 
              fields over a five-year period.
