Abstract    :
              9452127  Lyons                                We propose to purchase a scanning
              tunneling microscope (STM)/atomic  force microscope (AFM) instrument for use in
              the undergraduate  curriculum. Consistent with the increasing interdisciplinary
              nature  of science, the equipment will be used by both the chemistry and 
              physics departments. Most of the use will be in advanced chemistry  and physics
              courses, but the instrument will be demonstrated and  images from the
              instrument will be presented in introductory  chemistry and physics lectures
              also. Until recently, the high  expense and maintenance requirements of surface
              characterization  instruments have put them out of the reach of undergraduate 
              colleges. Improvements in STM/AFM technology have reduced data  acquisition and
              maintenance costs, allowing undergraduates at small  colleges to perform
              experiments on samples under ambient  conditions.
