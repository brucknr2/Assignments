Abstract    :
              9452721  Ohme  The project will conduct a regional self-study to determine 
              optimum strategies to accomplish systemic educational reform  and economic
              development in a region characterized by high  poverty and lack of resources. 
              The supervisory Steering  Committee will establish Task Forces which will
              conduct a  series of town meetings to facilitate local and regional 
              partnerships, collect and analyze baseline data, and provide  recommendations
              to the Steering Committee, for the  development of an integrated plan for
              sustainable education  reform throughout the region.  The Steering Committee
              will  hold a series of four area conferences, to inform and  include local
              representatives in the planning and  development process.
