Abstract    :

              Although electrophoresis is a very important analytical tool for  biochemistry
              and the life sciences, it is rarely considered as part  of an analytical
              instrumental laboratory course.  Capillary  electrophoresis (CE) is a
              relatively new technique that can  demonstrate both the separation power and
              quantitative capability  of electrophoresis in a short period of time.  Our
              undergraduate  students are carrying out CE experiments that demonstrate the 
              separation of closely related compounds such as optical isomers as  well as the
              basic theory.  A comparison of CE to standard gel  electrophoresis is also
              being made.  Both techniques have good  resolution capability but only CE is
              amenable to facile  quantitation.  In addition, two undergraduate research
              projects,  one in analytical chemistry and one in biochemistry, are using the 
              capillary electrophoresis instrument.
