Abstract    :
              9452593  Perkowski  This project involves the use of a Programmable Active
              Memory  (PAM), the commercially-available prototype of the inexpensive 
              hardware emulator/reconfigurable computer built in lookup-table  FPGA
              technology. This allows the enhancement of topics already  present in the
              curriculum. Moreover, it allows the introduction  into several undergraduate
              classes the new topics of hardare  emulation, reconfigurable computing,
              systolic processors, cellular  automata, and their high-level hardware
              description in language  VHDL.  Fast prototyping technology allows students to
              concentrate  more on the conceptual phases of design and not mundane ones.  
              Students are motivated to learn to build more sophisticated systems  of
              practical use. These curricular topics are taught to all  Electrical
              Engineering and Computer Engineering majors through  laboratory demonstrations,
              regular experiments, and projects in the  freshman, sophomore and junior years.
              Students wishing to  specialize in digital design (particularly robotics) and 
              communications, may take respective senior course sequences and  associated
              capstone design projects and use the fast system  prototyping technology to
              implement more advanced systems.
