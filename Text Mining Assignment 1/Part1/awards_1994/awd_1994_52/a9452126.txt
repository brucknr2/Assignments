Abstract    :
              The Biology Department recently implemented changes to the  laboratory
              components of its General Biology courses. The changes  institute an
              experimental approach to laboratory study centering on  open-ended
              investigative experiments and introducing selected  instrumentation,
              statistical analysis and formal report writing.  Each course contains three
              weeks of lab study of respiration; in  the first semester the focus is on
              anaerobic fermentation by yeasts  and in the second semester on whole organism
              respiration of  cockroaches. We presently use a modified Scholander apparatus
              that  measures gas pressure changes in a closed system. Funds are  requested
              for the purchase of Li-Cor Portable Photosynthesis  Systems, capable of rapid
              accurate measurements of CO2 fluxes  produced by living material placed within
              a measurement chamber.  These instruments will replace the relatively
              unreliable equipment  we are now using and will extend the instructional
              capability of  the laboratory in the following ways. The fast response time and
               high sensitivity of the system will allow each student to run more  replicates
              during a three hour laboratory, improving the  sensitivity of statistical
              analyses performed later.  Students will  be able to choose from a wider range
              of treatment effects when  designing their own investigations, because finer
              distinctions  among rates will be possible. In addition, the equipment will 
              significantly improve the quality of laboratory investigations into 
              photosynthesis in the General Botany course.
