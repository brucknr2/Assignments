Abstract    :
              9452289  McClain                                                   This project
              will strengthen the instructional quality of one  biology and three
              microbiology classes and laboratories by  incorporating current innovations and
              technology. The goal of this  curricular enhancement project is to improve the
              scientific  literacy of students. Cooperative group-learning activities will be
               incorporated into the lab and classroom assignments. This collegial  approach
              will be facilitated by the use of computer workstations  that will be utilized
              by groups of 5-7 students. A microscope/video  system will be used to provide
              more effective instruction  concerning the proper usage of microscopes. This
              system will enable  faculty to illustrate, for the class as a whole, important 
              techniques for understanding and mastering skills necessary for  proper and
              effective microscope usage. A laser disk player/TV  monitor system will also be
              utilized to fully integrate a system of  study and reference during lecture and
              group time. This pedagogy  incorporates the three elements of an exemplary
              biology program: an  investigative laboratory; use of biological techniques;
              and use of  computers. It also accommodates a variety of learning and teaching 
              strategies, fosters critical thinking and problem solving, includes 
              collaborative learning and fosters active student participation.
