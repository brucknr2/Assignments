Abstract    :
              9452039  Liu                                                       The purpose
              of the microprocessor development system is to  introduce undergraduate
              students to state-of-the-art development  tools and to provide them with
              hands-on training on the design of  microprocessor-based circuits. A network
              consisting of six PC's,  each equipped with an 8086/8087 emulator, a logic
              analyzer and a  universal IC programmer, is being implemented as the
              development  system. Students in microprocessor laboratory courses are able to 
              use this system to develop application programs, debug  microprocessor-based
              circuits, integrate software and hardware, and  test the integrated systems.
              These effective development tools also  enable students to design complicated
              microprocessor-based  projects, thus providing a greater flexibility for
              students in  choosing their senior design projects.
