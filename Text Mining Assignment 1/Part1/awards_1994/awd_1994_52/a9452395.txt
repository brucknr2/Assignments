Abstract    :
              9452395  Johnson                              The Department of Chemistry is
              acquiring a FT-IR for use in  sophomore organic chemistry laboratories and
              higher level courses  including undergraduate research.  In addition to the 
              characteristic uses in identifying functional groups and  characterizing
              products, following reaction progress, studying  kinetics and for obtaining
              data to calculate force constants and  bond lengths the instrument is being
              used in environmental studies  and in undergraduate research program.  Among
              the research  activities is the long term monitoring of mountain lakes,
              analyzing  dye residues in textile water treatment effluents, and air 
              pollution studies.
