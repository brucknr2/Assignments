Abstract    :
              9452679  Van Gaalen    Dordt College seeks to provide an enrichment experience
              in  engineering for a three-week, residential, residential, Young  Scholars
              program followed by academic year activities. The program  will serve 45

              introduce students to various scientific  and mathematical principles,
              particularly those involved in  engineering, and reinforce them through a
              series of well-planned  experiential activities. Activities include:
              lecture-oriented  sessions, laboratory exercises, field trips to local business
              and  industry, and research experiences which include student design  projects.
