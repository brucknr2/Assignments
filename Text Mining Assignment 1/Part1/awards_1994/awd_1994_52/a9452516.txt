Abstract    :
              9452516  Smith-Huerta         The objectives of this project are to improve
              undergraduate  laboratory instruction in plant morphology, anatomy, and 
              development in the Department of Botany at Miami University in  Oxford Ohio.
              This project develops a model for the incorporation of  advanced
              instrumentation and discovery-based teaching methods into  these courses which
              have traditionally been taught without the  benefit of modern instrumentation.
              The proposed improvements will  impact most heavily five different
              morphology/anatomy courses with  a total enrollment of about 200
              undergraduates. The project will  also benefit other courses in general botany,
              plant physiology and  plant ecology. This instrumentation will also be used by 
              undergraduates to conduct independent research projects and in  their capstone
              research experiences. The main focus of the  improvement will be the
              incorporation of modern instrumentation,  image processing, and computers into
              the existing discovery based  lab experience. Undergraduate majors, non-majors
              and pre-service  teachers will be stimulated and challenged to operate advanced
               instrumentation and develop problem solving skills using the same  techniques
              and equipment as research plant scientists.
