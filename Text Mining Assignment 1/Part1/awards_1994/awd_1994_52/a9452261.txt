Abstract    :
              9452261  Vilches                                                   Upper
              division (Junior and Senior) laboratories are, or should be,  the initial
              training ground in modern experimental methods.  We  have been developing three
              lines of related experiments where  students will be able to learn not only the
              technology of an  individual experiment, but also how knowledge on a particular
              theme  is acquired through the use of complementary information from many 
              probes.  The three lines of experiments follow electronic  properties of
              solids, phase transitions and critical phenomena, and  spectroscopy themes.  By
              purchasing an instructional X-ray  generator, a Fabry-Perot interferometer, a
              video data acquisition  system, and a few additional items we will be able to
              fully  implement our development plan.
