Abstract    :
              9452490  Browning                                                  This project
              involves a laboratory in interactive technology for  undergraduate instruction
              in political science. Instructional  software introduces undergraduate students
              to significant concepts  in political science. This software and program also
              combines data  on members of Congress with stored digital audio and video of
              these  members speaking on the House and Senate floor. Undergraduates have  an
              opportunity to learn political science in a laboratory that  provides access to
              current video, electronic text, and statistical  data, and is integrated with
              course instruction, exercises, and  student participation. In addition, the
              laboratory serves as a  national training facility for faculty and teachers.
