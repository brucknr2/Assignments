Abstract    :
              Active volcanoes provide a uniquely exciting environment in which  students can
              learn how to conduct field-based geologic research.   A new course, Field
              Volcanology, is based in the southern Cascades,  a region containing three
              active volcanoes with contrasting  eruptive styles.  The course extends the
              traditional geology field  camp curriculum by teaching how mapping can be used
              in conjunction  with other skills to address specific research questions. 
              Through  a series of integrated projects the participants learn how to  prepare
              detailed geologic maps and cross sections; install  equipment in the field;
              collect, analyze and interpret a variety of  original data; use field criteria
              to evaluate different eruption  models; and assess the state of activity and
              potential hazards of  each volcano.  By using this environment and teaching
              approach we  seek to produce motivated and well-trained young scientists who 
              will be better prepared for a professional career in whatever  subdiscipline
              they choose to pursue.  The proposed five-week Field  Volcanology course builds
              upon two of the major strengths of the  Geology Department at Arizona State
              University: its internationally  recognized program in volcanology and its
              undergraduate and  graduate curricula that are centered upon a variety of field
               courses.  It also takes advantage of some equipment purchased  through an
              earlier ILI grant for development of a field geophysics  course.
