              three-week,  summer residential, Young Scholars Project in inter-disciplinary 
              science for 48 students entering grades 11 and 12. Students will be  involved
              in laboratory research and research methodology in cross-  discipline approach
              with engineering, emphasizing team-building and  team communications. The
              objective of the program is to create a  high quality research opportunity for
              high school students who have  expressed interest in studying science or
              engineering at the post-  secondary level and to expose them to the culture of
              the  university's research community.
