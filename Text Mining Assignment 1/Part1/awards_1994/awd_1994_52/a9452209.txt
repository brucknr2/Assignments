Abstract    :
              9452209  Marovac  The objective of this project is to expand the multimedia 
              capabilities of our Multimedia and Software Engineering Laboratory  (MM&SE). 
              Currently, our laboratory has one SUN IPC workstation,  four IBM-PS2 Model 80
              PCs based on 80386 MPU, and an IBM AT with a  color monitor for high resolution
              graphics.  The laboratory is used  for class work and research in undergraduate
              courses that cover  multimedia, graphical user interface environments, computer
               graphics, and software engineering and a graduate course in  software
              engineering. However, for graphical interface  environments, computer graphics
              and software engineering courses we  occasionally also use departmental Sun
              4/110 workstations that are  shared with a number of other courses.  The
              improvement through   this project consists of an addition of 6 computers, 3
              Silicon  Graphics INDY multimedia workstations and  3 IBM multimedia 9557 DV 
              PCs.  All computers will be equipped with 16 bit audio, hardware  supported
              moving video and ISDN interfaces.  This project primarily  impacts our
              multimedia course and our undergraduate research  projects in multimedia.  The
              equipment is used in teaching full  multimedia including high quality audio and
              moving video.  However,  the project significantly affects our undergraduate
              courses in user  interface environments, raster graphics and software
              engineering.   The equipment is also used for a number of undergraduate
              research  projects involving development of multimedia tools supporting other 
              computer creative activities, e.g. a group development environment  in which
              the students can fully communicate with each other through  audio and real time
              video while working as a team on software  engineering projects.
