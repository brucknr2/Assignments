Abstract    :
              9452487  Coulson  The equipment described in this proposal will be used in lab
              work  for both engineering physics and principles of engineering  technology
              classes. Its purpose is to increase student involvement  in the learning
              process and to build student excitement through a  multi-dimensional learning
              lab. It will provide students with  multiple methods of investigation on topics
              and concepts covered in  class lectures that could not previously be
              experimented with in a  conventional lab. This will not only improve student
              understanding,  but will enhance their problem solving skills and promote
              proper  methods of scientific investigation. The equipment requested  includes
              six complete 486DX computer systems, each with a lab  interface, physics
              simulation software and assorted probes; two  printers; and two interactive
              videodisc systems. This equipment  will bring the latest technology into our
              labs, giving students the  ability to make investigations and acquire data
              through both  traditional and innovative techniques.  ***
