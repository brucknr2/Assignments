Abstract    :
              9452671  Steadman    The University of Wyoming seeks to initiate a three-week, 
              residential, Young Scholars program in engineering for 36 students  entering
              grade 12. The project provides students with classroom  lectures and
              discussions, field trips, hands-on laboratory and  research experiences in the
              specific engineering areas of material  science, environmental, and
              computer-assisted engineering. The  students are guided by experienced
              university faculty to develop  research methods and problem-solving skills.
              Projects developed  during their research experience are shared with classmates
              during  the academic year. Continued student involvement in engineering 
              related activities with the university takes place through video 
              tele-conferencing and participation in university sponsored  designed
              competitions.
