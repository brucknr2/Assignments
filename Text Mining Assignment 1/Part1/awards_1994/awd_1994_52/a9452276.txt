Abstract    :
              9452276  Morgan                                                    Recent
              developments in molecular technology have produced a  revolution in research on
              the evolutionary relationships of  organisms. Also, major evolutionary
              questions in all groups of  living organisms are now using molecular techniques
              and data such  as gene sequences. This project therefore enhances the
              evolutionary  education of our students through course work in  which they
              learn how modern evolutionary research is conducted.  They also conduct the
              research themselves, employing the most  useful modern molecular methods and
              instrumentation such as  sequencing apparatus and a temperature cycler for
              amplification of  genes. The project is expected to significantly enhance the 
              evolutionary education offered to undergraduate students and will  add breadth
              to our curriculum. It also gives students the  opportunity to learn firsthand
              how evolutionary research is  conducted, and allows them to use and become
              familiar with  current  molecular methods.
