Abstract    :
              9452702  White    Iowa State University seeks to initiate a four week,
              residential,  Young Scholars project in life sciences/biochemistry for 20 
              students entering grades 8 and 9.  The target groups are young  women,
              minorities including Pacific Islanders, and rural students.   This project
              introduces a hands-on approach, giving individual  participants the opportunity
              to develop their skills, to pursue  their own interests, and to initiate an
              independent research  project.
