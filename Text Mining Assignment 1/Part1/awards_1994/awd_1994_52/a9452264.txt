Abstract    :
              9452264  Schreiner                            Fourier transform nuclear magnetic
              resonance (FT-NMR) spectroscopy  has been established as the most important
              technique in the  identification and structural assignment of all organic and 
              organometallic compounds.  It also lends itself to structure  determination of
              biochemical macromolecules, and can be used to  study molecular dynamics.  The
              objective of this project is to  educate chemistry and other science majors in
              the theory and  operation of this powerful technique by introducing them to NMR
              at  a gradually increasing level of sophistication throughout the  entire
              chemistry curriculum.  Student use of the instrument occurs  in course ranging
              from introductory chemistry to undergraduate  research projects.  Starting with
              basic l-D 1H NMR, students  advance to multinuclear and 2-D methods.  This
              effectively ensures  proper training in modern NMR techniques for our students
              who go on  to industrial positions or excellent graduate schools.  In addition 
              to the students and faculty of Randolph-Macon College involved in  this
              project, one nearby Community College (J. Sargeant Reynolds)  and the local
              Mathematics and Science Center are using this  equipment.
