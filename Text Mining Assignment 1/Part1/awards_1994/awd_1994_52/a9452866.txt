Abstract    :
              9452866  Kozma    This unsolicited proposal has been prepared for submission to
              the  National Science Foundation's Program on Networking Infrastructure  for
              Education (NIE).  The proposal is for a 6-month grant for SRI  to engage in
              research and support activities of an extremely time-  sensitive nature.  The
              proposed project capitalizes on a unique  situation and a time-limited
              opportunity to both document and  support nascent efforts to install an
              educational version of the  information superhighway that is unparalleled in
              the country.    During this 6-month period we will (1) observe and document the
               rapidly changing events that are affecting the Castro Valley  Unified School
              District as they attempt to take advantage of  unusually rich technology
              opportunities while maintaining their  focus on their own educational and
              school restructuring goals, (2)  provide support and technical assistance to
              school district  personnel, and (3) engage a third party evaluator (external to
              SRI)  to review our methods and findings on an ongoing basis.  ***
