Abstract    :
              9452083  Best  The Biology Department at Colby College proposes to incorporate 
              basic physical principles and mathematical constructs into all  levels of the
              organismal, ecological and physiological curriculum  by adopting a
              biomechanical approach. While physiology is the study  of how organisms
              function, the new and rapidly emerging  subdiscipline of biomechanics
              emphasizes a physical and mechanical  approach to function. Both physiology and
              biomechanics rest upon an  understanding of basic physical and mechanical
              fundamentals. The  instrumentation proposed will allow us to include
              biomechanical  laboratory exercises which emphasize basic physical principles
              in  introductory and upper level courses, as well as courses for non-  science
              majors. In addition, the instrumentation will be  extensively utilized by
              students in independent and student/faculty  research projects.
