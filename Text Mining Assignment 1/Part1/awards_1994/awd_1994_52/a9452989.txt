Abstract    :
              9452989  Stombler    The Georgia Institute of Technology seeks partial funding
              from NSF  to host the U.S. Academic Decathlon on April 18-21, 1996.  The 
              United States Academic Decathlon is a high school program whose  goals include
              improving the status, recognition and popularity of  academic endeavors in
              every high school in the United States.  It  is based on the athletic model
              that includes practice, teamwork,  competition and recognition.  In 1996, 45
              teams will be brought  together to compete in the National Tournament.  The
              1996 theme,  "Cooperation and Competition," recognizes the 1996 Summer Olympic 
              Games to be held in Atlanta.  The 10 events include:  an essay;  speeches;
              interviews; written tests in mathematics, science  economics, social studies,
              humanities, fine arts and language and  literature; and a college bowl-like
              Super Quiz.  ***
