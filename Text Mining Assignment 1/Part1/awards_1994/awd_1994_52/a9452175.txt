Abstract    :
              This proposal addresses the critical necessity of introduction of  Concurrent
              and Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) into the  manufacturing engineering
              technology curriculum. A need for  engineering workstations arose to teach
              these topics. The computer  equipment presently on hand is limited to IBM
              Compatible and Apple  microcomputers.  The following will be accomplished as a
              result of  the proposed project: i) Teach Finite Element Analysis (FE A), 
              which is a fundamental CAE concept that is vitally important to  accomplish
              rigorous and thorough engineering analysis and design.   ii) Run Mechanical
              Design Automation (MDA) software which is  essential to implement Concurrent
              Engineering in a Computer  Integrated enterprise. MDA software, on account of
              their size and  processing requirements, are run on UNIX based engineering 
              workstation platforms. iii) Model true 3D solids and complex  surfaces which is
              required for mass property evaluation, generation  of sculpted surfaces for
              tool and mold design, rapid prototype  generation, and simulation of cutter
              paths in NC. iv) Issue  projects in plant simulation that are so essential to
              achieving  productivity enhancements in a dynamic manufacturing environment.
