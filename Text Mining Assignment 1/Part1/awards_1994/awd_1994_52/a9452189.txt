Abstract    :
              9452189  Browne  There is a very significant need to educate Mechanical
              Engineers in  fatigue failure of materials and associated components. In
              general,  consumer markets are expecting mechanical components and 
              machines--such as automobiles--to be safer, longer lasting, and of  higher
              quality. Freedom from fatigue--or repeated cycles--failure  is essential for
              all of these. At present in the Mechanical  Engineering curriculum at Mankato
              State University, fatigue is  covered in lecture but there is only one limited
              laboratory bench  top experiment to test fatigue failures. This project will
              use a  general purpose fatigue test machine as the focus of a new fatigue 
              laboratory which will allow students to conduct experiments and  student
              research projects, with the goal of providing them with a  strong working
              knowledge in this important area.  An innovative  feature is the use of short
              term experiments to predict long-term  behavior of materials.
