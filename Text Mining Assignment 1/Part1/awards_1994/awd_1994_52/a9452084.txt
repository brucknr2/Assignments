Abstract    :
              9452084  Geisler  The curriculum in the Department of Chemistry is being
              improved by  providing hand-on experience with modern instrumentation and 
              laboratory computers.  The introduction of a 200 MHz FT-NMR is  enhancing the
              students' experiences in organic chemistry, physical  chemistry, instrumental
              analysis and advanced inorganic chemistry  courses.  The students' exposure to
              FT-NMR occurs gradually but  steadily through classroom lectures and in the
              problem-solving  setting of the laboratories.  The project also is enhancing
              the  ability of the faculty to teach the fundamentals and advanced  aspects of
              NMR spectra interpretation. In addition, the instrument  is being used to
              illustrate a number of chemical concepts including  reaction stereochemistry,
              equilibria, kinetics, tautomerism, proton  exchange and magnetic moments.  An
              accessible NMR provides the  undergraduates with the opportunity to participate
              in research at  a higher level than would otherwise be possible.
