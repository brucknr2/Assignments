Abstract    :
              9452884  Radford    Three North Louisiana parishes, Caddo, Claiborne, and
              Bienville,  and Louisiana Tech University will collaborate to develop system- 
              wide plans to initiate systemic reform in science instruction.  A  steering
              committee consisting of teachers, supervisors, principals,  superintendents,
              university science and science education faculty,  the regional service center
              director, and business and lay persons  will oversee the project at the
              regional level.  Additional parish  personnel will serve on a task force for
              each parish.  In order to  make informed decisions about science reform, data
              will be  collected on successful science instructional strategies.  The 
              project will investigate varied science instructional formats such  as
              kit-based science instruction, integrated science programs,  technology-based
              instruction, and appropriate assessment  strategies.  Nationally recognized
              experts will address the above  areas at general planning meetings involving
              all three parishes.   Selected parish representatives and university personnel
              will visit  exemplary programs chosen by the steering committee.  Using what is
               learned about reform in science, each task force will develop a  specific plan
              for implementation of the chosen instructional  programs to bring about
              systemic reform in science for the parish.
