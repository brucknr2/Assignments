Abstract    :
              This project will make possible interactive, process-oriented  laboratory
              instruction throughout the biology curriculum.  Experiments will emphasize
              observation, measurement, organization  and analysis of data, and hypothesis
              formulation and testing.  Students will employ electrophoresis,
              spectrophotometry, and  centrifugation to investigate topics in biotechnology
              and molecular  biology, genetics, and environmental biology. Students will use 
              networked Macintosh workstations to and computer-based  instrumentation to
              investigate a variety of physiological  conditions, as well as to process and
              graph data. The new  laboratory environment will foster scientific inquiry and
              will help  students develop critical thinking skills.  Students also will use 
              computer-based post laboratory simulations to reinforce lecture and  laboratory
              activities. As well, computer augmented instruction will  afford a flexibility
              to better meet the needs of our single and  working parents. Faculty will use
              the Macintosh server as a  workstation to develop simulations supporting
              laboratory materials.  Published reports and presentations on the results of
              this project  will stimulate other community colleges to lab investigations 
              modeled on those from this project.
