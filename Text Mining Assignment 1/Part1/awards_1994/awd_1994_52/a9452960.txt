Abstract    :
              Computer-based training simulations can do more than teach facts and specialized
              skills, they can help students learn the high level skills involved in finding
              and evaluating information, solving problems, cooperating with colleagues, and
              resolving conflicts.  While the simulators used to train pilots or tank crews
              are very expensive, new generation of authoring tools will enable low-cost
              development of many broadly-used training and education simulations.  The new
              simulations will use personal computers and will build on evolving work on
              digital libraries and multimedia techniques.  The new authoring tools
              incorporate knowledge-based techniques for model-based simulation, automated
              planning, and concept-based information retrieval.  Military applications have
              demonstrated successful applications of these knowledge-based  techniques. 
              Authoring tools that package these techniques will allow trainers to develop
              simulations that adapt to varying learning levels and accommodate the
              opportunistic, exploratory behaviors of individual learners.  Reuse of the
              authoring tools, domain knowledge, digital libraries, help modules, and other
              software components will spread development costs over many simulations and
              make it cost effective to develop simulations that dramatically extend the
              effectiveness of training and education software.
