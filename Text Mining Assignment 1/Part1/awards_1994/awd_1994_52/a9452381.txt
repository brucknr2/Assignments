Abstract    :
              9452381  Scholz                                                    The College
              of St. Thomas is developing an undergraduate  computer-mathematics laboratory
              for classroom instruction and  student projects within the University's
              Department of Mathematics.  Applications of mathematics, visualization of data
              and functions,  and exploration of models and simulations area being
              investigated  in the facility. The University is providing a dedicated and 
              remodelled classroom for this laboratory.  This facility is vital  to the
              Department's planned calculus and undergraduate mathematics  reform and to the
              design of computer-aided courses and instruction.  The institution is currently
              planning for a complete restructure of  the present Calculus courses as well as
              significant changes in  Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, Applied
              Mathematical  Modelling, Numerical Analysis, Probability, and Statistics 
              instruction. All of the Calculus classes are being held in the  laboratory on a
              daily to weekly basis, enabling students to  experiment with mathematical
              ideas, concepts, and realistic  applications as they evolve from the lectures.
              Traditional lectures  are being supplemented and often replaced as students now
              use the  computer and powerful symbolic, numeric, and graphic software 
              packages to illustrate key ideas. The interactive nature between  written
              lecture and computer-aided instruction is a crucial aspect  of this approach.
