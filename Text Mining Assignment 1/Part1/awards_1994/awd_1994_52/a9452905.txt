Abstract    :
              9452905  Tornatzky  The project will focus on research universities in seven
              Southern  states (Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, 
              Oklahoma, and west Virginia) in a region-wide effort to upgrade  their
              technology transfer performance and practices.  Operating  under the auspices
              of the Southern Technology Council (STC), the  project will develop regional
              performance and practice  benchmarks; engage in widespread dissemination of
              those exemplary  practices and lessons learned; focus on accelerated
              professional  development efforts on institutions in EPSCoR states; and conduct
               policy analyses on relevant state and university-level practices.   The
              project will improve the university-based technology transfer  infrastructure
              of the Southern EPSCoR states and at the same time  fully document the impacts
              achieved.  It will also link with  major academic institutions from other
              states in the region to  use them as a source of best practices and to maximize
              networking  and information sharing.
