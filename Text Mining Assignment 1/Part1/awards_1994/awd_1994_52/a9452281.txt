Abstract    :
              9452281  Verma  This proposal addresses a new cost effective approach to
              laboratory  instruction to supplement the new and growing field of distance 
              learning. The Engineering Technology Department at Old Dominion  University
              offers televised upper-division programs at three  locations throughout the
              state of Virginia with other sites planned  for the future. In addition to
              these three main sites, there are  two satellite sites which receive only
              televised courses. The upper  division curriculum in Mechanical and Electrical
              Engineering  Technology programs are offered through a combination of televised
               and live courses taught on the campus of the community colleges  participating
              in the program. Inadequate laboratory facilities to  teach upper-division
              courses in Mechanical Engineering Technology  Program, at the remote sites, has
              been the biggest draw back of the  program since its inception. Two subject
              areas where laboratory  equipment is critical in maintaining the quality of the
              program are  Fluid Mechanics and Automatic Controls.  It is proposed to develop
               a Mobile Instructional Laboratory built inside a 4O feet long  trailer to
              house equipment for Fluid Mechanics and Automatic  Controls. The laboratory
              facility will move to one of the sites and  stay there for four weeks. It will
              be equipped with four modular  workstations which can be changed quickly to
              accommodate a variety  of equipment. Utilization of this facility for two
              subject areas  and between three sites offers a cost effective solution without
               comprising the quality of the program.
