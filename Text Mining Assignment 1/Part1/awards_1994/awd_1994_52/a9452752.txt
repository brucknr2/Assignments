Abstract    :
              9452752  McNeil    Norfolk State University seeks to initiate a five-week,
              commuter,  Young Scholars program in mathematics and chemistry for 40 minority 
              students entering grades 8 and 9 in the Tidewater, Virginia area.  Students
              will engage in hands-on laboratory activities, including  experiments in water
              chemistry, and will use graphics calculators  and personal calculators to
              assist in the analysis of water-related  data. The project features field
              trips, career exploration  activities, and academic year follow-up activities.
              The major goal  of the project is to increase students' ability and confidence
              in  mathematics and science applications and hereby encourage them to  pursue
              careers in these fields.
