Abstract    :
              9452481  French                               The project enhances and
              integrates facilities in the biology and  psychology departments and improves
              the laboratory experiences of  non-biology and psychology students enrolled in
              general-education  (biology and psychology) and upper division (psychology)
              courses.   Two laboratories and two learning centers, connected via the campus 
              network, have been outfitted with computer controlled laboratory  equipment
              (spectrophotometers, oxygen probes, image analyzers, A/D  converters to allow
              students to engage in computer-assisted  experimentation and to review
              exercises.  Extensive use of  interactive multimedia (digitized video and audio
              and videodiscs),  virtual instruments, simulations and on-line access to
              textbooks  supplement all laboratories.  The equipment provides for improved 
              exercises for a general-education biology course, with its unusual  and perhaps
              unique curriculum of ecology, genetics and evolution,  and allowed the
              investigators to introduce laboratory experiences  into the psychology courses
              that lacked them.
