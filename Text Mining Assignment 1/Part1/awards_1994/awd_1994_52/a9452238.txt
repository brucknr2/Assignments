Abstract    :
              9452238  Chapin                                                    Students'
              skills in biotechnology are enhanced by the introduction  of molecular biology
              experiments into four freshman-sophomore  courses.  Students are also offered
              the opportunity to design and  implement research projects using the laboratory
              techniques of  molecular biology in a newly developed biology course.
