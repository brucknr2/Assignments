Abstract    :
              9452459  Pariser  The objective of this project is to provide experimental
              apparatus  (fiber optic communication's) for the students in the electronic 
              communication classes. The course Electronic Communication (CM  101), which
              teaches analog and digital communications, and the  second course which is an
              elective course, Modern Communication  Systems (CM 102).    As the industry
              moves toward fiber optics, we have a responsibility  to train our students in
              this technology. This training would  provide a major improvement for our
              students. They would now have  the opportunity to see experimental verification
              of the theory of  optical communications.
