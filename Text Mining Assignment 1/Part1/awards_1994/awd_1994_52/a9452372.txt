Abstract    :
              9452372  Perry  A computer laboratory is developed that is used for advanced 
              transfer and vocational work in operating systems, networking, and  graphics.
              Such an environment allows our students practice in:   network administration
              tasks in a UNIX environment; object-oriented  design and programming in a
              development environment; writing and  using graphical user interfaces;
              programming using 3D graphic  design.  The laboratory is connected through the
              ethernet to the  main laboratory supporting the rest of our two-year transfer
              and  vocational programs.  The main laboratory is in the process of  being
              partially updated through the use of severely limited,  state-provided,
              one-time funds connected to the construction of a  new Advanced Technology
              Center on campus, which will provide  laboratories for video, computing,
              engineering and manufacturing  technologies.  The 22 station laboratory
              described in this project  is a detachable network with 22 Sun ClassicLX
              workstations, a Sun  Sparcsystem 10 model 40 to connect the workstations to our
              main  laboratory network, and appropriate software needed by our advanced 
              students to teach UNIX systems administration, UNIX systems  programming,
              networking in a UNIX environment, UNIX shell  programming, object-oriented
              programming in a development  environment, GUI programming, and 3D graphics
              programming.
