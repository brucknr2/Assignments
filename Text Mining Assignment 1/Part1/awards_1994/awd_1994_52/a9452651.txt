Abstract    :
                We propose an interdisciplinary training program, based on student  recruiting
              in chemistry, physics and engineering, focused on the  application of high
              performance computing to scientific research.   The research focus of this
              program - molecular dynamics simulations  which seek to characterize the
              behavior of complex systems of many  interacting "particles" (ranging from
              atoms in proteins to stars in  the galaxy) - is an important unifying theme in
              applying high  performance computing to several critical areas of science and 
              technology.    Our program builds on the strengths of the Center for
              Computational  Science at Boston University which has served as a focal point
              for  interdisciplinary research collaboration of the PI's.  Since 1988,  we
              have pioneered the development of massively parallel  supercomputing in an
              academic context on our Connection Machine.    The GRT program will provide an
              organized framework of seminars,  discussions and facilities which will bring
              graduate students from  different disciplines together to focus on common
              computational  themes which arise in the effective exploitation of high 
              performance computing in science.  The training program will  include teaching
              and internship options.
