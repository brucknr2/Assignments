Abstract    :
                9452761  Donaldson                Howard University seeks to initiate a four
              week Young Scholars  project in mathematics for 45 high school students
              entering grades  9 and 10 in the Washington, D.C. area. A variety of problem
              solving  and hands-on activities integrated with research activities in 
              mathematics will be provided. Extensive use is made of computers  and graphing
              calculators as aids in learning and applying the  mathematical ideas. Career
              exploration is an important feature of  the program with special interest in
              stimulating student career  interest in mathematics and scientific fields.
