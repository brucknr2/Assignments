Abstract    :
              9452700  Abraham    The University of Tulsa seeks to initiate a four-week,
              residential,  Young Scholars program in engineering for 36 students entering 
              grades 9 and 10. The primary components of this program are the on-  campus
              sessions at the university where the scholars interact with  engineering
              faculty, undergraduate engineering students, and  representatives from
              industry. Specific activities include hands-on  engineering laboratory
              experiments, an engineering design project,  industrial site visits, workshops
              in engineering ethics, and  computer training sessions. One of the goals of the
              program is to  make engineering as a career come alive for the young scholars, 
              especially Native Americans, while at the same time help them to  understand
              the educational foundation they must acquire in high  school in order to
              confidently and competently pursue an  engineering career.
