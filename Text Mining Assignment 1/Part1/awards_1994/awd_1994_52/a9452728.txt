Abstract    :
              9452728  Ebert-May                Northern Arizona University will initiate a
              five week Young  Scholars Program (YSP) with a Mathematics and Science Teaching
               Perspectives (MSTP) in the fields of ecology and environmental  science for 35
              students and 7 teachers. The program is designed as  a cooperative effort among
              seven states in the Rocky Region:  Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, New
              Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming.  Research teams are composed of 35 high potential
              rising 10th and  11th grade students, high school teachers, and scientists.  
              Students and teachers will work at a long-term ecological research  site in
              Arizona during the summer, and then return to their states  to work on
              interdisciplinary research problems at their respective  school research site
              with assistance from university scientists and  scientists from their states.
