Abstract    :
              9452803  Belgarde  The project will establish a formal coalition among tribal 
              representatives in the Upper Great Plains region.  The  coalition will include
              representatives from state and  private agencies and from federally funded
              projects in the  region, concerned with American Indians education.  The PI 
              and his executive committee will convene an organizing  conference to begin
              discussions, reinforce connections,  examine the implications of systemic
              reform, and identify an  organizational structure to begin preparation for
              writing  and submission of a Development project proposal.
