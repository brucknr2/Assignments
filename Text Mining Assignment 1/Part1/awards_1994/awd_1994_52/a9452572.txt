Abstract    :
              This project seeks funding for a state-of-the-art computer lab  which will
              incorporate instructional technology to empower  students in undergraduate
              economics courses. This lab will help  students increase their capacity for
              inquiry, logical thinking,  critical analysis, and synthesis; work
              collaboratively; build  progressively on their software knowledge; and
              integrate  instructional technology and economic learning in their  capstone
              experience. The results of research on the impact this  lab has on learning
              economics and on students attitude toward  economics will be presented at
              national and regional economics  conferences, submitted to relevant economics
              journals, and made  available on the Internet.
