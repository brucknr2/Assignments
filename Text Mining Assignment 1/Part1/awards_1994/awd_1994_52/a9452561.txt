Abstract    :
              9452561  Burnett                                                   The goal of
              the project is to provide ongoing laboratory  experiences for undergraduate
              majors and non-majors in Biology,  Botany, Environmental Biology, and
              Microbiology that will enhance  their investigative skills and stimulate their
              interest in  scientific issues.  The proposal originates from the Biology 
              Department at Illinois Eastern Community Colleges, a two-year, 
              publicly-supported college in southeastern Illinois. The students  served by
              IECC and the Biology Department are largely from rural  areas, having attended
              high schools where science programs are  limited by a lack of funds and
              instructional resources. Since class  sizes are often very small, many local
              high schools are often  hardpressed to provide fulltime science faculty. As a
              result, the  community college system provides the first opportunity many rural
               students have to become familiarized with investigative science and  more
              sophisticated scientific tools & methods. The proposed  laboratory improvement
              project is designed to change students'  perception of science as simply a
              succession of "cookbook  experiments" and allow them to explore, in depth, a
              key scientific  issue - the significance of phytoplankton (commonly referred to
              as  algae), in the ecosystem. The addition of a modern culture  incubator
              system in the college's laboratory will provide the  vehicle for supporting
              this investigative approach to undergraduate  science.
