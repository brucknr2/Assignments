Abstract    :
              9452010  Thomas                                                    The
              Department of Mathematics at Colorado State University is  developing and
              implementing a renewed calculus/ordinary  differential equations sequence that
              includes approximately one  hour per week of computer laboratory work. The
              renewed  calculus/ordinary differential equations sequence uses the computer 
              algebra software Maple to (1) graphically illustrate basic concepts  in
              calculus and ordinary differential equations, (2) emphasize the  trilogy
              between data, graphics and formulas, (3) give students an  experimental tool
              for investigating mathematics and the solution of  mathematical problems and
              (4) enable students to attack problems  too difficult to attempt using paper
              and pencil.
