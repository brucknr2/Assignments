Abstract    :
              9452227  Joyner                                                   
              Hampden-Sydney College, a four-year liberal arts college in  Virginia, offers
              baccalaureate programs in the natural sciences in  biology, chemistry, physics,
              and interdisciplinary areas. The  physics department maintains an unusually
              large enrollment in  physics with more than 30% of the student body enrolled in
              a  physics course, due in large part to an aggressive laboratory  program at
              all levels.  This project will upgrade the laboratories  in four courses which
              follow the introductory course. The areas  selected are nuclear, low
              temperature, and X-ray fluorescence. The  use of the requested equipment in
              these four courses is expected to  increase our retention of majors among
              students coming out of the  introductory course. We also expect a measurable
              impact on the  number of majors coming out of these introductory courses: a
              goal  of 5% physics majors in a graduating class does not seem  unreasonable,
              given our present 3% ratio.   (At 5%, our major  productivity would be ten
              times the national average of one-half  percent.) The requested equipment will
              also be available to  students in our two local high schools and in the local
              community  college, on a late-afternoon basis.
