Abstract    :
              This project involves  a new computerized laboratory that students  use in all
              psychology courses. This lab engages students in active  learning through a new
              program of Research Across the Curriculum  that parallels the department's
              successful Writing Across the  Curriculum program. The project also builds on
              the revised  introductory psychology course. Research experiences are
              integrated  in a developmental sequence across all four years of the 
              curriculum. Experiments include computer simulations, data  collection,
              statistical analyses, computer modeling of  psychological processes,
              computerized psychological tests, on-line  access to scientific information,
              and graphic analyses.  The  project has particularly enabled the department to
              offer a newly  approved year-long neuroscience laboratory course and innovative
               research lab components in other psychology courses.
