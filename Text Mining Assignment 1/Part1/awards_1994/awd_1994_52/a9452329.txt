Abstract    :
              9452329  Fleshman  The Electronics program at Wytheville Community College is 
              developing a computer integrated manufacturing (CIM) cell to  increase the
              industrial electronics skills of its students. The  CIM cell will enable second
              year electronics students to perform  laboratory experiments and receive
              training in robotics, vision  systems, local area networks, programmable
              controllers,  programming of CNC machines, troubleshooting individual systems, 
              and every aspect of computer integrated manufacturing. The  student will see
              and work with real world applications, making  them more attractive and
              valuable employees to industry. The  center will also be a resource for the
              Drafting and Design and  the Machine Technology programs.
