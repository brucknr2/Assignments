Abstract    :
              9452046  Mooers                                                    By
              incorporating the use of technology in mathematics classes at  Whatcom
              Community College, the faculty seek to increase student  retention, enhance
              success and improve matriculation.  The result  is to provide a better
              foundation for scientific and technological  literacy. All mathematics faculty
              are provided with hands-on  resources and on-site professional development
              training to devise  and incorporate laboratory components utilizing the TI-82
              graphing  calculator in algebra, precalculus and calculus courses. By 
              providing classroom sets of TI-82 calculators and projections  units, all
              mathematics classrooms have vital technology which  facilitates both group
              discussions of mathematics and the overhead  projection of student and faculty
              presentations.  A set of  calculators for the library provide student with
              access to the  technology outside of the class time.  The project is predicated
              on  the belief that the collaborative nature of laboratory learning  moves the
              student from a passive role to one of an active learner,  injecting a new
              spirit of investigation into learning. The graphing  calculator is a tool by
              which abstract concepts and concrete  experiences are bridged, changing the way
              mathematics is taught and  learned.
