Abstract    :
              9452693  Brand    This proposal seeks to initiate a one year pilot Young
              Scholars program lasting  4-weeks in the summer, in Advanced Technology
              Education for twenty four high school students.  The program will emphasize
              advanced technology, design, applications.  In addition to several other
              applications, Computer Aided Design (CAD) projects will integrate various
              components of technology and its uses.  Evening seminars will be concerned
              with: ethics and other topics concerning technology and the citizen.  There
              will be field trips to major industrial locations where advanced technology is
              used, as well as recreation and reading during the weekends and evenings. 
              Students who exhibit a high potential for careers as technicians will be
              recruited nationally for the program.   ***
