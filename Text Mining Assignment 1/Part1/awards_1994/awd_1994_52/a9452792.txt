Abstract    :
              9452792  Bartlett    This three year project will develop curricular materials
              based on  the use of Landsat Thematic Mapper data as a learning tool for 
              students in grades 5-12.  As part of "Forest Watch," the students  will be
              involved in environmental monitoring activities, ranging  from hands-on
              assessment of local tree species to evaluating the  Landsat data for their own
              hometown.  The curriculum, which will be  written by scientists and teachers,
              will include activities that  integrate field- and laboratory-based studies of
              the health of the  white pine tree, a known bioindicator of tropospheric ozone 
              exposure.  These materials will be evaluated and disseminated  through a series
              of collaborative educative workshops involving the  grades 5-12 teachers, their
              students, and university scientists in  a regional environmental monitoring
              research effort.  The effort  includes authentic problem-solving and data
              gathering activities  such as ground truthing, laboratory analysis of branch
              and foliar  samples from the white pine, and the processing, analysis and 
              display of Landsat data of each school area.  This grant will be  administered
              by the Institute for the Study of Earth, Oceans and  Space (EOS) at the
              University of New Hampshire in conjunction with  WGBH, public television in
              Boston.
