Abstract    :
              9452006  Hampikian                                                 The
              Cooperative Laboratory in Biotechnology introduces pre-service  middle level
              science teachers to the scientific method and modern  research. Students
              perform original research as a cooperative  group, parelleling a project
              underway at a neighboring research  laboratory. Through this experience,
              students are trained in modern  biotechnology and are prepared for future
              in-service research  opportunities.  This senior course is designed to break
              down the  barrier between prospective teachers and local researchers. 
              Investigative topics for each term are chosen in consultation with  principal
              investigators from nearby laboratories. These scientists  have agreed to assist
              in class experiments, and will give seminars  explaining their own studies. In
              addition, students will choose a  local research group to follow and will
              prepare a fellowship  proposal for future in-service research.  This course
              will be  required of all science education majors and will be open to other 
              students as space permits.
