Abstract    :
              9452920  Ferguson    The INTERNET MULTIMEDIA APPLICATIONS WORKSHOP is designed
              to:    1.   provide training for 100 Nebraska teachers to use the internet     
               to retrieve information concerning health care and direct       connect
              software using NASA imagery from Voyager I and II, and       the Viking
              spacecrafts to obtain information about space       exploration.    2.  
              network teachers with technology experts for continual on-line       support
              through Phase II and beyond, and    3.   prepare teachers to conduct Phase II
              with 4,000 students to       participate in The Great Debate, National
              Priorities for tax       dollars, health care or space exploration.    During
              Phase I, United States Senators Bob Kerrey and Paul Simon  will present a
              dilemma for debate, "National Priorities: should tax  dollars be spent for
              health care or space exploration?" This  interactive session with the senators,
              100 on-site teachers, and  teachers on-line in Iowa, Kansas, and Illinois, sets
              the stage for  the four rotating hands-on training sessions with the award
              winning  education/technologists.  Teachers will develop and implement 
              application skills in global technologies, such as internet, CD-  Room,
              digitizing imagery, remote sensing imagery, E-mail, file  transfer, and Gopher
              sites.    Phase II is the implementation follow-up phase and occurs in the 
              classroom as children use the internet resources and software to  research
              information on health care and space exploration.  The  three week Great Debate
              occurs on-line with children among four  states.    This unique workshop and
              on-line debate will result in having 100  teachers and 4,000 children actively
              accessing internet resources  and direct connect software from NASA.  These
              teachers and children  will serve as trainers for other teachers. 
              Additionally, a viable  network will be in place among teachers, researchers,
              scientists,  and education technologists.  An action plan is already in process
               to refine and replicate this technology/interdiscipli nary  curricular model
              in other schools in other states.  Another major  accomplishment to result from
              this project is having children  explore careers in science, mathematics, and
              technology and  begin  to fill the need of 700,000 more experts in these fields
              b 2010.   It is intended for this project to also motivate and excite  children
              about studying mathematics, science, engineering, and  technology to propel
              United States children to be first in the  world:  a step toward the American
              2000 goal.  ***
