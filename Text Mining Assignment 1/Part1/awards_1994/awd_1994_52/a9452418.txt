Abstract    :
              9452418  King  The goal of the Harvey Mudd College Engineering Department is to 
              assemble a Design Center which allows product and process design  via software
              simulation. We expect our design center to be capable  of down loading data
              files to appropriate manufacturing equipment  for prototype manufacture.
              Further, the Center will be capable of  collecting test data from the
              manufactured prototypes to compare  with predicted simulations.    We have
              assembled the equipment and software needed to perform computer  simulations in
              mechanical, electrical and chemical engineering fields. We  have also acquired
              several data acquisition systems. Funding is now  requested to expand the
              Design Center to incorporate manufacturing  capabilities. Specifically, we
              request money for a three axis CNC mill  and an automated circuit board
              manufacturing machine.    The acquisition of this equipment will allow us to
              continue our  development of a coherent engineering training discipline rooted
              solidly  in design. By providing our students with the capabilities of
              performing  simulation, manufacturing, and testing while teaching them
              engineering  fundamentals, we can continue to develop broad-based engineers 
              well-practiced in the art of engineering design.
