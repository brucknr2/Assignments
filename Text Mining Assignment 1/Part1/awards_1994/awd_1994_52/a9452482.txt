Abstract    :
              9452482  Pai  Instrumentation for the enhancement of research training of 
              students allows the department to incorporate semester-long  research projects
              in courses for both undergraduate majors and  non-majors.  Students explore
              different aspects of original  research approaching a problem from many
              directions. Drosophila  melanogaster is the experimental model of choice for
              both  scientific and practical reasons.  The new equipment includes  incubators
              to provide controlled environments; microscopes and a  micromanipulation system
              with video capabilities to analyze embryos  and teach up-to-date techniques.
              Projects are carried out in a  variety of upper division courses: a contrast of
              natural selection  and artificial selection in a non-major course in the
              context of  evolution; crosses to induce the excision of plasmids from 
              transformed flies in Genetics; in situ hybridization experiments  for
              Experimental Molecular Biology (EMB); microinjection of  protoplasts and
              embryos in EMB and Embryology. Experiments and  analyses based on these
              projects serve as projects for Honors and  Independent Research Projects.   ***
