Abstract    :

              generates enormous enthusiasm  among undergraduates.  The organic chemistry
              laboratory sequence is  being remodeled to take this fact into account.  This
              course is  populated primarily by biology majors and chemistry majors.  
              Students are working individually, but sharing their results within  a group of
              eight students.  The research projects for this lab  sequence include the
              isolation and identification of secondary  plant metabolites, a study of the
              Claisen-Schmitt formation of  chalcones, and an investigation of substitution
              reactions.  These  experiments were chosen in consultation with the biology
              department  in order to emphasize the important of chemistry to the study of 
              biology.  The students working on these projects are using  instrumentation
              presently available in the department as well as a  GC-MS and an HPLC.  Both of
              these instruments are greatly enhancing  the students' laboratory experience. 
              In order to provide further  connections between biology and chemistry, both
              instruments are  also being used in the plant biology courses.
