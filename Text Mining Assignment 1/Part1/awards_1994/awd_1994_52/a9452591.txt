Abstract    :
              9452591  Swope                                                     An upper
              division biotechnology course provides an extensive  laboratory experience,
              enabling interested students to plan and  execute an undergraduate research
              project in this area. The  principle investigators, a biologist and a chemist,
              are the core of  a multidisciplinary research team designed to promote
              participation  of majors in undergraduate research projects in the emerging
              field  of biotechnology.
