Abstract    :
              9452609  Lahamer  Berea College will modernize an instrument-based physics
              laboratory  for physics students. The laboratory work will be coordinated with 
              two two-semester courses covering topics in mechanics, electricity  and
              magnetism, waves and optics, and modern physics. Emphasis of  this project is
              on modernizing and adding new experiments in modern  physics including nuclear
              spectroscopy and installing  computer-based data acquisition systems for
              measurement, control,  and analysis of physical systems with direct interfaces
              to the  phenomena under investigation. These systems will allow voltage 
              measurements at up to 60 kHz sampling frequency, interval timing,  and curve
              fitting and graphing. The requested equipment will  greatly enhance the basic
              goals of developing an appreciation of  the scientific method, demonstrating
              basic physical principles,  teaching the practice and theory of measurement and
              providing the  opportunity for students to use laboratory instruments. Our 
              implementation of these goals will have the additional benefit of  introducing
              the students to current analytical techniques for  materials analysis, and to
              computer data acquisition and analysis.
