Abstract    :
              Both teaching and research in plant biology are improved by  providing students
              with opportunities for investigative experiences  in the areas of plant ecology
              and physiology. In the required  introductory plant biology course, students
              measure the effects of  environmental variation. Research-based laboratory
              modules enhance  students' knowledge of physiological processes and of
              scientific  inquiry. Advanced ecology students study the importance of 
              environmental variation on primary production in lakes of  contrasting water
              quality. Experiments designed by ecology students  test hypotheses concerning
              the effects of environmental variation  on plant structure, and research
              projects may involve collaborative  studies in plant physiology, ecology, and
              molecular biology.  Students also gain an understanding of plant processes
              affected by  environmental variation; an improved ability to design, execute, 
              and interpret experiments; and an increased appreciation of the  role of plants
              in ecological systems.
