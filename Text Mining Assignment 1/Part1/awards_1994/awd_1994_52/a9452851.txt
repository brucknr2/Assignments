Abstract    :
              9452851  Maier    This project develops a seamless K-8 mathematics curriculum
              that  emphasizes visual thinking consistent with the NCTM Standards.   The
              curriculum extends and revises existing materials developed  and published by
              The Math Learning Center.  These materials  include Box It or Bag It
              Mathematics (grades K-2), Opening Eyes  to Mathematics (grades 3-4), and the
              Visual Math Course Guides  (grades 5-8).  The later is part of the Math and The
              Mind's Eye  materials developed with support from NSF.  In addition to 
              extending and revising these materials, the project prepares an  Overview that
              provides a synopsis of the curriculum, including  it's philosophical
              foundations.  The Overview identifies the  major mathematical strands and
              traces their development through  various parts of the curriculum.  The
              Overview also contains a  scope and sequence of the series and suggestions for
              managing  materials, alternate methods of assessment, and appropriate 
              instructional strategies. The series does not contain a textbook,  but does
              include printed materials consisting of course guides  and other resources for
              teachers, suggestions for students'  projects and homework, and blackline
              masters for student pages.    The defining characteristic of this curriculum is
              its emphasis on  visual thinking.  The curriculum is designed to improve
              students'  ability to communicate mathematically, increase their  understanding
              of mathematical concepts, and improve their  attitudes toward mathematics.  ***
