Abstract    :
              9452058  Hawkins                                                   This project
              provides students with the use of solid modeling  software techniques to create
              both Machine and Architectural/Civil  designs on RISC 6OOO computers. The
              integrity of these designs will  be analyzed using materials analysis software.
              Three-dimensional  wire-frame drawings will also be created. These wire-frame
              drawings  will be projected into two dimensional drawings when appropriate. 
              After intellectual property protection (also a part of this class)  has been
              addressed, the design ramifications and the results of the  design analysis
              will be communicated to the class using formal  academic papers and
              presentations. If the design is of sufficient  quality and innovation, it will
              then be submitted to manufacturers.  Designs in the initial year of funding
              will involve materials  handling options. These Designs will be created which
              facilitate  those covered under the Americans With Disabilities Act to perform 
              shipping and receiving tasks. This proposal also includes a  three-year study
              designed to evaluate workable hardware/software  options when teaching solid
              modeling.  By combining solid modeling,  wire-frame construction, design
              theory/problem solving, journal  creation, communications of the design and the
              implications of  intellectual property protection, this capstone class provides
              a  culmination of the baccalaureate experience.
