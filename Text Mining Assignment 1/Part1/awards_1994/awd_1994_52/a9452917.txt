Abstract    :
              9452917nn    Konold    This is a SGER grant.  The purpose of this project is to
              test the  feasibility of a design for documenting and analyzing the nature of 
              difficulties that arise when students are in the process of  analyzing real
              data to solve realistic problems in realistic  situations.  The studies will
              include interviews with high school  students at the end of an introductory
              course in data analysis.
