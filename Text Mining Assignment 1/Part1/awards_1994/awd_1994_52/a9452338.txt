Abstract    :
              9452338  Pifer  Until recently our physics major program was narrowly directed
              at  preparing a small number of elite students for graduate studies.  The
              current employment situation has made it clear to us that we  can no longer
              take the narrow view that graduate school is the only  reasonable career goal
              for a scientifically able student, and in  fact, there are many technically
              able students who would like to  major in physics yet are not interested in
              graduate school. Many of  these students are minorities or women. In response
              to these  students' career interests, we have recently introduced an Applied 
              Physics Major. The Applied option emphasizes a breadth of technical  experience
              with an emphasis on experimental skills, and is intended  for students who plan
              to seek industrial jobs immediately after  graduation. The centerpiece of the
              option is a 3-credit, junior-  level applied physics lab course. This lab
              currently uses  experiments from our modern physics lab that are designed for 
              students headed toward graduate school. We are requesting funds to  introduce
              five applied-type experiments that are built around the  needs of these
              students and involve modern instrumentation and  experimental techniques of the
              type that students will encounter in  industry. We are initially concentrating
              on two areas -- the  scanning tunneling microscope and modern optics. The
              experiments to  be introduced are the scanning tunneling microscope, the He-Ne 
              laser, saturated absorption spectroscopy, holography, and the dye  laser.
