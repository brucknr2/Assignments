Abstract    :
              9452988  McCully  The Fresno community and the School District, led by new
              superintendent, Charles McCully came together to elevate the quality of
              education for the children a year before responding to USI. However, it is
              clear that the development of the Fresno Urban Systemic Initiative , guided by
              the goals and framework  of the national USI, has enabled the City and District
              to give concrete form in mathematics, science and technology to their original
              vision.   Evidence of this vision made concrete includes:  the alignment of
              mathematics and science content with recently raised state and national
              standards; pedagogy selected to facilitate children's exposure to the thinking
              skills needed to access the new more complex curriculum; and changing policies
              that will advance USI reforms. The Fresno USI team has recognized and begun to
              develop innovative solutions to  one of its greatest challenges that is to
              ensure that students with limited English proficiency have equitable access to
              all of the reform efforts, especially curricular and instructional
              improvements. Two important strengths essential to reform of the Fresno Unified
              School District are revealed by these two accomplishments: they can  move
              rapidly from a vision to concrete achievements, and they can respond to
              deficiencies such as attention to the needs of the Limited English Proficient
              (LEP) students pointed out by the first review panel. Also,it,s important to
              note that  Fresno's many other strengths greatly heighten the probability that
              they will achieve their goals.These are:  clear strategies for accomplishing
              goals; strategies and programs to provide  access to mathematics and science
              reforms for students with Limited English Proficiency (LEP); an outstanding
              technology plan; commitment to the USI plan from the Teachers Union; the
              project director's broad knowledge and awareness of the importance of finding
              and observing successful models; an effort to seek out more cost effective
              methods; and broad-based and committed community  support. Finally,their
              reforms demonstrate the belief that all children can learn when provided with
              appropriate support as delineated in their USI plan                   ??
