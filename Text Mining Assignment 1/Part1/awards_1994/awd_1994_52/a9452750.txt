Abstract    :
              9452750  Krasny    Cornell University seeks to initiate a six-week, residential 
              Young Scholars program in the environmental sciences for 20  students entering
              twelfth grade.  The program will include a one-  week orientation at Cornell's
              Arnot Forest, a five-week on-campus  component focusing on research, careers,
              community outreach,  multimedia computer presentations, science ethics,
              follow-up  activities in schools, after-school science clubs, 4-H clubs, and 
              other informal educational settings.  A six-week Mathematics and  Science
              Teaching Perspectives component will be included, through  which four high
              school science teachers will engage in composting  and environmental toxicology
              research  and science education  activities at Cornell.  Teachers will design
              research curricula  and kits that will enable them to continue their research
              with  students in classrooms and after-school science clubs.  ***
