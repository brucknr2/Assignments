Abstract    :
              This project focuses on the introductory biology course sequence  for science
              majors and the general education biology course for  non-science majors. It
              consists of three activities: 1. An  introductory biology course for science
              majors which fully  incorporate micro-computer and CD-ROM technology. 2.
              Addition of a  micro-computer based laboratory to Contemporary Biology, the 
              current lecture only course for non-majors. 3. Development of a  resource
              manual of laboratory activities used by all the biology  faculty. The resource
              manual is organized into modules based on the  framework of unifying principles
              as outlined by BSCS and reflects  reforms recommended by AAAS in Project 2061.
              Each module includes  activities appropriate for varying levels of student
              backgrounds  and interest.
