Abstract    :
              9452617  Karmon                                              This project
              addresses community college students who are planning  to major in Engineering
              and Physics.  Traditionally, many students  lack intuition for the underlying
              physical concepts, and as a  result the physics and calculus courses present a
              major hurdle for  beginning students, especially women and minorities. This
              project  will improve the learning, retention, and application of physics 
              concepts and principles by physics and calculus students at Diablo  Valley
              College. This will be accomplished by the  microcomputer-based laboratories
              developed by Thorton and Laws and  a video projection system.  This project
              will create mobile units  of computers that will serve different areas and
              functions in  teaching physics and calculus and will augment the 
              "Interdisciplinary, team-teaching Calculus and Physics Project" at  Diablo
              Valley Co lege.  This project will improve calculus and  physics instruction,
              increase science literacy, and stimulate other  colleges to adapt this
              approach.
