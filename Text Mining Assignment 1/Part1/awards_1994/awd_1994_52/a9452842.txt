Abstract    :
              9452842  Wagner       The Maps and Aerial Photographic Systems (MAPS) curriculum
              is based on a resource package developed in South Carolina to provide middle
              school students with instructional materials and related cartographic products
              to investigate the interrelationships among geology, land use, history,
              cultural diversity and environmental concerns.  The South Carolina model is
              broadened to include the Southeast and the materials reflect the emphases of
              the current national curriculum initiatives and standards in science and
              geography.  The materials use infrared aerial photographs, Landsat satellite
              images, state-based maps, topographic maps and soil maps as technological
              resources to help study human and geological history.  The student activities
              and resources are keyed to 15 local study sites representing characteristic
              landscapes typical of the seven five major landform regions in the Southeast. 
              The project educates teachers to use the materials and provides opportunities
              for potential al MAPS developers in other states to learn about the curriculum
              and receive training and assistance to customize the materials for   transfer
              to their states.  The materials are disseminated in hard copy and CDROM.
