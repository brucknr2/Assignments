              three-week,  residential, Young Scholars Project in computer science for 30 
              students entering grades 8 and 9. The project will introduce  students to the
              fundamental concepts of computer science. Students  will be provided the
              opportunity to participate in group research  projects, hands-on experience
              with topics such as graphics,  robotics telecommunications, and database.
              Additional experiences  include career awareness activities and field trips to
              various  industrial sites to interact with scientists in their working 
              environment.
