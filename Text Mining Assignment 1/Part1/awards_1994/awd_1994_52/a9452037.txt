Abstract    :
              9452037  McCabe  A programming laboratory for Computer Networks is proposed. 
              Standard Computer Networks texts and curricula have emphasized  general
              concepts ranging from the physical layer to the application  layer, but most
              undergraduate Computer Networks courses fail to  provide experiences of network
              management and program development  in an actual network environment. A basic
              knowledge of Computer  Networks has become a necessary part of the
              undergraduate  curriculum for CS students. Exposure to network concepts is not 
              enough. For most students, network concepts remain abstract and  difficult to
              understand if lecture material is not followed by  laboratory exercises that
              crystallize the concepts. Since standard  network systems are used as an
              environment for intensive network  programming assignments, the resulting
              laboratory manuals are  portable to other universities.
