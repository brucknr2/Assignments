Abstract    :
              9452789  Groat    EarthComm is a three year project developing a complete
              secondary-  level (9-12) educational program in the earth sciences that 
              includes learning materials, teacher resources (both materials and 
              teacher-support networks), and assessment tools for a hands-on,  student
              inquiry-driven, instructional program that is  interdisciplinary and allows
              implementation in a modular format.   There is a strong mentor program included
              to enhance the science  teaching capabilities and leadership skills of
              classroom teachers,  pre-service teachers and post-secondary science educators.
               Goals  of the program are 1) to teach students the principles and  practices
              of earth science and to demonstrate the relevance of  earth science to their
              environment, 2) to integrate earth science  and other academic disciplines
              through the problem-solving, issue-  based model in which the teacher plays the
              role of facilitator, 3)  to establish an expanded learning environment which
              incorporates  field work, technological access to data, and traditional 
              laboratory and classroom activities, 4) to support the development  of
              communities of science learners by establishing student teams  and by building
              a greater regional and national community through  telecommunication access,
              and 5) to utilize local and regional  issues to stimulate problem-solving
              activities and to foster a  sense of environmental stewardship by students in
              their  communities.
