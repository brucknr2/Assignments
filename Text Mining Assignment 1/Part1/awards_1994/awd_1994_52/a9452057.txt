Abstract    :
              9452057  Onasch  This project seeks to combine multimedia technology with 
              cooperative learning in the classroom.  This combination increases  subject
              matter appeal to the students, more clearly demonstrates  concepts, allows
              exploration of the subject matter beyond the time  limitations of
              laboratory/class sessions, and allows flexibility to  accommodate different
              students' different learning styles. The  project focuses on Chemistry and the
              Life Sciences.  For Chemistry,  the multimedia technology allows improved
              molecular modeling, the  ability to "slow down" chemical reactions, the
              simulation of  equipment and/or experiments that are impractical at the lab
              bench,  provides students a qualitative "standard" against which to compare 
              lab bench results, increases safety and facilitates group  discussion.  In the
              Life Sciences, the equipment is being used for  such varied purposes as
              demonstrating concepts/experiments such as  ameboid motion or bacterial
              motility, photosynthesis, dissections,  time lapsing experiments, simulation of
              lung function, heart  attacks, etc.  The equipment is mobile; enough equipment
              stations  have been provided so that students can be divided into small teams 
              to conduct experiments, participate in group discussions, etc.  The  mobility
              also allows the equipment (in a supervised setting) to be  available for
              student use after class hours.
