Abstract    :
              An enhancement of an advanced laboratory course in modern physics  for physics
              majors is proposed.  The specific goal is to offer new  experiments closely
              related to present-day research and  applications in the areas of atomic
              physics and condensed matter,  in response to a projected increase of students
              with interests in  applied and engineering physics.  The project introduces to
              the  laboratory two new experiments: one using a solid state diode laser  to do
              optical pumping and spectroscopy of atoms in an atomic beam  and a second
              experiment involving measurements on a high Tc  superconductor.  The laser
              spectroscopy is combined with a  Stern-Gerlach experiment to yield a rich
              variety of atomic physics  effects which would be accessible to the
              undergraduate student.  In  addition to the Stern-Gerlach effect, the
              experiment allows  demonstrations of: Doppler-free optical spectroscopy,
              hyperfine  structure, optical pumping, radio frequency resonance, and Zeeman 
              effect.  The experiment on a high Tc superconductor involves   measurements of
              the persistent current.
