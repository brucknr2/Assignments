Abstract    :
              A novel printed-circuit antenna is described which has the potential of
              drastically reducing the cost of microwave antennas. Use of printed-circuit
              dipole antenna arrays is not new, however existing methods require complex and
              precise interconnecting transmission lines. The antenna comprises a guided wave
              substrate that is coupled, by proximity, to dipole elements. The structure is
              relatively thin in cross-section, and readily adaptable to many different
              antenna applications. It does not require any protrusions, such as the
              feed-horn needed with parabolic dishes. The radiation patterns may be of
              essentially arbitrary form. Bandwidth and aperture efficiency of the antenna is
              essentially identical to any traveling-wave structure; such as planar waveguide
              slotted arrays. These waveguide array antennas, although expensive to
              manufacture, represent state-of-the-art electrical performance and are used in
              many applications. An example is the F16 aircraft multi-mode radar. The
              proposed antenna is electrically analogous, the difference being in the
              excitation mode. Experimental results are given which confirm the electrical
              efficiency and directionality properties of the antenna.
