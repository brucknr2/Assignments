Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is focused on the
              development of a low-cost on-line sensor for rapid on-site analysis to measure
              trace metallic contaminants in process chemicals commonly used in semiconductor
              manufacturing. Detection and quantitation of trace heavy metal contamination in
              MOS integrated circuit fabrication is of great importance becoming even more
              critical as device geometries are scaled. At present, all such analyses are
              carried out off-line, involving sampling of process fluids and analysis using
              costly laboratory equipment, remote from the fab line. This approach causes
              lengthy and costly delays making on-line or at least `in-fab` methods extremely
              desirable. ChemTrace Corporation proposes to apply a novel anodic stripping
              voltammetry system to provide a low cost, on-line solution to this problem.
              Their approach involves a micromachined iridium microelectrode array on silicon
              and a single-chip, full-featured potentiostat which (when combined with a
              low-cost microcontroller chip) can be directly interfaced to a personal
              computer's serial port. This approach will reduce analysis latencies from many
              hours to minutes and provide unprecedented flexibility and early warning
              capability for contamination.
