Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a process
              to produce SiC multifilament fiber to sell at less than $50/lb. U.S. industry
              has a critical need for composite materials that require an economical
              ceramic/silicon carbide (SiC) fiber to produce the composite. World supply of
              ceramic fibers and particularly SiC is dominated by Japan whose price is in
              excess of $300/lb. Many industrial, aerospace and defense applications are
              impeded by the high cost of SiC fibers, fiber property limitations and foreign
              supply. Advanced innovative manufacturing processing offers the potential to
              produce a superior high quality small diameter multifilament SiC fiber for less
              than one sixth the current price. This program will develop nontraditional
              unique chemical vapor deposition (CVD) processing for the production
              demonstration of multifilament SiC fiber, establish that mechanical properties
              exceed existing SiC fibers and utilize operational data to demonstrate the
              lowest cost of all ceramic fibers.
