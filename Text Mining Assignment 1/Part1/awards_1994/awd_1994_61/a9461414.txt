Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will improve the energy
              efficiency of both air conditioners and refrigerator units with equal or lower
              capital cost. Air conditioners operate on thermodynamic cycle to pump heat from
              a low temperature to a higher temperature where it is rejected o the
              environment. Heat is transferred from air at a high temperature (e.g., 77ÝF)
              cooling it to a lower temperature (e.g., 55ÝF). Even though the heat removal is
              non-isothermally, the evaporator of the conventional vapor compression cycle
              operates isothermally at a single, lower temperature (e.g., 45 Ý F) .
              Thermodynamics predict that if some of the heat were transferred to the
              refrigerant at a higher temperature, then the work of the cycle would be
              reduced. Non-Azeotropic Refrigerant Mixtures (NARMs) are being developed to
              transfer heat non-isothermally thereby reducing power, but NARMs have problems,
              particularly in small scale systems.  TDA Research, Inc. (TDA) modified the
              conventional vapor compression air conditioner slightly to evaporate a single,
              non-ozone depleting refrigerant (HFC-134a) at two temperatures (45ÝF and 55ÝF).
              The new cycle operates with only one mechanical compressor with its inlet at
              the pressure of the higher temperature evaporator. The vapor leaving the 45ÝF
              evaporator is compressed to the higher pressure using fluid power normally
              wasted in a conventional cycle. They anticipate a 18% improvement in the
              Coefficient of Performance (COP) with a 20% increase in the cooling capacity of
              the same compressor In Phase I they will measure the performance of the fluid
              power recovery device and compare life cycle cost of their system to the
              conventional cycle.
