Abstract    :
              Combustion chemical vapor deposition (CCVD(SM)), which was invented by the
              principal investigator, is a high quality film deposition technique that can
              inexpensively and quickly apply various materials in a continuous manner. This
              technology can be used for the production of functionally gradient materials.
              The CCVD method is low cost, high quality and versatile. It does not require a
              reaction chamber or furnace, yet the thin films produced are comparable in
              quality to CVD films, and CCVD technology allows substrates to be passed
              through a deposition zone for production line or large area coatings. Also,
              composition changes are easily made. CCVD, Inc., has produced CVD quality films
              of numerous materials, with an emphasis on YSZ, in the open atmosphere without
              a furnace or reaction chamber. The functionally gradient material (FGM) system
              with good abrasion, heat and corrosion resistance has a novel thin film as the
              exterior coating. Films of the FGM system components will be grown separately
              using CCVD, and the stoichiometry, morphology, microstructure, and physical
              properties of the films will be determined as a function of deposition
              conditions. The FGM coating will then be created by combining the CCVD
              techniques just perfected and tested for wear resistance.
