Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project describes a unique way
              to produce adherent, improved thermal shock resistance coatings on SiC-SiC
              composites. Silicon carbide is being evaluated for industrial heat exchanger
              applications. High temperature use of SiC ceramics in corrosion environments is
              limited to about 1200ÝC in heat exchanger applications. Several attempts were
              made to apply a protective alumina external layer over the SiC substrate.
              Thermal mismatch between alunina and SiC made it impossible to obtain adherent
              alumina coatings on SiC substrate. Providing strong-adherent whiskers are
              growing-off the substrate, the subsequent deposition of alumina coatings will
              result in a formation of adherent, increased toughness, and thermal shock
              resistant alumina coating. Thermomechanical properties of the SiC-reinforced
              alumina coating will be dependent on the whiskers as well as alumina coating
              properties. Tailoring of whiskers properties and coating microstructure will be
              performed in order to obtain adherent alumina coatings on SiC substrates,
              capable of surviving thermal cycling up to 1400ÝC.
