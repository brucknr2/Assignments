Abstract    :
              9461060  Schecht    Nonlinear optical materials are being used for an ever
              widening array of applications. As optical elements for optical communications,
              optical information processing and integrated optics decrease in size, ways
              must be found to develop nonlinear elements of miniature size as well.  This
              program investigates the growth of BetaBaB204 in fiber form. Lasergenics
              Corporation has license to the patents held by Stanford University to the
              laser-heated pedestal-growth technique that is used in the growth of single
              crystal fibers of this new and interesting nonlinear material.    This material
              is particularly interesting for frequency doubling the output of semiconductor
              diode lasers and the Nd:YAG laser.  The research will investigate the effects
              of composition, temperature, pressure, atmosphere and pull-rate on fiber
              growth.  Resulting fibers will be tested for composition, optical quality, and
              uniformity.  Initial tests for second harmonic generation will be done.  Phase
              II is expected to optimize the growth of this material and to build second
              harmonic devices and frequency-double laser diode arrays.  A tunable fiber
              laser system based on fibers of titanium doped sapphire will also be explored.
