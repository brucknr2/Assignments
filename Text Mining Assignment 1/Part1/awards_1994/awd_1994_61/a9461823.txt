Abstract    :
              Heavy metal contamination is quickly becoming a major threat to our quality of
              life. Heavy metal analysis has consequently become a necessary procedure in
              field settings, remote from the well-equipped laboratory, for example in
              environmental cleanup efforts or in screening children for lead poisoning in
              public health clinics. Currently most heavy metal determinations are made by
              graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy (GFAA) or anodic stripping
              voltammetry (ASV). At present, however, the application of GFAA and ASV to
              metal analysis is largely limited to bench-top laboratory settings, carried out
              under the supervision of skilled professionals. ANDCARE proposes the
              development of a rugged, disposable, ASV electrode; ideal for use in the field
              and the small-laboratory. ANDCARE will utilize a new approach: screen printing
              methods combined with spotting, air spray, or electrodeposition of colloidal
              gold for the cost-effective production of single-use ASV electrodes with
              reproducible operational characteristics. The expected result of this Phase I
              project is to demonstrate high performance, printed, single-use ASV electrodes
              for the analysis of trace heavy metals
