Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will provide new
              technology to build practical calorimeters for industrial applications.
              Calorimetry has long been a powerful tool in biological research. Applications
              have been developed that solve a host of analytical and production problems in
              many industries, such as pharmaceuticals, food processing, waste treatment,
              environmental monitoring, agriculture, and biotechnology. However, these have
              not been widely applied because of the lack of affordable instrumentation with
              high throughput and sample containers suitable for measuring biological
              samples. The single most important missing element in the design of such a
              calorimeter is a sensitive, inexpensive heat flux sensor having an output
              signal large enough to be measured by standard circuitry. Thermalytics, Inc.,
              proposes to design and test a unique thermopile sensor which would fill this
              need, and to use it to construct a multiple cell isothermal calorimeter
              prototype. This proposed Phase I effort will also incorporate other innovative
              design elements which will demonstrate the feasibility of producing relatively
              low-cost calorimeters suitable for processing large numbers of industrial
              biological samples. The technology to be developed could be also applied to
              other types of calorimeters, and the integrated circuit sensor may prove useful
              in other types of heat flux measurements.
