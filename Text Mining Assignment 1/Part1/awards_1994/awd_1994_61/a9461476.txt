Abstract    :
                The SBIR Phase I project will develop a technology for producing focused cold
              neutron beams from radioisotopic sources which can be used for neutron
              absorption analysis.  Analytical uses of neutron absorption techniques such as
              prompt-gamma activation analysis (PGAA) and neutron depth profiling (NDP) have
              increased greatly on account of their ability to detect nondestructively many
              light elements that are virtually impossible to detect by other techniques. 
              However, most potential users cannot take advantage of these methods because of
              the techniques traditionally require a reactor as a source of neutrons.  In
              this project new developed capillary optics technology will be used in
              conjunction with a californium-252 source to deliver a focused cold neutron
              beam which is essentially free of gamma rays and higher energy neutrons.  The
              use of cold neutrons to obtain increased reaction cross section and the
              reduction in background will improve sensitivity so neutron absorption
              techniques can be widely used with non-reactor-based neutron sources.
