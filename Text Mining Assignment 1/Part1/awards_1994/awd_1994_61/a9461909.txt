Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes research
              necessary to create an interactive, exploratory software environment for
              detecting and modeling change points. The problem of detecting and modeling
              change points is faced in many contexts in which more than one model is needed
              to describe the data. For example, health variables describing a patient may
              change drastically after heart surgery. The challenge is to detect change
              points, and to characterize the nature of the change. Phase I research will
              focus on (1) algorithms for robust methods, (2) interactive, dynamic graphics,
              (3) the state space approach to modeling seasonal data which contains change
              points, and (4) investigating the MTD model in which it is not necessary to
              specify in advance the presence of change points. Phase II will expand upon
              Phase I work, investigate methods for a broader set of problems, and develop a
              prototype implementation. Phase III will develop a final commercial product,
              implemented in the modern statistical package S-PLUS. This important set of
              modern statistical tools will enable applied statisticians, scientists,
              engineers, and other data analysts to fit more realistic models, and thereby
              realize the greatest return on their investment of collecting data. Such tools
              will help speed technological innovation, and make scientific research more
              efficient.
