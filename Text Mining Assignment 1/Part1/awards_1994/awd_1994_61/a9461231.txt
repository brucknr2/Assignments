Abstract    :
              An opportunity is presented to investigate the feasibility of producing compact
              X-ray sterilizers that could be located in infectious waste producing centers
              where the daily production of medical waste is of the order of (10 kg.
              Potentially infectious medical waste would be converted into ordinary dry
              garbage which, following compaction, could be safely and locally disposed of as
              ordinary trash. These units would accept up to about half cubic foot of
              compacted or non-compacted medical waste. They would produce sterilization
              using irradiation by 1 MeV Bremsstrahlung radiation at the 1.5 to 2.0 MRad
              level in a period of about 4 hours to overnight. The present design concept of
              such units indicates that they promise to be as small as a household
              refrigerator. The product also promises to be reliable and sufficiently
              inexpensive such that, when produced in large numbers, they can be economically
              rented or sold.
