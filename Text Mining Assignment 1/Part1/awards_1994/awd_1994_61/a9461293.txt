Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will investigate the
              feasibility of developing a novel three-dimensional seismic imaging method. The
              novel algorithm is based on a new formulation of the dip moveout (DMO)
              correction. Unlike the DMO correction which is formulated for constant velocity
              media, the new method called migration to zero-offset (MZO) is valid for
              variable velocity media. This new and innovative algorithm will produce images
              of three-dimensional structures while being computationally less expensive than
              prestack migration. The end result of this research effort is an algorithm that
              enables better imaging of geologic structures, and improved reservoir
              characterization. The technique allows for greater accuracy in delineating oil
              field geological structures which in turn reduces development cost and
              increases the amount of hydrocarbons recovered in the existing oil fields.
