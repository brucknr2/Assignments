Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project proposes to investigate
              the fabrication of high-efficiency Si-based visible light emitting diodes
              (LEDs). These LEDs will be built using Spire's recently discovered method for
              making efficient contacts to porous silicon by in-situ electropolymerization.
              In this method, the contact layer is deposited on the entire sponge-like
              surface of porous silicon in the same hydrofluoric (HF) acid solution used to
              anodize Si-substrates and form porous layers. By in-situ deposition, the active
              and fragile Si nanostructures are never exposed to air and, therefore, are not
              oxidized before contact formation. This clean, simple, and low-cost process for
              conductive contact formation can effectively eliminate the most serious problem
              currently preventing the fabrication of an efficient solid-state
              electroluminescent device based on porous silicon. In Phase I, we will
              investigate fabrication of two different types of junction LEDs based on
              in-situ electropolymerized coating of porous silicon. In one device, a
              heterojunction LED will be formed between an electropolymerized p-type layer
              and n-type porous silicon film. The second device will consist of a
              homojunction PN silicon structure with an electropolymerized ohmic contact on
              top. Phase II will optimize the parameters for fabrication of these LEDs and
              demonstrate working prototypes worthy of commercialization.
