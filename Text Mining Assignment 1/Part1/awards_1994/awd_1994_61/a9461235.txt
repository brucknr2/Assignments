Abstract    :
                                            ABSTRACT  9461235  Curlander  Under this proposal,
              a UNIX workstation-based software package will  be developed which is capable
              of automatically deriving surface  topography from a Radarsat SAR stereo pairs
              and data. The software  system will be capable of using available ground
              control  information to refine the platform position and velocity, and thus 
              the accuracy of the derived DEM (digital elevation maps). The  system will
              feature a robust quality assurance subsystem to  minimize errors in the DEM,
              and it will be capable of   orthorectifying the source images using the derived
              DEM.  ***
