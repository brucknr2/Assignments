Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the need for
              advanced packaging techniques in optoelectronic (OE) product manufacturing. The
              limitations in communication and computation today arise from the use of
              centralized, serial architectures. The future in communication and computation
              networks is to move away from systems which are centralized and serial to ones
              that are distributed and parallel. Using electrical signals for high-bandwidth
              parallel I/O and processors suffers from several limitations: (1) expense and
              bulk of shield cables; (2) high attenuation; (3) crosstalk; (4) timing skew;
              and (5) ground loops. Consequently, the demand is for full access to optical
              bandwidths for parallel optical and hybrid processors and parallel fiber links.
              Currently, one barrier to the development of optoelectronic (OE) components and
              systems is the cost. Packaging comprises 40-50% of the OE component cost.
              Today, custom packaging is the rule and not the exception for OE components.
              The need for flexible, standardized, low-cost packaging techniques is
              tremendous. Photonics Research Incorporated proposes to develop advanced
              packaging techniques for OE components and systems.
