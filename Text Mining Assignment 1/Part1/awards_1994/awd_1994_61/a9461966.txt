Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project Spire proposes to
              develop zinc gallate (ZnGa2O4) as a thin-film host phosphor, and produce full
              color (red, green, blue) faceplates by selective ion implantation of recognized
              luminescent centers for this material, viz., Cr, Mn, Ga. Field emission
              displays (FEDs) based on cathodoluminescent (CL) phosphors are rapidly becoming
              the favorite embodiment for flat panel displays in America, and many efforts
              are underway to bring FEDs into the marketplace. However, due to their granular
              nature and limited operating lifetime, conventional sulfide-based powder
              phosphors compromise FED performance. Replacing powdered phosphors with
              sulfur-free, thin film oxide materials produced by physical vapor deposition
              can improve chromaticity, allow much finer definition, and reduce phosphor
              degradation while aiding in process automation to allow control of
              manufacturing costs. In parallel ARPA sponsored programs, Spire has used ion
              implantation in phosphors to demonstrate 50 fL (60 Hz) yellow with ZnS:Mn and 1
              fL (60 Hz) blue with CaGa2S4:Ce for thin film electroluminescence; and 15 fL (1
              mA/cm2) green with Zn2SiO4:Mn for thin film cathodoluminescence, all
              state-of-the-art brightness levels. The proposed program will demonstrate all
              three colors in adjacent lines on a single FED faceplate. Phase II will
              optimize phosphor chemistry and improve external efficiency by studying various
              texturing approaches to minimize waveguiding.
