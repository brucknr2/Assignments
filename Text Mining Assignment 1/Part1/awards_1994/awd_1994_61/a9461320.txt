Abstract    :
                This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will provide the
              National Science Foundation with the design, analysis and key components of a
              particle detector.  This innovative particle detector will use a new
              scintillator material, BaCl2, whose principal decay component is extremely fast
              (efold time about one nanosec, brightness excess BGO).  The PHI team will apply
              this new scintillator as a thin film over a commercially available plastic
              scintillator channel plate (holes 100 microns or more).  PHI will use the
              combined scintillator sandwich as a detector to separate alpha and beta
              particle radiation.  Our team will use the scintillator package with
              commercially available silicon position sensitive detectors and
              photomultipliers to measure both the energy and spatial location of the
              incoming particles.  The proposed detector has a high efficiency and is
              resistant to radiation damage.  The unique time of flight technique proposed
              for PHI particle detector provides both excellent energy resolution and good
              spatial resolution.  The PHI team will demonstrate crystalline BaCl2 and
              plastic sandwich during Phase I.  OCA Applied Optics, the Lawrence Berkeley
              Laboratory (LBL), and the Universities of Southwest Louisiana and Arizona will
              work collaboratively to move this project forward.
