Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project deals with the
              development of a new type of  biocatalysts by crystallization of enzymes on
              solid supports. Enzyme-catalyzed processes offer  significant advantages over
              traditional chemical methods in organic syntheses, including superior 
              efficiency, stereoselectivity and specificity. Yet, despite this enormous
              potential of enzymatic  catalysis only a tiny portion of enzymes is used in the
              synthesis of fine chemicals or pharmaceuticals  on an industrial scale. There
              are three major problems that preclude wider acceptance of enzymes as 
              practical catalysts: enzymes are not stable enough, enzymes are fairly
              expensive, and in some cases -  and this is especially important for the chiral
              resolutions- enzymes stereoselectivity is not high  enough. Altus Biologics,
              Inc. believes that all these problems can be successfully addressed by using 
              Cross-Linked Enzyme Crystals (CLECs). So far CLECs (microcrystals of 1-100 (m)
              have demonstrated  excellent performance characteristics in the synthesis of
              optically pure compounds on a lab scale.  Further scale-up of chemical
              processes (1-1000 kg) will require larger catalyst particles ( 1mm)  which will
              be mechanically stable in both stir-tank and column reactors. To solve these
              problems researchers propose to design new catalysts by crystallization of
              enzymes onto solid supports with the following chemical crosslinking of the
              crystals. CLECs deposited onto solid surfaces (CLEC-SS) will offer significant
              advantages in the large-scale chemical processing.  In this Phase I study,
              candida rugosa lipase (CRL) will be crystallized on the surface of glass beads
              and the properties of the catalyst will be thoroughly investigated.
