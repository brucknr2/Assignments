Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to identify and
              eliminate the sources of defect formation in a novel graphitic fiber called
              Vapor Grown Carbon Fiber (VGCF). VGCF possesses engineering properties that
              equal or greatly exceed other types of carbon fiber, as well as metals.
              Additionally, VGCF can be produced in a simple, rapid and inexpensive chemical
              vapor deposition (CVD) process, thus holding potential to greatly reduce the
              cost of high performance carbon fiber reinforcements. However, the usefulness
              of VGCF is currently limited by batch-mode production which yields a large
              variation in physical properties both within the batch, as well as between
              batches. Consequently, the fibers are not sufficiently predictable to commit to
              critical engineering applications. The proposed research effort will seek to
              identify the source of variations in fiber quality, and to eliminate the
              variations through refinements in the CVD process. Specifically, this effort
              will investigate the relationship between variation in fiber properties and the
              occurrence of a particular morphological feature of the fibers called
              crenulations, and then determine those process variables whose careful control
              will best narrow the range of values of the fiber properties. Optimization of
              these variables and development of techniques to better control them,
              especially during higher volume production, will be the intended focus of the
              associated Phase II effort.
