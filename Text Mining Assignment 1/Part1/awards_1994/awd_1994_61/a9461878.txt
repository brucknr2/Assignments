Abstract    :
              There is currently an active interest in the development of improved methods to
              decontaminate and disinfect waste water. Direct electron beam irradiation is
              attractive since radical formation and attack on contaminants is energy
              efficient and relatively nonselective. Effective decontamination has been
              demonstrated with an energy investment well below 1.0 MRads. Although various
              electron accelerators have been applied, large scale implementation has been
              impeded by excessive size, initial cost, reliability, or scaleability.
              Induction accelerator technology as developed at Science Research Laboratory
              (SRL) offers the promise to surmount these limitations. The objective of this
              effort is to develop a new, low cost and reliable process for decontamination
              of process and wastewater using linear induction accelerator technology.
              Electron beams are produced with the SRL accelerator in a compact configuration
              which employs the reliability of all-solid-state switching to provide high
              average power through high pulse rate. Preliminary tests at SRL at 1.2 MeV
              electron energy have shown effective and efficient destruction of organic
              contaminants in water. The proposed Phase I work will expand these data to a
              wider range (1-1000 ppm) in initial concentrations, and a wider range (0.05-6.0
              MRads) in dosage to provide a basis for system conceptual design, optimization
              and costing. In addition, since peak dose rate for induction accelerators is
              higher (100-1000 times) than rates delivered by electrostatic accelerators,
              this parameter will be varied to seek potential further improvement in system
              efficiency. The existing SNOMAD-IV induction accelerator at SRL with recent
              upgrade to 1.5 MeV will be used in this effort. This system has been coupled to
              a flowing contaminated water system to provide a unique facility for the
              proposed research.
