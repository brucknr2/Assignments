Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is for development of a
              passive multispectral imaging system for remote assessment of pelagic fish and
              marine mammal stocks. The conservation, management, and rational utilization of
              fisheries is becoming an urgent and increasingly challenging problem.
              Currently, assessment of pelagic fish stocks are conducted through human visual
              observations from aircraft to locate schools of fish, determine their species
              and estimate their biomass. These methods are too imprecise and inadequate due
              to variability in observer's bias, perceptions and interpretations, and lack an
              objective permanent record that can be subjected to quantitative analysis. This
              proposal addresses the need for novel instrumentation and methods to acquire
              accurate quantitative data on pelagic fish stocks and habitat resources. The
              objective of the Phase I project is to build a breadboard prototype of the
              remote imaging spectrometer and to evaluate it for its ability to remotely
              detect and identify selected species in the laboratory (marine seaquarium).
