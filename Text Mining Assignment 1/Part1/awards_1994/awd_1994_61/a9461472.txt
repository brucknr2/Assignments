Abstract    :
              Crosstalk and noise in optical communications system transmitters, channels,
              amplifiers and receivers limit system performance and reliability.
              Optoelectronic Data Systems, Inc., investigates the feasibility of differential
              signaling to alleviate these problems by pre-compensating for channel
              non-idealities. The first objective is to analyze and simulate the benefits of
              differential signaling in fiber-optic telecommunications, optical amplifiers,
              optical memories and optical crossbar switches. The benefits include longer
              bandwidth-distance products, higher channel density, lower switching energy,
              lower BER, and longer MTBF. In addition, they perform two experiments that
              demonstrate the potential benefits and validate their theoretical predictions:
              one on integrated differential optoelectronic detector/amplifiers; the other on
              semiconductor optical amplifiers.
