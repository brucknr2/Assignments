Abstract    :
              The goal of this program is to develop a compact, low cost accelerator mass
              spectrometry (AMS) system dedicated to measuring ultra-low quantities of
              carbon-14 and tritium in labeled biological samples. The instrument will have a
              sensitivity 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than that of liquid scintillation
              decay counters and will allow the measurement of carbon-14 concentrations at or
              below naturally occurring levels in modern samples. The labeling of
              biologically active molecules with carbon-14 and/or tritium is a powerful and
              widely used technique for the study of molecular kinetics. The high sensitivity
              afforded by AMS allows the fate of environmental carcinogens, mutagens and
              toxins to be studied on the molecular level at extremely low levels of
              exposure. Existing AMS systems utilize large, expensive tandem accelerators and
              are generally not available to the biologists and biomedical researchers.
              Newton Scientific, Incorporated (NSI) proposes to develop an innovative low
              energy AMS instrument designed specifically for operation in a biological
              research laboratory. In the proposed Phase 1 effort, NSI will evaluate and
              optimize the performance capabilities of a low energy AMS system for biological
              samples and develop a system engineering design for construction and testing in
              Phase 2. The availability of this instrument will greatly expand the number and
              type of biological studies which can be conducted using l4C and tritium
              radiolabels.
