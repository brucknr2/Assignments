Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will show that adaptive
              optics can make a major contribution to ground based optical and infrared
              astronomy by making it affordable. Astronomers have been increasing the size of
              telescopes for years in an effort to increase both resolution and light
              collection capabilities. This approach is limited due to Earth's atmosphere
              degrading the image at seeing time. As apertures increase larger than the
              seeing cells in the atmosphere, improved resolution is lost. Adaptive optics
              can remove most of the degradation. AO systems developed for military
              applications are not practical for astronomical use due to high cost and
              brightness of the reference object needed. One key component to any AO system
              is the deformable mirror which can remove atmospheric wavefront errors.
              Military contractors sell deformable mirrors at costs over $100,000.
              Valpey-Fisher Corporation believes these mirrors made in bimorph form can be
              produced for under $10,000. They will work in collaboration with J. Elon Graves
              and his adaptive optics group at the University of Hawaii. Their experience in
              machining and polishing PZT materials will allow them to produce these mirrors.
