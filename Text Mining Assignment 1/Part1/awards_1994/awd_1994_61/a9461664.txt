Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to investigate
              a new imaging technique which involves dynamic control of the tilt of the
              camera sensor plane. The proposed effort will investigate algorithms using this
              geometry with two objectives. The first objective is to acquire the range map
              of a scene. This is useful to construct geometric models of objects, which are
              in turn useful for navigation, recognition and manipulation. Second, the
              imaging technique delivers a focused photograph of multiple objects. This is
              useful for photography because a larger part of the scene can be included in
              the foreground than possible with normal cameras. Traditionally, range sensing
              requires the use of an energy scan, such as using laser and range measurement
              from returned energy. Both of these methods involve special purpose
              illumination of the scene. The proposed work is aimed at fast acquisition of
              geometric models in natural lighting. Imaging of surfaces that have large
              variations in depth are not traditionally possible, so the proposed work has
              the potential of introducing new photographic capabilities. The proposed
              imaging geometry and algorithms exploit optics of image formation in place of
              mechanical control to achieve both objectives simultaneously.
