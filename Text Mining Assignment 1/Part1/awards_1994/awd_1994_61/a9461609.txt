Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is directed toward the
              development and validation of a comprehensive computational model for chemical
              vapor infiltration (CVI). It involves a macro model that describes the
              transport processes in a porous preform. The macroscopic properties of the
              preform that are needed in the macro model are determined from a micro model in
              which detailed calculations are made for fluid flow, heat transfer, and mass
              transfer in a generalized unit cell comprising of fibers of rectangular cross
              section. The technical objectives of the Phase I effort will be to demonstrate
              the validity of the crucial ingredients of the model for two-dimensional
              infiltration process. The specific topics to be considered are: (a) validation
              of the equivalent unit cell approach, (b) evaluation of preform properties as
              functions of the density, (c) validation of the overall model for a
              two-dimensional preform by demonstrating that the results of the proposed model
              compare well with those obtained from full numerical simulation that accounts
              for all geometric details, and (d) a case study to demonstrate the usefulness
              of the proposed model as a design/optimization tool. Use of the proposed
              computational model will lead to lower manufacturing cost and increased use of
              ceramic composite materials.
