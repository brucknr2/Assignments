Abstract    :
              This Phase I Small Business Research Innovation Project focuses on the
              development of a state of the art parameter estimation code. Many phenomena in
              science and engineering are described by systems of ordinary linear
              differential equations (ODEs). Often, although it is possible to write out the
              equations which govern the system, the coefficients or parameters which
              describe the rate of the various processes are unknown. If the researcher has
              data describing the operation of the system, these parameters can be determined
              from the data. This process is called parameter estimation. Parameter
              estimation problems are common in many areas, including chemical kinetics and
              thermodynamics, biology, epidemiology and control theory. Unfortunately, not
              only are such problems extremely difficult to solve in practice, but there is
              no robust public domain or commercial code available. Thus, the objective of
              this project is to demonstrate that a method known as `domain decomposition` is
              considerably more robust than the current standard method `the black box
              method`, that the code can be written so that the user does not have to be a
              parameter estimation expert, and that the code can be run on a standard PC.
