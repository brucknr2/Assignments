Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project investigates the
              performance and feasibility of a channel-hopping packet radio-base station. In
              the United States, a consortium of cellular service providers is building a
              nationwide mobile data network called Cellular Digital Packet Data (CDPD). By
              using existing 30 kHz radio frequency channels, CDPD provides a mobile data
              overlay on the existing cellular voice system. To exploit unused capacity, CDPD
              hops between idle voice channels. Base stations currently under development
              scan the available frequencies and select the idle channel that is expected to
              remain idle for the maximum length of time. This approach is far from optimal
              because it does not address co-channel interference effects. To improve
              throughput of hopping data channels, the base station should select the idle
              channel with the least co-channel interference. By doing so, a packet radio
              system can theoretically increase throughput by a factor of five. This project
              presents many technical challenges, including the need for a 12.5 MHz-wide
              digital receiver capable of acquiring and processing channel data in less than
              10 milliseconds. The research objectives of this project are to demonstrate a
              factor of four improvement in throughput in Rayleigh fading, determine
              estimation accuracy, determine the impact of implementation losses, determine
              the performance of multiple hopping channels, and investigate efficient
              spectral estimation techniques.
