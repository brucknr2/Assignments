Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to research ways to
              make mathematics curriculum more accessible to students with physical
              disabilities. Students with disabilities have been neglected in mathematics
              education, primarily because teachers have lacked the technology to make the
              curriculum accessible. Hundreds of thousands of these students could go on to
              use math skills in careers of their choice. But they need math education, just
              like all other students. This is a feasibility study on Multi-Math Adaptations.
              These are math curriculum adaptations that work with multiple math curricula,
              serve people with a multiplicity of disabilities, employ a multisensory
              approach, and use the power of multimedia computing. These adaptations combine
              computer power with hands-on manipulatives and worksheets. Multi-Math
              Adaptations take advantage of award-winning computer hardware and software
              designed specifically for people with disabilities. The Phase I effort will
              involve 1st and 2nd graders, focusing on a prototype unit in Attributes and
              Classification. The research team will study math curriculum used in grades 1-2
              employed across the country and will design a set of prototype curriculum
              adaptations for these curricula. The prototypes will be tested in schools. Data
              will be gathered to determine whether Multi-Math Adaptations can be effective
              for both the students and the teachers. If Phase I verifies feasibility, a
              Phase II will expand to include other units of math study in grades K-5.
