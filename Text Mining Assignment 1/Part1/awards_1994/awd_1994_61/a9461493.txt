Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project identifies information
              requirements in a low  income community that could be supplied with resources
              on the Internet, and develops a prototype  application for supplying those
              requirements. As the development of a National Information  Infrastructure
              progresses, and as greater concern is raised over the issue of universal access
              for all  Americans to the resources of the `information superhighway`, the
              development of vernacular applications tailored to the needs of low income
              communities is a matter of highest national priority.  The prevailing design of
              Internet applications is based upon a middle class style of information access.
              Although `electronic redlining` is a regulatory concern, the question of
              universal access must be answered not only in terms of `access where`, but also
              in terms of `access by whom` and `access for what`.  This study addresses this
              issue by conducting anthropological field research on information resources and
              strategy in a low-income neighborhood of Chicago. Wizdom Systems, Inc. will
              profile the information requirements and acquisition patterns of low-income
              groups; with rapid prototyping methods, they design broadband applications that
              are demonstrably useful and valuable. The Phase I result would be a system
              design and prototype for an Internet application tailored to low-income Black
              communities.
