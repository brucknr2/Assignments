Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project will develop a powerful
              optical diagnostic for high temperature gases that is fundamentally different
              from any technique currently in use. This diagnostic provides spatially
              localized information, like laser-induced fluorescence, but does not require a
              laser. It utilizes the optical emission from the hot luminous gases. As
              explained in this proposal, the emitted light can be optically detected and
              subsequently manipulated and separated into two components whose intensity
              difference is due only to optical emission from a spatially localized region
              within the luminous volume. More precisely, this intensity difference is due to
              one spatial Fourier component of the light source distribution in the selected,
              localized region. Because of prior university and SBIR development of
              low-frequency devices, a high-frequency shearing interferometer emission
              velocimeter (SIEVE) can be designed, fabricated, and demonstrated under SBIR
              funding. In Phase I, three different ways to extend the technique to high
              frequencies will be analyzed, conceptual designs for instruments will be
              developed, and the light intensity requirements for each method will be
              calculated. A complete instrument will be built, demonstrated, and
              characterized during Phase II.
