Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project outlines a program to
              determine the physical origins of the degradation in performance of thin-film
              high-temperature superconductor (HTS) rnicrowave devices with increasing power.
              The most promising application for thin-film HTS is high-frequency signal
              processing. Passive microwave devices such as resonators, filters, and delay
              lines fabricated from YBa2Cu3O7-x (YBCO) thin films and operated at 77K have
              shown dramatically improved performance over conventional materials. However,
              signal power levels transmitted through these devices are on the order of only
              10 milliwatts. Most commercial applications, in particular cellular
              communications, require signal processing with power levels exceeding 10 watts.
              The performance of even the very highest quality thin-film superconductors
              degrades dramatically at only 5 watts of input power! High quality, epitaxial
              YBCO films will be grown by laser ablation with deliberately altered
              microstructural characteristics, such as improved epitaxy, chemical dopants and
              enhanced grain boundaries; then the resulting films will be characterized by
              patterning into microstrip resonators to evaluate their microwave performance
              at 77K. These results will allow the Phase II effort to focus on the most
              promising methods for scale-up and circuit fabrication.
