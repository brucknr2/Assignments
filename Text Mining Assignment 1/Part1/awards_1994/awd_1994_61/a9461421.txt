Abstract    :
              In the crude and #6 oil storage tanks, precipitation of the suspended particles,
              water and other chemicals results in continuous building up of sludge material
              on the tank bottom. Over time the sludge material condenses into a hard asphalt
              like compound. The material contains highly corrosive elements that
              deteriorates the surface preparations and corrodes the tank and seam welds. The
              build-up may reach several feet, reducing tank capacity and creating enormous
              cleaning and inspection problems. The disposal of the hazardous sludge material
              requires great care and is very costly (a major clean-up costs between one half
              and one million dollars). The objective of this SBIR effort is to develop an
              integrated robotic system that entirely eliminates the build-up of the hard
              sludge material and cleans and prepares tank surfaces and welds for in-situ
              inspection. The system can operate in the present tanks without requiring any
              modification. The present safety and sludge material disposal problems are
              eliminated. The Phase I effort involves a detailed technical and economical
              feasibility study of the proposed system. As part of the Phase II effort, a
              working prototype will be constructed and fully tested. Both efforts are
              performed with close collaboration of a local utility company.
