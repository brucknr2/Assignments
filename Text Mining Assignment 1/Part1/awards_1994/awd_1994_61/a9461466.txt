Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is for development of a
              compact, rugged, fiber-optic Raman spectrometer system suitable for performing
              real-time, in vivo, tissue analysis in a clinical setting. Tissue
              characterization by laser-based spectroscopic methods, such as fluorescence and
              Raman spectroscopy is showing significant promise for identification of tissues
              on the basis of chemical composition and for evaluating the health status of
              tissues. Coupled with fiber-optics, these methods offer the extraordinary
              potential of performing tissue chemical analysis in vivo. Before these powerful
              new diagnostic methodologies can be implemented as practical tools in a
              clinical setting, a number of instrumentation problems need to be resolved. In
              particular, current laboratory research instruments must be converted into
              rugged, low-cost, easy-to-use, compact units suitable for deployment in a
              clinical setting and reliable operation by clinical personnel. This proposal
              offers an innovative approach to solving this problem.
