Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will investigate the
              feasibility of developing a biohydrometallurgical process for extracting gold
              and silver from bio-oxidized ore by means of leaching that does not incorporate
              use of cyanide, thiourea, thiosulfate, or other conventional lixiviants. Gold
              and silver mines are often located in pristine environments that are highly
              susceptible to pollution by mining and metals recovery activities. While
              biotechnologies have been developed for freeing precious metals from refractory
              ores, cyanidation is still the process of choice for extracting gold and silver
              values. Whereas the ultimate goal of the research is to develop a heap leach
              process, a simplified working model will be used to study the process during
              Phase I. The working model will comprise a continuous stirred tank reactor
              (CSTR) containing a slurry of ore particles to minimize mass transfer
              limitations. The project includes using mathematical models to infer optimum
              processing conditions, designing an experimental working model of the process,
              fabricating the working model and developing experimental techniques,
              conducting proof-of-concept experiments, and analyzing the data from those
              experiments. A significant change in the basic technology of gold and silver
              extraction is proposed that will reduce mining-associated pollution at its
              source.
