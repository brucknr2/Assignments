Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes research and
              development efforts for a novel environmental electrochemical sensor based on
              unique nonaqueous electrolyte with a three electrode structure in the sensor
              cell. The nonaqueous electrolyte is nontoxic and noncorrosive it has large
              voltage window, low vapor pressure and high solubility for gases and vapors.
              The sensors have the potential for high selectivity, sensitivity, long life and
              multi-gas sensing capability. They can detect and monitor low concentrations of
              toxic gases such as nitrogen dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, and volatile
              organic compounds like trichloroethylene, dichloromethane, tetrachloroethane,
              and carbon tetrachloride whose exposure can affect the health and safety of
              workers. Phase I efforts will investigate the properties of nonaqueous
              electrolyte solutions, using the electrolyte in the cell and scanning
              voltammetry. will conduct experiments on laboratory and prototype cells for the
              detection of toxic gases and vapors and multi-gas sensing capability.
