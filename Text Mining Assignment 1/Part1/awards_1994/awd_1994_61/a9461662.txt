Abstract    :
              This SBIR Phase-I program addresses a crucial, unsolved problem in
              nondestructive evaluation (NDE). Structures as diverse as aircraft, pipelines,
              reaction vessels, bridges, and buildings can develop defects that are hidden
              from view by many millimeters of metal. Such defects include cracks or voids in
              thick structural members, interfacial corrosion in layered structures, and
              cracks radiating from fastener holes in the second or third layer of a lap
              joint. Existing NDE techniques are inadequate for detecting such structural
              problems.  Quantum Magnetics, Inc. propose to develop an improved eddy current
              system that detects deeply buried defects, using low-frequency electromagnetic
              fields that penetrate deeply into the metal. This system will combine two
              recent developments: (1) extremely sensitive magnetoresistive magnetometers,
              and (2) the Three-Sensor Gradiometer (TSG), an elegant noise rejection
              technique originally developed for superconducting SQUID magnetometers. Quantum
              Magnetics is uniquely qualified to develop this new system, because of its
              expertise in measuring the AC magnetic response of small samples and making
              ultrasensitive magnetic measurements in noisy environments.
