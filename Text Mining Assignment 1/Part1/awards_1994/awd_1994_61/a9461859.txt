Abstract    :
               The monolithic ring approach to building powerful, highly-coherent laser
              sources is been well proven at the two wavelengths of 1064 nm and 1319 nm.  The
              commercial market and the thus technological value of this laser design
              increased if more wavelengths were available at  the same high power and
              extreme coherence.  This research explores lasers based on the monolithic ring
              resonator design at a number of wavelengths other than 1064 nm and 1319 nm. 
              These lasers may applications in absolute-distance interferometry, astronomical
              instrumentation  for detection of astronomical millimeter waves, atomic clocks
              and precision metrology using specific near infrared and visible wavelengths.  
              The Phase I objective is to powerful, single-frequency, diode-pumped laser
              oscillation on a number of laser lines that have not yet been used
              commercially.  Two techniques are employed. First, using Nd:YAG, the research
              uses wavelength-selective coatings to get as many wavelengths as possible.
              Second, lasers at two quasi-three level laser lines - Nd:YAG at 946 nm, and
              Yb:YAG at 1030 nm - are constructed by using diffusion-bonding to create
              monolithic resonators with doped and undoped regions.   The range of
              single-frequency laser lines which are available is expected to be expanded. 
              Phase II  will be the design of lasers at wavelengths identified in Phase I.
