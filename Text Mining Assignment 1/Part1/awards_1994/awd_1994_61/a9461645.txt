Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is proposed by American
              Superconductor Corporation (ASC) to establish the feasibility of a novel,
              low-cost process for manufacturing the robust superconducting wires required
              for commercially viable magnet components capable of operating at temperatures
              that are accessible by inexpensive refrigeration technologies.  Most of the
              potentially large-scale commercial applications of high temperature
              superconducting wires in magnet components require high sustained current
              densities at temperatures above 50 K in magnetic fields up to 5 Tesla. The
              proposed process is an innovative combination of the metallic precursor process
              pioneered by ASC and its partners for the economical production of robust high
              temperature superconducting wires, and film processes that produce the highest
              demonstrated critical current densities above 50 K in fields above 5 T. The
              Phase I project will establish the feasibility of a metallic precursor wire
              manufacturing process that employs the texturing processes utilized in thin
              film processes for attaining highly aligned grain microstructures. The inherent
              formability of the metallic precursor alloys presents a unique opportunity for
              manufacturing complex, geometrically precise, chemically homogeneous precursors
              similar locally to those used in thin film processes.
