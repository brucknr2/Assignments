Abstract    :
              Photochemical syntheses and treatment technologies have the potential to replace
              traditional chemical methods which suffer from high environmental cost.
              However, a fundamental problem in the use of light energy for chemical
              processing concerns excitation inhomogeneity. High reaction rates at the
              reactor/light source interface can lead to filming, secondary photolysis, chain
              termination, and low yields. A new type of photochemical reactor, the
              Photo-Spray Reactor, is proposed to provide a major advance in photochemical
              technology. This innovation achieves `walless` excitation, optical homogeneity,
              and excellent mass transfer rates at gas/liquid interfaces. This Phase I
              feasibility program tests a bench-scale Photo-Spray reactor on two processes:
              VUV photodegradation of aqueous pollutants, and cyclo-addition of
              diphenylacetylene to benzothiophene. It will ultimately address the prospects
              of using the Photo-Spray reactor concept for previously unattainable
              photochemical conversions.
