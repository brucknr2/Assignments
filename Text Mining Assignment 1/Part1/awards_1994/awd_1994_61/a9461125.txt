Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project involves the development
              of sensor fusion strategy and algorithm for an advanced copper metallization
              cluster tool for high performance on-chip interconnect. A growing number of low
              cost in-situ sensors are available to measure the various process parameters in
              a single wafer rapid thermal processor. In order to meet the increasingly
              stringent process control requirements for sub-half micron semiconductor
              technologies, development of the physical sensors as well as the ability to
              manage and interpret the increasingly larger number of sensor data are needed.
              The proposed SBIR Phase I project addresses the issue of intelligent
              integration and interpretation of sensor data.   The sensor fusion algorithm
              will be applied to CVC Products' advanced copper metallization cluster tool
              which consists of 4 cluster modules (ICP, collimated PVD, MOCVD, RTP/.RTCVD).
              Sensor fusion technology is a key enabler of the copper metallization
              technology which is expected to play a strategic role in 0.25um semiconductor
              technologies and beyond. The sensor fusion algorithm will be developed based on
              a set of real time and pre/post process sensors that have been developed and
              verified during the Texas Instruments/ARPA/Air Force MMST program.
              Additionally, CVC's proprietary sensors as well as commercially available
              sensors will be used as inputs to the sensor fusion algorithm.
