Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Project will investigate the
              feasibility of a novel modular image processing architecture. The proposed
              system will be designed to be compatible with existing microprocessor
              architectures to allow for commercial product development and market entry in
              the near future. Additional benefits of the system over existing image
              processing methods are increased processing speed, on-chip stereo and motion
              correspondence computation, low power consumption, reduced size (stand-alone or
              MCM packaged chips) and cost. The work involves research in analytical
              foundations, as well as experimentation and simulation with a variety of
              algorithms that can be implemented in hardware. This broad scope of
              investigations will lead to a better understanding of the issues involved in
              the actual construction of an image processor and enhance the level of success
              during Phase II prototype development.
