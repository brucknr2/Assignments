Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will utilize surface
              micromachining techniques to fabricate a low-cost Deformable Mirror (DM).
              Despite steady improvements in performance, current DMs remain prohibitively
              expensive. Present devices continue to cost upwards of one thousand dollars per
              actuator. This is due primarily to manufacturing schemes which rely on
              precision machining or precision assembly of large numbers of components.
              Etalon, Inc. proposes a fabrication process which has already proven the
              potential of reducing costs by at least an order of magnitude. The process
              relies on a novel microfabrication process to fabricate large area deformable
              structures monolithically, i.e., as a single component. Using deposited and
              grown dielectric films, an electrostatically driven membrane mirror can be
              fabricated with great precision and reliability on an optically finished
              substrate. No conventional machining is required, and batch production is
              facilitated. This effort will investigate some of the issues posed by this
              process, perform an elaborate computer simulation using specialized finite
              element analysis software, and evaluate the performance of the proposed
              devices.
