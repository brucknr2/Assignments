Abstract    :
                                          Abstract  9461160  Osterman  This SBIR Phase I
              project is to develop, fabricate and test a new  type of micromachined
              bolometric detector using silicon nitride as  a high strength substrate.  These
              bolometers will be suitable for  mass production so they will be able to be
              assembled into large  arrays for imaging at millimeter wavelengths; whereas,
              currently  bolometers are "hand-made" and so variable from detector to 
              detector that large arrays are nearly impossible to build.  If this 
              development program is successful it will open up the field of high  angular
              resolution millimeter wavelength astronomy, especially at  the South Pole
              observatory.  It is expected that the development of  imaging bolometers will
              lead to a number of applications, possibly  in the medical arena or for space
              surveillance.  ***
