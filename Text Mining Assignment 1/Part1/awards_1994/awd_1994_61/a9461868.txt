Abstract    :
              Programmable Calculators with a computer link are now affordable for individual
              student use. It is possible to design calculator software that transforms these
              calculators into personal computers for every elementary school student to use
              as conveniently as a textbook. Programs can be stored on a computer disk and
              are easily loaded into a class set of calculators to meet individual or class
              lesson needs. The advantages of computer aided instruction are accessible to
              every student for school and home use. Early age student use of this individual
              technology, parent involvement at home and better open ended problem solving
              are now possible. CalcuSoft, Inc. proposes initially to develop calculator
              software for fourth grade mathematics by linking our pilot test in one
              classroom to six more classrooms, funded by this Phase I research project. The
              outcomes will guide development of their product and a Phase II proposal that
              includes applications in science and special education.
