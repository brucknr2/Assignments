Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project covers the development
              of an innovative tool called resonant holographic interferometric spectroscopy
              (RHIS) to address the challenges presented in multi-phase combusting
              environments. The innovation is the development of an instrument capable of
              simultaneously and quantitatively measuring multi-phase components in
              combustion based on revolutionary advances in spectroscopic holographic
              techniques and applications. Implementation of real-time RHIS will allow
              researchers direct access to quantitative imaging of parameters such as the
              species concentrations, gas temperature, and particle distribution and size
              within combusting sprays. Advances in novel photorefractive material enables
              the instantaneous writing and reading of holographically stored spray and flow
              field data, thus eliminating the conventional, tedious process of exposing and
              developing film plates. The relevance is that researchers will have for the
              first time a user-friendly tool that is capable of real-time, nonintrusive,
              quantitative, combusting spray imaging.
