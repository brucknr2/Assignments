Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will address the
              manufacturing process used for proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell
              membrane electrode assemblies (MEA). Current manufacturing techniques for
              production MEAs use large quantities of platinum (up to 4 mg/cm2) and require
              intensive labor to assemble. The various processes yield consistent performance
              among different manufacturers, but all are extremely costly due to high
              material and labor costs.  This effort will explore the methodology and develop
              techniques to deposit low platinum loadings directly on the polymer membrane
              surface using a process similar to that used in laser printers. Objectives
              include demonstrating the feasibility of electrostatic deposition of catalyst
              on a polymer membrane; identifying the optimum conditions (size of particles,
              particle carrier, electrical charge, and pressure/temperature relations) for
              electrostatic deposition; and developing a continuing R&D plan for Phase II.
              The Phase I program will use a modified laser printer to evaluate platinum
              deposition techniques. Various platinum particle sizes and platinum/carrier
              particle mixes will be tested for transfer rates, coverage, electrical
              conductivity, and chemical reactivity. Light and transmission electron
              microscopes will be used to evaluate membrane coverage and conditions following
              platinum deposition.
