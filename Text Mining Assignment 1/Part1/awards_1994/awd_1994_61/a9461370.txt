Abstract    :
              The wavelet transform is an important new tool which has made a huge impact on a
              variety of important problems. For example, wavelets have been successfully
              applied to data compression problems. What makes wavelets good for data
              compression is also what makes wavelets good for statistical estimation.
              Wavelets and associated ideas have the potential to make a huge contribution to
              problems in involving noisy and indirect observations. StatSci Division,
              MathSoft, Inc. proposes to develop a collection of statistical techniques based
              on the principle of wavelet shrinkage. Wavelet shrinkage refers to estimations
              obtained by taking the wavelet transformation, followed by shrinking the
              empirical wavelet coefficients towards zero, followed by inverse
              transformation. These techniques will be bundled in an object-oriented software
              toolkit. The research plan is divided into four components: (1) a wavelet
              shrinkage advisor to help sift through the myriad of techniques, (2) a suite of
              diagnostics and remedies to diagnose and fix common problems, (3) new wavelet
              shrinkage algorithms, (4) new statistical theory behind wavelet shrinkage. The
              tools developed in their research will apply to a wide variety of statistical
              and scientific problems, including signal extraction, nonparametric regression,
              density estimation, inverse problems, image reconstruction and enhancement,
              change-point analysis, and analysis of massive datasets.
