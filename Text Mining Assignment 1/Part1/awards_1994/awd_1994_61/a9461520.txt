Abstract    :
              The proposed SBIR Phase I project will develop a software design tool that will
              be used in advanced materials processing to predict the grain structure of
              materials. This is a very important tool with wide commercial and technical
              value. Grain structure is a primary factor in materials properties and must be
              carefully considered in almost all materials processing applications. The
              advent of easy access to advanced computing power such as engineering
              workstations has made it possible to use computer simulation in engineering
              design. The design of materials through computer simulation is now at hand. The
              proposed research will use a coupled heat flow and Monte Carlo simulation of
              fine grain, superalloy, investment casting to demonstrate the feasibility of
              such an approach to materials processing design. The simulation program will be
              developed from work previously supported by the NSF and reported in the
              literature. Commercialization of the research will seek application to a wide
              range of materials processes where grain structure is of critical importance.
              The successful completion of this project will make US industry more productive
              and competitive in the area of advanced materials processing. A representative
              of the advanced materials processing industry, Howmet Corporation, is
              participating in this project.
