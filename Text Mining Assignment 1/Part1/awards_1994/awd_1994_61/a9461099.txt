Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will study a novel
              specular low magnetic field Giant Magnetoresistive (GMR) composite thin film
              material which uses a GMR sandwich film and two specular reflecting layers at
              the outer boundaries. Currently, in layered GMR materials, high GMR ratio is
              accompanied by a high required driving field. The proposed new GMR material
              will have the relatively large resistance change of a multilayer GMR film and
              yet will require low magnetic driving fields to effect the change, as in GMR
              spin valve films. Candidate electron specular reflecting materials will be
              explored to test their compatibility with sputtered GMR sandwich films.
              Annealing techniques for achieving electron specular reflecting outer
              boundaries will be explored. In Phase I, a prototype material will demonstrate
              the feasibility of the concept. It will show at least a 20% change in
              resistance for an applied field of 10 Oe or less
