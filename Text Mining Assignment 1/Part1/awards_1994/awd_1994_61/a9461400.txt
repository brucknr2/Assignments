Abstract    :
              In cooperation with industrial partner Amerigon, Inc., NeuroDyne, Inc., plans a
              new thrust toward electric and hybrid vehicles. Previous work by NeuroDyne has
              developed methods of identification and intelligent control, using artificial
              neural networks (ANN) which are well adapted to work with vehicle systems. Part
              of this effort (supported by NSF Grant ECS 9216530 `Reducing Pollution and
              Increasing Fuel Economy Using Intelligent Control` through the University of
              South Carolina) resulted in a rational scheme for identifying, with feedforward
              neural networks, a class of nonlinear dynamic systems. The major problem to be
              addressed is to apply the NeuroDyne identification methods to an electric
              energy management system (EMS); the goal of the EMS is to optimize driving
              range by budgeting power demands, while taking into account safety,
              driveability and passenger comfort. An extension of this work is to provide
              ANN-based controls for hybrid automobiles (fuel-burning engine plus batteries)
              taking into account fuel economy, exhaust emissions, and efficiency.
