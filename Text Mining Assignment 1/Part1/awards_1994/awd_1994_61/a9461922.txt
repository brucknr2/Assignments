Abstract    :
              This SBIR Phase I project proposes to investigate an innovative new class of
              materials which can be applied to molten metal filtration. The proposed concept
              utilizes ceramic foams fabricated by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) as a
              porous medium for the filtration of liquid metal. These materials will offer
              dramatically increased strength, modulus, and corrosion resistance as well as
              an increase in the permeability of the foam filter. The development of this
              material will provide a high-strength, high surface area, high-permeability
              refractory filter for use in the aluminum and steel production industries.
              Reticulated refractory foam produced by CVD will provide the aluminum industry
              with a higher strength, finer pore size, greater void fraction filter medium
              than is currently available, and the non-oxide refractory materials desired by
              the steel industry. CVD technology makes possible the production of reticulated
              foams which require only 5-25% solid fraction with 100% open-pore faces, with
              pore sizes as fine as 600 pores per linear inch (ppi), compared to the current
              30%-35% solid fraction of sintered/bonded particle foams which are limited to
              65 ppi. Ultramet will fabricate refractory ceramic foams by CVD and conduct
              evaluations with regard to pore size and material choice. Information on the
              priming head, molten metal permeability, particle capture efficiency, and
              resistance to molten metal corrosion will also be generated.
