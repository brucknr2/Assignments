Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes an innovative
              solution to the design of a power electric drive system capable of operating in
              all four quadrants with maximum efficiency. The controller is insensitive to
              system parameter changes and is stable. The system operates synergistically in
              that each of the major subsystems (motor, inner inverter control loop, outer
              speed control loop) is chosen or designed in such a way that maximum efficiency
              is a constant goal. The proposed solution is a unique combination of a PMBDC
              high efficient motor, an innovative voltage inverter design, and a
              self-organizing fuzzy neurocontroller, each of which acts to maximize some
              aspect of the controller operation while compensating for the disadvantages of
              the rest of the system. The controller described here would be very suitable
              for use in electric or hybrid vehicles. The main technical advance is extending
              the speed range of a PMBDC using a unique inverter design and controlling the
              speed with an unusual self-organizing fuzzy controller.
