Abstract    :
              In providing emergency services, city and county agencies are faced with a
              number of complex logistical challenges. These include determining the
              locational configurations of stations and equipment, establishing dispatching
              policies and routing information, and developing appropriate equipment move-up
              policies. In addressing these challenges, emergency service agencies must
              consider two difficult goals: first, because of the importance of the service,
              it is necessary to position and dispatch vehicles in such a manner that any
              call requiring service may be responded to both promptly and reliably; second,
              because of budget constraints, the service must be provided in the most
              cost-effective manner possible. To assist agencies in addressing these two
              critical needs, ISERA Group proposes to develop a comprehensive Decision
              Support System (DSS) for the design and evaluation of emergency services. The
              DSS will provide simulation strategies for testing existing or proposed station
              and equipment configurations and dispatching and move-up policies. To
              complement such functionality, the proposed DSS will support protocols for
              communication with existing geographical information systems (GIS) and
              computer-aided dispatching (CAD) systems.
