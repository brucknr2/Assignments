Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is designed to develop
              methods to chemically modify small peptide molecules for use primarily in
              non-radioactive, rapid, sensitive chemiluminescent immunoassays. Assay Designs,
              Inc. would like to replace the lengthy, complex radioactive immunoassays for
              small peptides with a rapid assay, reducing the incubation time from several
              days to a few hours. The research project will investigate the possibility of
              attaching chemiluminescent molecules to the N-terminal amino acid of a small
              peptide, and determining the effect of the change on the immunological binding.
              Several approaches are proposed to achieve this derivatization of the peptide.
              Researchers have chosen the neurologically active peptide, vasopressin as a
              suitable trial peptide. Current assay methods require the use of radioactive
              materials in procedures that take several days to complete. The purpose of this
              Phase I research is to test feasibility in chemically modifying vasopressin to
              attach chemiluminescent molecules that allow for rapid sensitive detection. The
              methods used will involve the attachment of chemiluminescent Acridinium esters
              and alkaline phosphatase systems to these small peptides. Researchers will also
              investigate small changes to the peptide sequence in order to allow easier
              introduction of such chemiluminescent molecules and labels. The methods used to
              chemically alter these peptides should be applicable to a large number of
              different small peptide molecules.
