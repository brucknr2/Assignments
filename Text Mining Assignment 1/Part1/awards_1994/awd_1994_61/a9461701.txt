Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I proposal is directed at the pulp
              and paper industry. The use of recycled paper fibers is growing rapidly, yet
              the properties of the pulp created from secondary fibers varies greatly. This
              project addresses the problem by control of the refining process. Since mixed
              secondary paper waste changes continuously as new material is fed into the
              process stream, an on-line control strategy is needed. This program will
              provide critical information on processing versus property relationship and
              will produce a control algorithm for the on-line modification of the refining
              process. Other objectives of the project are the identification of suitable
              sensor technology to provide process data, and the identification of equipment
              that can operate under the potentially harsh conditions.  The research will
              focus on experimental data that will establish the process and property
              relationship of the refining conditions and the resultant secondary paper
              pulps. Recycled pulp will be evaluated for numerous properties both prior to
              and following treatment, in either single or recirculated mode through the
              refiner.  Anticipated results are that the properties of secondary paper pulp
              can be controlled in real-time by the proposed process. Equipment control
              algorithms will be developed that can aid the secondary paper pulp industry in
              improving the strength and consistency of secondary paper fiber pulps.
