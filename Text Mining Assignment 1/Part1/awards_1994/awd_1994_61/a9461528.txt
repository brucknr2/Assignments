Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project provides a valuable
              solution to power limitations of electric vehicles. Electric vehicles (EV)
              powered by fuel cells (FC) have appeal related to their high efficiency, low
              pollution levels and minimum number of moving parts. A major limitation of FC
              is their limited power. Historically oxygen based FC have increased power by
              increasing system pressure and oxygen partial pressure. This pressure process
              consumes significant energy and causes weight and design problems. The major
              limitation in using oxygen enriched air (OEA) from membranes for increasing
              oxygen partial pressure is that no compact OEA systems exists. Our high oxygen
              permeable perfluoropolymer membranes dramatically improve oxygen flux
              capability. They will supply compact OEA (30-35% oxygen) membrane systems for
              enhanced FC power. Engineering studies indicate our perfluoromembrane systems
              are 30 times more productive than existing membranes and can boost power 50%
              with significantly less weight than lead-acid batteries. Phase I focuses on
              proof of concept by developing the needed thin film composite hollow fiber
              structure to demonstrate high flux and doing engineering evaluations on the
              overall system. Phase II will focus on developing expanded area prototype
              membrane modules and running actual FC tests.
