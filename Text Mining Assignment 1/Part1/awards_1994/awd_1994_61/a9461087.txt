Abstract    :
              Multimedia electronic books are now quite common. Electronic technical
              textbooks; however, are not practical or cost-effective to produce. What is
              lacking are the innovative software tools that will allow publishers to produce
              these products without an extensive software development investment. Electronic
              technical textbooks provide boundless potential to enhance the technical
              learning process and to stimulate wider interest in high-technology careers.
              Key to making electronic technical textbooks meet these promises is true
              dynamic interaction. Students must be able to not only visualize physical
              processes through animation, active equations, and graphing, but must be able
              to see the effect of changing parameter values on a physical process. It is
              only by this dynamic interaction that a true understanding of physical,
              electrical, and chemical processes are understood. Current multimedia
              technology does not provide this capability. Applied Research Associates
              proposes to build on their experience in developing electronic multimedia
              technical manuals and develop tools that will allow publishing houses to
              produce electronic textbooks at a cost that is easily recoverable. The unique
              aspects of the proposed software tools are that they: (1) provide linkage
              capability among active objects, a key requirement for technical texts; (2)
              provide dynamic interaction, a key requirement for bonafide improvement of the
              education process; and (3) minimize the need for programmers in the development
              phase, a key requirement for economic viability.
