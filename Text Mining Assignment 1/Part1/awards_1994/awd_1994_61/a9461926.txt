Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project develops low-cost
              technological tools to enable students at the middle-school level to perform
              science experiments using computerized data collection and analysis. Such
              equipment is vital for learning and performing modern science. Tanner Research
              proposes to design rugged sensors and computer interfaces based on integrated
              circuits, thereby making them very inexpensive to produce in bulk, along with
              an easy-to-use software package that together will allow students to conduct
              hands-on science experiments using modern data collection methods. Tanner
              Research's in-house expertise in computer software and electronic hardware
              development, combined with both in-house and consultant experience in
              precollege education, make Tanner Research uniquely qualified to realize this
              goal. This Phase I effort concentrates on the initial specification and design
              of prototype sensor hardware and interactive software. These prototype
              materials will be integrated with segments of the science curriculum in use by
              collaborators in the Caltech Precollege Science Initiative (CAPSI). Phase II
              involves refinement of the initial prototypes, and field testing in
              collaboration with the CAPSI program.
