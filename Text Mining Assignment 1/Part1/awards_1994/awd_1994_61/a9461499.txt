Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research project will demonstrate a novel
              membrane inlet for cone penetrometers instrumented for chemical detection in
              soil and groundwater.  Cone penetrometers are now used to understand site
              geology at remediation sites. Cone penetrometers equipped with chemical sensors
              will reduce site remediation costs by allowing the currently required
              geophysical stuty to be combined with a chemical survey. This will minimize the
              number of expensive wells required. Further, chemical analyses, now routinely
              done in the laboratory at significant expense, will be done in the field. Field
              engineers will be able to make remediation decisions in real time at minimum
              cost. Recent efforts to instrument cone penetrometers have used large
              sophisticated laser systems which send light underground through fiber optic
              cable and return the signal to the surface for analysis. These systems can cost
              $250,000. This research will develop a membrane inlet for cone penetrometers
              which will make it possible to instrument a cone penetrometer with inexpensive,
              in-situ, chemical vapor sensors with a projected system cost of under $10,000.
              The phase I objective is to demonstrate a membrane inlet in the laboratory with
              typical chemicals found in remediation sites. The overall program objective is
              to built and demonstrate a fully operational cone penetrometer system at two
              remediation sites.
