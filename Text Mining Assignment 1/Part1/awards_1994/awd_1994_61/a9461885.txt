Abstract    :
              The recent emergence of high performance massively parallel processing (MPP)
              computers has theoretically reduced the computer time required for the design
              and analysis of systems involving fluid flow using Computational Fluid Dynamics
              (CFD). However, in practice, algorithms used in MPP today were developed for
              sequential computers and therefore do not harness the full power of massively
              parallel processing. Also, MPP computers have not simplified the structured
              grid generation process, which may take weeks for complex configurations. 
              Amtec proposes to develop a new algorithm for computational fluid dynamics to
              harness the power of MPP. The research will focus on techniques for solving the
              Navier-Stokes equations on MPP computers using hybrid structured/unstructured
              finite-volume meshes. The structured grids will be used to resolve boundary
              layers near walls and unstructured grids will be used to discretize the
              remainder of the flow field. During phase I, a recently developed implicit
              procedure for 2D hybrid grids will be improved and parallelized using a novel
              domain decomposition technique. The new solution procedure will simplify the
              grid generation process by using hybrid grids, and reduce the computer time
              required by efficiently using MPP computers.
