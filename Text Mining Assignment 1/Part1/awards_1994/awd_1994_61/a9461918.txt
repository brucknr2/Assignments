Abstract    :
              The advancement of pollution control technologies is being treated as a high
              priority in the U.S. One important step involves the development of ultra-high
              performance systems for the removal of fine particles from processing streams
              or plant effluents. In this program, LSR Technologies, Inc., will investigate
              and develop a novel electrostatic precipitator (ESP) concept with controlled
              solids reentrainment and turbulence intensity. The concept eliminates
              deficiencies generic to the conventional ESP and associated with: high or low
              dust resistivity; particulate space charge effects; rapping reentrainment due
              to mixing of gas and broken dust layers; and seepage due to leakage from below
              the precipitator over the hoppers. It also reduces the intensity of turbulence
              in the ESP, in turn improving gas/solids separation efficiency. The Phase I
              research will focus on proof-of-principle testing which will include an
              analysis of the effect of controlling turbulence intensity on precipitator
              performance. The Phase II effort would include extensive testing at the
              pilot-scale level.
