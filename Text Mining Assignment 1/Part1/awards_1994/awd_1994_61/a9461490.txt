Abstract    :
              Genetic engineering techniques have been used to produce proteins with modified
              functions and to isolate proteins that are difficult to purify from natural
              sources. The most commonly used technology, based on expression in prokaryotic
              cells, is not satisfactory in all cases because the proteins are not
              appropriately modified and are often produced in relatively insoluble forms.
              The baculovirus expression system has been used as an alternative because
              insect cells infected with baculovirus vectors produce proteins that are
              post-translationally modified and that are expressed in high levels in the
              appropriate cell compartment. In addition, large DNA fragments have been
              successfully incorporated into baculovirus vectors. The complexity of the
              culture conditions for insect cells and the requirements for specialized
              equipment for scale-up have limited the application of this technology. An
              inexpensive and relatively simple alternative is to produce the recombinant
              protein in insect larvae. While this method has been used in research
              laboratories to generate recombinant proteins, the potential for use in
              large-scale manufacturing has not been demonstrated. Biotechnology Transfer,
              Inc. proposes to examine the technical, operational, and economic feasibility
              of using the insect larval system for expression of a lymphokine using a
              baculovirus expression system. The gene for IL-2 will be cloned into
              baculovirus and the recombinant virus fed to larvae. The protein will be
              purified using ion exchange and immunoaffinity chromatography,  and
              characterized biochemically and functionally.  Finally, issues of
              reproducibility and scale-up will be examined.
