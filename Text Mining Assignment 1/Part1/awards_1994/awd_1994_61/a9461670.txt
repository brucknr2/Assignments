Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the
              fabrication of high-power circulators. Ferrite junction circulators that
              operate under high power conditions are currently narrow band devices, since
              they are necessarily biased above ferromagnetic resonance (FMR). In order to
              increase the frequency bandwidth and still operate at high power Massachusetts
              Technological Laboratory  proposes to fabricate circulators in a six-port
              geometry. In a six-port design the ports are alternatively connected to open
              circuits which serve as stub-tune capacitors. In preliminary calculations, it
              has been shown in six-port design that it is possible to achieve a bandwidth of
              15 % of the central circulation frequency. This is compared to a conventional
              junction circulator biased above FMR where the bandwidth is approximately 5% of
              the central frequency. High-power wide-band circulators capable of handling a
              few hundred kilowatts are currently needed in the design of R/T modules
              deployed in front of power transmitters. Researchers believe that the proposed
              work will have potential for both military and commercial applications.
