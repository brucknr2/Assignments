Abstract    :
              Although high temperature Bi-2212 superconductors have been fabricated in round
              multifilamentary  practical conductor form and have demonstrated excellent
              potential (Jc  165,000 A/cm2 at 4.2K) for commercialization, the need still
              exists to use scalable techniques to achieve high uniformity, good
              densification and high critical current densities (Jc) in long lengths of wire.
              The work proposed here will use hot rolling and hot drawing as a means to
              demonstrate the feasibility of this approach to obtain improved texture,
              density and uniformity in HTS Bi-2212 composite conductors. During Phase I of
              this program, efforts will concentrate on optimizing process parameters
              associated with hot processing.  Success in Phase I will lead to scale up of
              the hot processing of longer lengths and/or billets in Phase II, to
              reproducibly and consistently achieve good superconducting properties resulting
              in significant cost savings.
