Abstract    :
              Plastics have become commonplace in biomaterial applications. In diverse uses
              ranging from intraocular lenses to vascular prostheses, polymers are often the
              materials of choice because their unique combination of properties provide
              excellent mimics of natural systems. However, plastics have been of limited use
              in load-bearing applications (such as bone replacements or supports) because of
              their poor mechanical properties. Unfortunately, the metals that are used as
              bone substitutes are also not ideal because they are much stronger and stiffer
              than natural bone and promote the resorption of surrounding tissue. A family of
              substituted poly (para-phenylene) thermoplastics, Poly-Xá, has recently been
              developed at Maxdem which offers promise in load-bearing biomaterial
              applications. The mechanical properties of these unreinforced polymers are
              fortuitously very similar to natural bone materials. In addition, these
              polymers feature exceptional scratch resistances that could translate into
              outstanding wear properties. Coupling these properties with the facile
              processing requirements and potentially low cost of Poly-Xá materials, make
              these polymers an exciting alternative for the next generation of load-bearing
              orthopedic devices. This proposal addresses preliminary wear and toxicity
              measurements on these truly remarkable materials.
