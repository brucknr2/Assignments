Abstract    :
              The objective of this program is to develop high intensity, large area, directed
              atomic nitrogen beam sources for molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). The nitrogen
              beam source will be based on an inductively-driven plasma accelerator that
              efficiently ionizes and accelerates plasma to energies between 1 and 100 eV.
              The plasma beam will have densities between 1015 and 1017 cm-3. At these high
              plasma densities, molecular ions such as N2 or NH3 decompose rapidly,
              generating a high intensity, high energy atomic plasma beam. When operated at
              high pulse rates, average beam current densities of 1-10 A/cm2 can be
              delivered. This beam current density is a factor of 100 to 1000 times higher
              than achievable with existing rf or ECR plasma sources. Moreover, the nitrogen
              source may be configured with beam cross sections from 0.1 to 1 m2 and with an
              average beam power scaleable to tens of kilowatts or higher, allowing for broad
              area, high rate growth of GaN, AlN and other nitrides. In Phase I, the
              feasibility of this electrodeless atomic/plasma beam accelerator technology
              will be experimentally analyzed as a high power nitrogen source for MBE. An
              optimized atomic nitrogen beam source will be designed for fabrication in Phase
              II. The Phase II program is structured to experimentally characterize and
              optimize this nitrogen beam source for MBE.
