Abstract    :
              Among the isotopes used in Mossbauer spectroscopy (MS), 67Zn has the highest
              energy resolution (5 x 10-16 ) and an extreme sensitivity for the measurements
              of hyperfine interactions, to determine the electric field gradient (EFG)
              tensor and internal magnetic field at the nucleus. The distribution of charges
              between lattice sites can then be calculated from the EFG. Since 67Cu is a
              source for 67Zn MS, the technique has been used to study high Tc
              superconductors. With the use of emission MS, the superconductor is doped with
              67Cu, and it is known precisely where the 67Zn daughter is formed in the
              crystal structure. The difficulty in obtaining 67Zn spectra, with line widths
              of 0.31 microns/sec, and the poor signal/noise, has limited the use of this
              technique to a few laboratories. A new type Mossbauer Spectrometer is needed
              and has been designed based on an experiment by Grodzins and Phillips. Rather
              than moving a source or absorber, as has been done with a conventional Doppler
              velocity modulation spectrometer, the optical ((-ray) path is changed as a
              function of time. This is achieved by moving a plastic wedge, or a plastic
              wheel at an angle to the drive shaft in the (-ray beam. For 67Zn, a shift of
              one line width corresponds to a rotation of 100 RPM. In this technique, the
              source and the absorber can be rigidly mounted together and virtually eliminate
              any vibrational noise. The signal to noise in MS can be greatly improved with
              the use of a resonant detector. These detectors have been developed for 57Fe,
              119Sn and 151Eu. 67Zn is an ideal candidate. Resonant detectors make use of the
              conversion electrons that compete with the (-ray emission after the resonant
              absorption. The conversion electrons are detected by an organic plastic
              scintillator filled with a 67Zn enriched inorganic absorber placed in contact
              with a photomultiplier. The only significant noise parameter is the
              photoelectric effect, but for Zn this cross section is 103 times smaller. Even
              with a recoil free fraction of only 2%, the net gain is a factor of 20.
