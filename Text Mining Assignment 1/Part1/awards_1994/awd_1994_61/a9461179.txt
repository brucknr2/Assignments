Abstract    :
              9461179  Bryant    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I will
              investigate using microencapsulated phase change materials (microPCMs) in a
              fabric layer as a thermal barrier to extend the endurance and productivity of
              underwater divers in cold water.  MicroPCM-enhanced fabrics could be used alone
              (passively) or in conjunction with an auxiliary heating device (actively).  For
              Phase I research purposed, the research emphasis will be on studying the
              effectiveness of a microPCM fabric as a thermal barrier in a diver's dry suit. 
              However the concepts developed here will also apply to wet suits.  Phase I
              objectives will be to: select, encapsulate and evaluate thermal properties of
              appropriate PCMS; acquire coated microPCM fabric samples and controls and
              evaluate their thermal properties; design laboratory tests to evaluate thermal
              performance of test fabrics; and evaluate thermal performance of test fabrics
              with and without auxiliary heating.  The potential use of microPCM material to
              keep diver's comfortable and extend their work period will be thoroughly
              examined and recommendations made to the NSF for a follow-on Phase II effort.
