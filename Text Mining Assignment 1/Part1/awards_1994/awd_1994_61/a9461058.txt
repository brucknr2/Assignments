Abstract    :
              Many techniques have been used in the past to measure the concentration of
              volatile organic compounds in the soil and ground water. Some of these
              techniques require chemical reactions that result in different molecules that
              are then sensed optically. Other techniques measure the optical absorption of
              the species to be detected. In almost all instances, a special instrument must
              be used for each chemical species. This is both expensive and time consuming.
              Moreover, as chemical reactions are necessary in some instances and detector
              sensitivity is poor and noise sources abound in the infrared, the accuracy of
              some of these systems is suspect. Lasergenics Corporation are proposing to
              demonstrate the sensitivity and wide applicability of Raman scattering to the
              detection of ppm or less concentrations of volatile organic compounds. This
              technique has several advantages over present techniques. As the scattered
              light is in the visible region of the spectrum, very sensitive photomultipliers
              can be used. Also few noise sources exist. They will construct a breadboard
              system and measure the sensitivity of this system for four of the most
              widespread volatile organic compounds. An argon laser operating at 488 nm will
              be used as the light source and photon counting will be the detection method.
