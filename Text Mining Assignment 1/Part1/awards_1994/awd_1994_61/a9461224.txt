Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will investigate and
              demonstrate a novel, short response time, low temperature chemical sensor based
              on nanoceramic materials. Nanoceramics are a broad new class of materials that
              have been artificially modulated in zero to three dimensions on scales less
              than 100 nm The nanoscale modulation bestows nanoceramics with interfacial
              properties tailored to the molecular scale, unprecedented microstructures, and
              unique properties Such interface engineering has created an exceptional
              opportunity to design and commercialize novel chemical sensors. Nanomaterials
              Research Corporation (NRC) will develop and demonstrate these sensors through
              this program. During this program, NRC will synthesize and evaluate
              nanoceramic-based low temperature, low cost, short response time oxygen
              sensors. Nanomaterials Research Corporation expects to establish the
              proof-of-concept of the sensor during Phase I, optimize, completely
              characterize and field test the sensor during Phase II; and during Phase III,
              commercialize the sensors to niche markets.
