Abstract    :
              Reaction Engineering International proposes to develop a chemistry sub-model for
              the incorporation of detailed chemical kinetic rates and equilibrium
              considerations into reacting flow models. The objectives of this project
              include demonstrating the feasibility of including chemical equilibrium
              considerations in a method designed to reduce chemical kinetic mechanisms,
              creating a chemistry tool that is accessible to a generic reacting flow model,
              and demonstrating the utility of the sub-model. It is the intent of the
              proposed research to develop a strategy through which the underlying physics of
              specific reaction processes can be extracted from detailed chemical kinetic and
              thermodynamic data, and subsequently used in reacting flow computations. The
              approach will not rely on partial equilibrium or steady-state assumptions and
              will allow one to accurately determine non-equilibrium levels of species.
              Furthermore, the chemical sub-model to be developed will accurately account for
              and be able to consider entities (or species) for which there is no chemical
              kinetic information.
