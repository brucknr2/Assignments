Abstract    :
                This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will investigate the
              feasibility of application of stochastically distributed microstructures for
              high performance field emission electron sources.  At the present, the
              state-of-the-art high-current  cathodes employ microfabricated field emitters
              that feature submicron tips with a packing density of the order of 10 7 / cm 2
              and are capable of delivering a peak current density on the order of 1000 A/cm
              2.  However, the arrays of miniaturized field emitters require rather
              complicated and expensive processes to produce, hampering proliferation of
              electron sources based on these structures.  This proposal describes a novel
              technique that has the potential to break through the current maximum output
              current density while significantly reducing the fabrication cost.  Inexpensive
              templates that are commercially available will be used to fabricate
              stochastically distributed microstructures in a simple electrochemical process.
               The technique permits significantly higher packing density of field emission
              sites and larger active field emission area per microstructure, compared with
              the conventional microtip array cathode.  The simplicity of this technique
              makes it a very promising approach for the fabrication of commercially viable
              high performance and broad-area cathodes.
