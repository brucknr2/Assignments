Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will focus on addressing
              the demand for high quality, innovative, educational software that dramatically
              increase the motivation to learn about mathematics, as well as the depth of
              mathematics learning, in children. The objective of this effort is to
              demonstrate the feasibility of the development of an educational software
              product that teaches children mathematics in practical contexts relevant to
              their lives. As such, the research in this Phase will be devoted to extracting
              core principles of design and concepts in the literature that best lend
              themselves to this endeavor, and to then developing an application framework
              and subsequent specific creative content ideas to meet the objective. It is
              expected that the effort will yield promising results and approaches for
              commercially-viable educational software products for the teaching of
              mathematics. Further, it is expected that the design techniques and process can
              potentially be leveraged for the design and development of educational software
              products for other domains as well.
