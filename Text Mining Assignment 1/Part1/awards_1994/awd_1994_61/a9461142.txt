Abstract    :
              Marlow Industries will be fabricating `filled` Skutterudite materials and
              determining their thermoelectric properties in the refrigeration and lower
              power generation temperature range (77K-350K). The recent verification of
              promisingly high mobilities, and low thermal conductivities measured in the
              basic Skutterudite family, and the independent confirmation of these values,
              have established an entirely new family of potential materials. The inherent
              advantage of these materials is their availability in powder and crystal form,
              their cubic symmetry, and their potential for high thermoelectric transport
              properties. The materials chosen to fill the two vacancies in the Skutterudite
              unit cell will be chosen to explore p and n-type materials and to determine
              their effect on further reducing the thermal conductivity by changing the
              molecular weight, atomic radius and valence state of the `filler`. The obvious
              impact on the refrigeration, air conditioning and power generation market make
              this program essential to the maintenance of U.S. industry leadership in these
              markets. Phase I will evaluate the potential of these materials and define the
              nature of the barriers to be overcome to achieve economically viable synthesis
              pathways in the follow on Phase II.
