Abstract    :
              9461759   Olsen     In this SBIR Phase I Sensors Unlimited, Inc. explores  the
              design and optimization of  a  high-performance avalanche photodiode for the
              1.0-1.65 micron spectral region.  The innovation  uses  strained epitaxial
              layers combined with multiquantum-well (MQW) InGaAsP/InP layers.  A strained
              layer distorts the valence band of the multiplying (gain) region to reduce the
              field at which ionization occurs.  This reduces device operating voltage and
              would also increase the ratio of hole/electron ionization coefficients
              (compared to the unstrained case) and thus decrease noise.  A strained layer
              InGaAsP/InP MQW device will be constructed, and  ionization coefficients will
              be measured and compared with the unstrained case.  In Phase II,  fabrication
              and optimization of a reliable planar structure for light response out to 1.65
              micron are planned to explore the advantages of low voltage, low noise
              operation, high gain, and high yield.
