Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will seek to deposit
              functionally gradient material (FGM) ceramic coatings on aluminum susceptor
              materials to encapsulate the  susceptor and prevent contamination of silicon
              wafers during fabrication. Aluminum/aluminum nitride FGM coatings, which are
              100% Al at the substrate interface and 100% AlN on the exposed surface with a
              gradual transition between the two extremes, will be deposited using an ion
              beam assisted deposition (IBAD). IBAD is a unique process which combines
              evaporation with concurrent ion beam bombardment to controllably produce
              ultra-adherent thin films with excellent control over film structure and
              chemistry. The AlN coating layer will act as a diffusion barrier to eliminate
              aluminum contamination in high-temperature semiconductor fabrication. The
              graded nature of the coating will reduce interfacial delamination and
              facilitate a gradual shift of the thermal expansion coefficient, thus reducing
              the probability of failures associated with thermal expansion mismatch and
              increasing the working lifetime of the coating. In Phase I, coating conditions
              will be varied to produce Al/AlN FGM coatings on sample coupons of Al.
              Analytical evaluation and thermal cycle performance testing will be used as
              feedback for additional processing parameter development and coating
              optimization. Phase I will produce an adherent, durable FGM coating which
              withstands thermal cycling. The project will also provide analytical data about
              coating chemistry and coating structures for further parameter optimization in
              Phase II.
