Abstract    :
              DMI-9461628  Higgins     Vapor permeation holds much promise for becoming a
              highly efficient means of preventing VOC emissions that are now generated by a
              variety of stationary resources.  Limitations of current vapor permeation (VP)
              processes are low selectivity and low upper temperature constraints (ca. 100 to
              125 degrees centigrade) for polymeric VP membranes.  In most cases, these
              result in the need to employ large membrane areas, multi-stage operation and
              the cooling of compressed air feed.  Wider application of the technology would
              be possible if inexpensive VP modules with highly selective membranes operable
              at appreciably higher temperature were available.  This research addresses
              development of such devices by use of novel zeolite-filled polymeric membranes
              in combination with low-cost, highly compact ceramic ultrfiltration modules as
              VP membrane supports.  In this Phase I program, novel zeolite-filled membranes
              will be developed. Highselectivity of these membranes for removal of priority
              AVOC's from air will be demonstrated.  an innovative method will be used to
              apply then, defect-free vapor permeation membranes tot he ceramic supports to
              from zeolite-polymer-ceramic composite membranes.  These vapor permeation
              membranes will be tested at temperatures ranging from 100 to 200 degrees
              centigrade for removal of VOCs I synthetic gas streams at a laboratory scale. 
              The sorption and diffusion properties of both pure zeolite and zeolite-filled
              membranes will be determined.  In Phase II work, membrane fabrication procedure
              would be optimized to prepare very then membranes, larger size VP modules would
              be produced, and operation up to 300 degrees centigrade would be demonstrated.
