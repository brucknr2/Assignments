Abstract    :
                This availability of a compact e-beam with low cost and lack of high voltage
              leads would be attractive for use in non-destructive evaluation (NDE), process
              control, and imaging.  NDE applications continues to grow and place new
              requirements on the sources of X-rays.  To evaluate thick cross sections, high
              energy X-rays are needed.  In certain cases, access is also limited.  This is
              especially true during periodic inspection of ships, airplanes, etc.  In this
              SBIR Phase I proposal, a new device for the production of compact, high current
              (mA's), variable energy electron beams will be discussed.  The device uses
              cyclotron acceleration of electrons.  The acceleration takes place in a
              microwave cavity with an axial magnetic field.  The resonant frequency of the
              cavity coincides with the electron cyclotron frequency.  A high heat-flux
              capability target ( a heatpipe or a porous metal heat exchanger), is used to
              generate the X-rays.  The energy of the electrons at the target may be varied
              by changing the radial location of the target.
