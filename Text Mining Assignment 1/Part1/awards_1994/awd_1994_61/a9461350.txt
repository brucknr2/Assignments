Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the problem of
              selenium contaminated waters. Selenium is presently the primary water treatment
              challenge for many West Coast petroleum refineries and irrigated farm lands.
              Selenium can be found in refinery process streams at levels up to 5 mg/L with
              flowrates reaching 1000 gallons per minute. Similarly, in the Westlands Water
              District alone, there is a current need for the disposal of 2 million gallons
              per day of agricultural drainage water with selenium concentrations reaching
              0.5 mg/L. Because of its known toxicity and suspected carcinogenicity, the
              discharge limits as set by the Clean Water Act are very low (0.260 mg/L
              maximum, 0.035 mg/L continuous for selenium). The California discharge
              standards allow effluents to contain no more than 0.05 mg/L selenium. Processes
              developed for selenium removal from drinking water (anion exchange and
              activated alumina) are too expensive for the treatment of industrial
              wastewaters. In particular, these processes are appropriate for small volumes
              of water with low levels of dissolved and suspended solids. These processes are
              only feasible when competing anions such as sulfates or carbonates are absent.
              Therefore, TDA Research proposes to develop a new specialty extractant to
              remove selenium from contaminated water streams. In Phase I we will synthesize
              novel metal-chelating ligands capable of selectively extracting heavy metal
              anions, like selenium, in the presence of common but non-hazardous anions such
              as sulfate, carbonate, and chloride. We will then conduct experiments to
              demonstrate their ability to selectively extract selenium over competing anions
              like sulfates.
