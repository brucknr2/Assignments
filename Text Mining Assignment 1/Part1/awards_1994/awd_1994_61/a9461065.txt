Abstract    :
              One critically needed improvement in mass spectrometry is increased ion detector
              dynamic range. Mass spectrometry is the most widely used analytical technique
              to analyze the chemical and structural properties molecules and compounds, with
              many applications in chemistry, biotechnology, and environmental science. The
              innovation NOVA Scientific, Inc. proposes will improve by several orders of
              magnitude the upper count rate limit in commercially available microchannel
              plate (MCP) ion detectors, widely used in mass spectrometry as well as other
              applications. The substantial reduction in MCP detector gain or efficiency
              which usually occurs from deadtime losses at high output count rates, will no
              longer occur. They will refine and commercialize a novel heat sinking approach
              using extremely low resistance MCPs; in earlier proof-of-concept experiments
              this approach resulted in count rates of 1010 to 1011 cm-2s-1, compared with
              106 to 108 cm-2s-1 for conventional MCP detectors. This radical departure in
              MCP operation and mounting configuration will, if successful, have a
              significant impact in mass spectrometry; in particular, it will allow faster
              and more efficient chemical analysis. It will also impact many other commercial
              and scientific applications. In parallel, they will assess novel MCP single
              anode as well as imaging readouts which are compatible with this approach.
