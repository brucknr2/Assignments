Abstract    :
              This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research proposal concerns the
              development of a new process for destroying unwanted byproducts and
              environmental pollutants in water using ozone and hydrogen peroxide. There is
              continuing and increasing interest in the use of these chemical oxidants in
              industrial and environmental practices. The proposed research involves the
              paired electrochemical synthesis of both ozone and hydrogen peroxide in a
              single electrochemical reactor. The benefits of combining these two reactions
              are: (1) lower operating costs, as two oxidizing agents can be obtained for the
              price of one; (2) the elimination of the need for transportation and storage of
              hydrogen peroxide which can be generated on demand; (3) both oxidants together
              provide enhanced oxidation capabilities over the use of either oxidant alone;
              (4) aqueous phase ozone concentrations that can be generated electrochemically
              significantly exceed those obtainable by conventional methods of ozone
              generation; (5) electrochemical ozone generation requires simplified equipment
              compared to the conventional method of ozone generation allowing compact
              modular design for easier on-site installation and transportation between
              treatment sites. Synthesizing ozone and hydrogen peroxide in a single reactor
              is a considerable challenge because each requires fundamentally distinct
              reaction conditions. The proposed research addresses these difficulties through
              the development of a new type of electrochemical cell.
