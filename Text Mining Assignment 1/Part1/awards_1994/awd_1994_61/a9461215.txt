Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to demonstrate the
              feasibility of a thin film solid-host dye laser pumped by energetic electrons.
              Solid host dye lasers are of interest because they offer tunability and a
              choice of wavelength range, pulse width and repetition rate without the need
              for solvent/dye circulation and disposal; solid hosts may improve dye lifetime
              and performance, as well. Recently, Jet Process Corporation (JPC) used its Jet
              Vapor Deposition (JVD) thin film technique to successfully make bulk solid host
              dye laser media; these were based on JVD `organic guest-inorganic host` films
              in which Rhodamine 6G molecules were trapped at high concentration in films
              such as silicon dioxide. Pumping by green light from a YAG laser stimulated
              laser emission from the trapped Rhodamine 6G molecules. In Phase I JPC proposes
              to investigate pumping by energetic electrons in the solid as an alternative to
              optical pumping by a laser or flashlamp. If successful, this strategy would
              lead to a portable dye laser pumped by a small power supply or batteries. In
              addition, thin film electron pumped dye lasers could easily be incorporated
              into novel integrated optical electronic circuits. These devices would be
              entirely fabricated by low cost JVD techniques, and many applications and
              markets in medicine and industry would become possible. In order to test this
              idea in Phase I, JPC will use JVD host-guest techniques to trap Rhodamine 6G
              molecules in transparent conducting indium oxide films, construct a diode, and
              look for light emission as a function of applied voltage and current flow.
              Success in Phase I would confirm a new approach to dye laser operation; in
              Phase II JPC will optimize laser power and efficiency, make a portable low cost
              dye laser, and integrate thin film dye lasers into microelectronic circuits and
              devices.
