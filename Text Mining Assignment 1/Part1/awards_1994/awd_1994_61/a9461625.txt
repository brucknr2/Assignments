Abstract    :
              Direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) powered vehicles are foreseen as the choice of
              the future. However, the development of DMFC has been hampered by several
              technical challenges such as anode poisoning and permeation of methanol through
              the polymer electrolyte membrane into the cathode compartment. Approximately
              100-150 mV loss in cell voltage can be attributed to the presence of methanol
              in the cathode compartment; part of the loss is attributable to the mixed
              potential phenomenon, and part to the inactivation of the cathode catalyst.
              Therefore, it is desirable to develop a membrane electrolyte that will prevent
              or minimize the permeation of methanol. This proposal addresses certain
              approaches toward minimizing methanol permeation through membrane
              modifications. A compounded or laminated membrane that will exhibit reduced
              methanol permeability, while maintaining facile proton transport will be
              developed using a combination of certain inert polymeric materials and
              perfluorosulfonic acid polymers. Membranes found to have adequate ionic
              conductivity and reduced methanol permeability will be tested in a PEM fuel
              cell with methanol as the fuel.
