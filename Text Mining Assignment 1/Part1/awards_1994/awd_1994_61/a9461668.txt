Abstract    :
              This project will fabricate a vertical cavity surface-emitting LED/laser by
              implanting Er into porous silicon (produced from poly-porous silicon on glass).
              Spire was the first to demonstrate: (a) porous polysilicon with
              quantum-confined properties and (b) strong, room-temperature IR emission from
              Er-doped porous Si. Their results clearly indicate that optical emission
              efficiency of Er in porous silicon at room temperature is comparable to
              In0.53Ga0.47As material, used for commercial infrared LEDs. Strong temperature
              dependence of IR intensity for Er-implanted bulk Si is a major obstacle
              preventing the application of Si:Er in optoelectronics.  Results show about a
              50% decrease in IR intensity for porous Si when the temperature is raised from
              77K to room temperature, as compared to a decrease of a factor of 1000 for Er
              in bulk Si. In Phase I, they will deposit a transparent conductor (such as ITO)
              onto a glass substrate, followed by polysilicon. After processing to fabricate
              porous polysilicon with quantum-confined properties, samples will be implanted
              with erbium and annealed to recrystallize the silicon nanostructures. Finally,
              they will deposit a thin metal film mirror/contact, to complete a porous
              polycrystalline silicon-based infrared Schottky LED. Phase II will concentrate
              on optimization and commercialization of the devices, and on formation of
              optical cavities to produce IR lasers.
