Abstract    :
              Conventional techniques for accelerometers yield micromechanical structures
              whose sensitive axis is perpendicular to the surface of the wafer. There is a
              need for new micromechanical designs and new transduction techniques which
              allow the sensitive axis of the microstructures to lie in the plane of the
              wafer in order to measure six degrees of freedom. A new optical transduction
              technique and a new micromechanical design are illustrated which allow the
              sensitive axis to lie in the plane of the wafer and which eliminate cross-talk.
              This has the advantage that several structures can be integrated monolithically
              in the same wafer with multidegrees-of-freedom measurement capability. The
              sensor incorporates a polymer waveguide and is fabricated with the use of laser
              ablation of materials. The major task is to develop a fabrication process which
              is compatible with the characteristics of all the materials utilized. A
              comprehensive study of all the pertinent process parameters affecting the
              performance of the polymer waveguide will be conducted.
