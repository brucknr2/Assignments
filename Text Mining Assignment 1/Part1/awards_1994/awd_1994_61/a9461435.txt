Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will address the
              feasibility of a turn-key Differential Absorption LIDAR (DIAL) system for the
              measurement of atmospheric water vapor and temperature profiles. Advanced
              atmospheric models require spatially resolved measurements of humidity and
              temperature at high altitude where existing measurement techniques are
              inaccurate. To address these needs, the proposed system combines commercially
              available laser sources to generate well controlled, narrow line width pulses
              that will allow remote measurement of water vapor concentration with a
              sensitivity of 0.5 mg/kg and temperatures to within 2 K. The system will be
              constructed from laser sources that are well developed and have already been
              engineered for high reliability. Wavelength control will be provided by a
              single-mode diode laser amplified to suitable pulse energies. Characterizing
              the amplified diode laser pulses will be the key research objective in Phase I.
              Use of a pulse-amplified cw laser will result in improved frequency control
              that is essential for accurate measurement at the tropopause and lower
              stratosphere. Furthermore, by taking advantage of both the tunability and
              narrow line width of a single-mode diode laser, water absorption line ratios
              can be measured from which remote temperatures can be determined. The system
              will be compact, robust, have high wall-plug efficiency, and will operate
              safely in a look-down geometry.
