Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is directed toward
              improving Flexible Integrated Manufacturing (FIM) by making robots more
              flexible, thereby increasing economic competitiveness. Specifically, this will
              be achieved by researching and developing robust triaxial force sensor arrays
              for robot end-effectors so that less specialized end-of-arm tooling can be used
              for a variety of automation tasks. Besides reducing the need for custom
              end-effectors, the triaxial arrays, or triaxial tactile sensors, will also
              provide critical force information during robot tasks. This information can be
              used to monitor the process or in feedback control of the robot to assure that
              parts are properly grasped, to detect and possibly correct of slippage, and to
              guide manipulation.  In Phase I Bonneville Scientific, Inc., will attempt to
              establish the feasibility of an ultrasonic technique for triaxial force
              sensing. If successful, this will provide the basis for the further research
              and development in Phase II, culminating with a complete computer-based
              triaxial tactile sensor system. Besides use in industrial automation, the
              triaxial sensors will have application ranging from automotive tire testing and
              development to foot force sensing and gait analysis.
