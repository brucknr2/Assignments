Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a standard
              method of providing computer access to people with physical disabilities. In
              recent years the use of personal computers in education has increased
              dramatically. Because many people with physical disabilities are not able to
              use a keyboard or a mouse, it is difficult to provide them with equal access to
              this education. A variety of devices have been developed which provide an
              alternate means of controlling computers but their usefulness is seriously
              compromised by the lack of a standard method of providing computer control. The
              recent introduction of the PCMCIA bus, a technology which uses credit card
              sized interface devices, provides an opportunity to standardize computer access
              for people with disabilities. This project will develop software interfaces
              which will allow personal computers to be controlled through the PCMCIA bus. A
              family of interface devices will also be developed. The design characteristics
              of the software will be documented in an open standard which will be provided
              to both the computer industry and manufacturers of assistive technology.
