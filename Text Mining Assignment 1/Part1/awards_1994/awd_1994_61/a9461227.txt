Abstract    :
              Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) technology has great promise for
              electric vehicle transportation. State-of-the-art PEMFC technology, however,
              requires heavy loadings of expensive noble metal catalysts which make them too
              expensive for automotive application. Significant reduction of PEMFC cost could
              potentially be realized with high efficiency, ultra-low loading catalyst
              electrodes. Jet Process Corp. proposes to use our novel, patented,
              award-winning, pollution-free Jet Vapor Deposition (JVD) process to address
              this problem. JVD is capable of high rate, highly efficient deposition of metal
              and metal oxide films and nanoscopic particles. They will deposit ultra-low
              loadings of high surface area, nanometer-size platinum and platinum/ruthenium
              oxide electrocatalyst particles directly onto the surface of Nafion (DuPont)
              polymer electrolyte membranes. In collaboration with International Fuel Cells
              Inc., a leading U.S. supplier of fuel cell technology, the researchers will
              test and evaluate Phase I samples to determine the catalytic activity of these
              ultra-low loading electrodes. They will also develop preliminary studies on
              process scaleup and production economics.
