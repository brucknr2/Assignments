Abstract    :
              9461103  Argade    Proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) power sources
              utilizing hydrogen and oxygel can be used for many applications. So far, most
              of the fuel-cell power plants are based on alkaline or phosphoric acid fuel
              cells. Conventional polymeric proton exchange membrane fuel cells offer a
              number of advantages, but require water management to maintain good
              performance. If proton exchange membranes are available which can operate near
              200 degrees Celsius, it will lead to a significant technological breakthrough
              in terms of reliability, improved energy efficiency, and lower cost. Reduced
              platinum catalyst loading or use of non-precious metal catalysts, and most
              importantly alleviation of water management problems, will lead to a compact,
              lower weight fuel cell system using high-temperature PEMs. Thermal management
              of the system will also be easier due to the higher operating temperature, an
              important consideration for many applications. The proposed Phase I program
              will focus on novel inorganic proton exchange materials with stable crystal
              structures to very high temperatures and demonstration of the feasibility of a
              water/oxygen fuel cell based on a membrane made from these materials. The Phase
              II program is projected to concentrate on scale up of the processes of membrane
              preparation, methanol/air fuel cell development, system considerations and long
              term performance evaluation. Successful development of this technology will be
              most useful for improvement of energy recovery from coal via the methanol
              route.
