Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will explore the
              technology needed to allow the development of voice-interactive computer aids
              for learning spoken languages. The project will make use of state-of-the-art
              speech recognition and understanding technology developed at MIT as part of the
              ARPA speech program. Specifically, the proposed work will use statistical
              segmental models to distinguish between correct and incorrect pronunciations by
              students learning a second language. These models will be trained in a similar
              way to the models used for speaker-independent speech recognition. In the Phase
              I research project, the feasibility of this approach will be shown by
              collecting a pilot speech corpus of students speaking the target language, the
              corpus will be labeled according to human judgments of pronunciation, and
              statistical models will be trained and tested on separate portions of this
              corpus.
