Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project focuses on applying
              coding theory techniques to automate alarm correlation in complex networks.
              Alarms indicate exceptional network states or behaviors, e.g., failure or
              congestion, which require immediate handling to avoid disrupting network
              operations. In a networked system, a single problem can result in large numbers
              of alarms manifested by multiple system components. Alarm correlation
              correlates these various symptoms to accurately identify the problems requiring
              handling, and is thus a central component in network operations and management
              (OAM). As enterprises' reliance on networked systems grows, OAM consumes an
              increasingly higher percentage of information technology budgets, currently
              estimated at 65-90%, mainly due to high labor costs. Automation of alarm
              correlation can substantially reduce OAM costs while improving their quality.
              System Management Arts, Inc., anticipates that techniques based on coding
              theory can yield up to 2 orders of magnitude improvement in alarm correlation
              performance over today's techniques, while increasing both their accuracy and
              robustness.
