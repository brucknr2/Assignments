Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project proposes to develop a
              system to forecast ionospheric currents and related effects, such as
              enhancements in the auroral oval heating, density irregularities and ground
              induced currents at customer specific locations . These forecasts will depend
              directly on real-time measurements of the solar wind velocity, density and
              interplanetary magnetic field. A novel, new method, the state-space approach,
              has been developed for classifying and predicting active geomagnetic intervals
              and substorm occurrences. Application of this method to space weather
              forecasting will provide, for the first time, 1 to 2 hour forecasts of
              impending geomagnetic storm and substorm activity which can be used to improve
              ground-based operations such as power distribution, pipeline management, and
              six-sigma manufacturing, and positively impact the functionality and
              reliability of communications, navigation and space operations. Complementing
              space weather forecasting systems currently being developed for the NOAA Space
              Environment Service Center (SESC) and the Air Force Space Forecast Center
              (AFSFC), the proposed product will provide customer specific forecasts for both
              commercial and government space and ground based applications. At the end of
              Phase III of this proposed system Mission Research Corporation projects an
              operating value-added space weather service, complementing the capabilities of
              the AFSFC and the SESC, for commercial and government customers.
