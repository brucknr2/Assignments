Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate the
              feasibility of a Giant Magnetoresistance Ratio (GMR) tunneling transistor. GMR
              tunneling devices can potentially have a room temperature magnetoresistance of
              50% (many times the magnetoresistance of simple two-layer magnetic sandwiches)
              with a high impedance and high areal density, and can operate with small
              magnetic fields (one Oe). These devices can be configured for memory, field
              sensors, magnetic amplifiers, and magnetic logic, which can, in turn,
              miniaturize electronics and greatly reduce power consumption for a wide variety
              of applications. The fundamental GMR tunneling device consists of two
              ferromagnetic films separated by a very thin ((20 () insulating layer. The
              tunneling current depends on the relative magnetic states of the magnetic
              layers in a fashion similar to that indicated by recent work on GMR materials.
              For the tunneling transistor, an additional metal line is used to produce the
              magnetic field required to modulate the magnetic states of the two magnetic
              layers. Characterization of device current with respect to applied voltage,
              material properties and film thicknesses, and magnetic states will be used to
              refine an existing model. The tunneling transistor will be breadboarded to
              illustrate memory operation, magnetic field sensing, magnetic amplification,
              and magnetic logic.
