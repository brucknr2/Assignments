Abstract    :
              Due to the environmental and health-related hazards of airborne VOC emissions,
              Federal regulations will require improved VOC control technologies.
              Photocatalytic oxidation using UV illuminated titania catalysts has
              demonstrated the capability of destroying a wide range of organics, in
              particular halogenated compounds. Many bench scale reactor designs have been
              tested and show promise in some applications but are characterized by
              relatively poor light utilization and limited air treatment capacities. The
              proposed reactor design, which incorporates a suspended catalyst reactor
              combined with a ceramic filtration system for catalyst recycle, is very easily
              scaleable to high flow rates found in many VOC applications. The reactor design
              is a simple plug flow reactor in which suspended titania catalyst is
              periodically illuminated in the presence of VOC contaminated air. The suspended
              titania particulates are filtered using chemically durable, high efficiency,
              backpulsable ceramic filters which have a very high packing density. The
              resulting systems are very compact and allow the recycle of high activity
              suspended catalysts back to the photocatalytic reactor.
