Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will endeavor to develop
              and demonstrate the viability of a graphical database interface to facilitate
              young children's exploration of the sciences. This will be accomplished through
              the design and development of a database of North American animals and the
              construction of a graphical interface that allows pre-readers and low skill
              readers to conduct searches. The database will consist of multimedia content
              and will reside on a CD ROM. The sophistication of the searching routines will
              allow for the continued use of the product as the users' skills develop.
              Specific objectives to be accomplished in the course of the Phase I research
              include:  identify and develop appropriate database content and category labels
              for use by children in ages 5 to 10;  identify and develop appropriate graphics
              to represent database categories and actions;  produce the audio file necessary
              for communication with the students using the database (these will be used in
              the `audio on` mode only);  construct a software interface (using the
              components listed above) and link it to the database;  train teachers and
              students to use the database;  evaluate the graphical interface to determine
              usability, influence on patterns of use, limitations, and attitudes of teachers
              and students toward the product; and develop a document that summarizes the
              findings of the Phase I research and provides direction for Phase II
              activities.
