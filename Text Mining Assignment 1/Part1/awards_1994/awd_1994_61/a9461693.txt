Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes the development
              of a rapid prototyping system addressing the needs of both designers and
              manufactures. An effective rapid prototyping system is capable of producing
              components suitable for the testing of both form and function. By testing
              components early in the design phase dimensional errors as well as structural
              deficiencies may be identified and corrected. The ability to transition rapidly
              from prototyping to production can also dramatically reduce time it takes to
              introduce new products to market. Research efforts to date have focused on
              either the needs of the designers or manufactures. This novel proposal
              describes an interactive rapid prototyping approach, called Direct Rapid
              Prototyping and Process Generation, that allows for the rapid realization of
              prototype components from their CAD descriptions with the simultaneous
              generation of a CNC tool path program and process plan. Using a joy stick a
              machinist can direct a CNC machine tool controller to accurate|y machine a
              prototype component. Process data generated during this interactive machining
              cycle is then used to create an idealize part program for use by a subsequent
              production cycle.
