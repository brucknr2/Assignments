Abstract    :
              9461971    Hashish    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project will explore a new low-cost atomiztion process for making ultrafine
              powder from metal alloys.  The process uses ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) waterjets
              to atomize molten pre-alloy metals.    Although water is already used in some
              metal atomization processes, this method of using UHP waterjets up to 100,000
              psi represents a significant departure from current methods.  Highly energetic
              waterjets will require much less water, which will result in a nearly dry
              process and a smaller proceqsing system.  UHP nitrogen jets will also be
              explored.    The costs of atomization, for production of ultrafine powders, is
              expected to be reduced due to compactness of the equipment and to the high
              efficiency and high yields of the process.  Materials-processing applications,
              among others,in injection molding and ceramic powder operations.
