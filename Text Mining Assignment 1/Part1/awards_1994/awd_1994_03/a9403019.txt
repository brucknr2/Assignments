Abstract    :
              9403019  Park  In this research project, an integrated set of design tools  are
              developed for robotic mechanisms. Closed chain  mechanisms with fewer than six
              degrees of freedom are  designed to match specific task requirements. In
              contrast to  general programmable robots, these robotic mechanisms  possess
              fewer actuators leading to a reduction in overall  costs. The design  process
              matches the workspace of the  robotic mechanism to the desired task envelope.
              The  resulting robotic mechanism provides new capabilities in  automation that
              matches the goals of high performance and  low cost. The design tool integrates
              local and global  kinematic design procedures, dynamic analysis of closed 
              chains, and motion planning and optimization of parallel  robot systems.  ***
