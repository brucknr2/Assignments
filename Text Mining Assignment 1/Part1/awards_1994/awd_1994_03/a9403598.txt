Abstract    :
              9403598  Canic       This award supports mathematical research focusing on 
              solutions of nonlinear systems of conservation laws.  The  investigation has
              two goals.  The first is to understand the  structure of solutions of Riemann
              problems for a two-dimensional  system of conservation laws that model weak
              shack reflection.   The second is to elucidate the physical admissibility of 
              shockwave solutions of one-dimensional systems.  The reflection  of weak shack
              waves has been extensively studied both  experimentally and numerically, but
              the corresponding  two-dimensional Riemann problems for the compressible Euler 
              equations are intractable on a theoretical level.  This work will  consider
              solutions of the unsteady small disturbance equation  that arises in an
              asymptotic limit of the Euler system.  In the  study of one-dimensional systems
              of conservation laws, the  physical admissibility of shock waves is a central
              question.  A  recent study of stability of viscous-admissible shock waves for 
              quadratic conservation laws under generic two-parameter  perturbations.  These
              results use the theory of unfoldings of  vector fields within the framework of
              the fundamental wave  manifold.  In this project, work will be done to extend
              these  results to perturbations within the three-parameter family that  arises
              naturally in this context.       The study of wave phenomena and shocks is
              represented  mathematically by partial differential equations or systems of 
              such equations.  The equations reflect certain physical  (conservation) laws
              which govern the solutions.  The mathematical  and numerical analysis of these
              solutions is the basis for  studies supported by this grant.  ***
