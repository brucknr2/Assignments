Abstract    :
              9403395    An improved understanding of the systematics of mantle circulation 
              is a high scientific priority in solid earth geophysics.  By  mapping the areal
              distribution of crustal compositions over key  areas of ocean floor,
              quantitative information about the size,  composition, and distribution of
              mantle reservoirs, variations in  mantle temperatures, the efficiency of
              convective stirring in the  mantle, and the longevity of mantle reservoirs can
              be obtained.   One very important problem of this type, which can be addressed
              by  surficial sampling and crustal drilling, concerns the origin and  evolution
              of the distinctive isotopic and geochemical signature of  the Indian Ocean
              spreading centers are isotopically distinct from  those of the Pacific.  A
              unique and sharp boundary between Pacific  and isotopic provinces has been
              identified within the Australian-  Antartic Discordance along the spreading
              ridge.    The objective of the present project is to map this boundary away 
              from the ridge crest, since limited available data tends to  indicate a
              westward migration of the boundary over time.  Seismic  reflection, gravity and
              magnetic data and dredge samples will be  collected in the off-axis area during
              a 40 day research cruise in  early 1996.  These data will also provide
              site-survey information  in support of a proposal to the Ocean Drilling Program
              to sample  old crust in an attempt to map the history of the boundary.  The 
              project involves scientists from the University of Washington,  Oregon State
              University, and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.
