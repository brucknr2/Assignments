Abstract    :
              Abstract - Yin - 9403193    Automatic systems widely employed in industry
              consist of many interdependent working parts which are individually subject to
              malfunction or failure originating from mechanical or physical changes which
              may be internal or external to the system.  These faults or failures may cause
              product degradation, equipment damage, process stoppage or a catastrophe
              involving economic loss, environmental damage or the loss of human lives.  The
              detection, identification and prediction of faults during real time operation
              of a dynamic system is also known as a fault detection, diagnosis and isolation
              (FDI) process.  The aim of this research is the development and study of
              on-line FDI techniques.    Two detection schemes, an extended statistical
              approach and a method based on stochastic approximation and kernel estimation
              will be studied for their applicability.  The extended statistical approach is
              an integrated method of analytical redundancy and an on-line statistical
              procedure.  An input-output model will be used for residual generation.  Both a
              traditional probability ratio test and a test based upon a confidence region
              approach will be used for decision making.  An algorithm based on stochastic
              approximation and kernel estimation has been developed and will be employed for
              fault detection.     This is a Research Planning Grant consisting of computer
              simulation studies.  If successful, it will be followed by experimental
              validation of the algorithms that are developed.
