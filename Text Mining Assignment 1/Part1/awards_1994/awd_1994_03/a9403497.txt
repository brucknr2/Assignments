Abstract    :
              9403497  Nolen  Colgate University  With funding from the Organic Dynamics
              Program Professor Nolen of Colgate University will construct using
              self-assembly procedures structurally well-defined supramolecular complexes
              based upon triply hydrogen bonded associations. A primary goal is the synthesis
              of a self-assembled macrocyclic structure containing six components that is
              called a supramolecular hexnut. Undergraduates will be involved in the
              synthesis and characterization of these compounds and their properties will be
              studied by NMR, UV/vis, fluorescence,vapor phase osmometry, and gel-permeation
              chromatography.    A variety of large, complex organic compounds will be made
              that have the unique properties of association by interactions that are called
              non-covalent bonds. These structures will mimic the behavior of molecules like
              DNA that also associate through non-covalent bonds. An understanding of this
              non-covalent interaction will allow scientists to design new compounds that can
              self replicate and enhance understanding of biochemical processes including
              energy transfer, replication, and enzyme catalysis.
