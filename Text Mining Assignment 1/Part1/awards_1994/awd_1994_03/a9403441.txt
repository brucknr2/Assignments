Abstract    :
              9403441  Zhu    It is proposed to perform an in-depth mechanistic study of the 
              quantum tunneling diffusion of hydrogen on metals.  The  experimental technique
              used is the method of linear optical  diffraction to monitor the decay of
              hydrogen on nickel and copper.   It is proposed to (1) establish tunneling
              diffusion rates in the  thermodynamic zero coverage limit over a wide
              temperature range;  (2) explore the effect of immobile surface disorders on the
               tunneling process; and (3) determine the effect of different  quantum
              statistics for hydrogen and deuterium.    % % % %    The method of
              laser-induced desorption is used to create density  gratings of hydrogen on
              metals and use an optical diffraction  technique to probe the time evolution of
              these gratings.  The  method will allow a study of the transport of hydrogen
              along metal  surfaces over wide ranges of temperature, hydrogen coverage and 
              surface conditions.  It is planned to determine the mechanisms  which control
              the diffusion of hydrogen on metal surfaces.  The  results may shed light on
              the transport of hydrogen atoms along  grain boundaries in polycrystalline
              metals and alloys frequently  used in hydrogen purification and hydrogen
              battery technology and  in hydrogen embrittlement research.  ***
