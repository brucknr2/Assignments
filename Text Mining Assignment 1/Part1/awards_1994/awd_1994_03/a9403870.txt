Abstract    :
              9403870  Yue       The research covers several topics in dynamical systems 
              theory and ergodicity as to applied to Riemannian manifolds of  negative
              curvature. Rigidity questions will be pursued. The  research has potential
              applications to chaos in dynamical systems  and entropy problems in
              mathematical physics.  ***
