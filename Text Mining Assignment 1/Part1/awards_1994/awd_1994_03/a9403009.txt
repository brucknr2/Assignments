Abstract    :
              Partial support is provided for the acquisition of a  scientific computing
              system for the Wake Forest University  Physics and Chemistry departments. The
              primary use of this  facility would be to support the departments' research in 
              theoretical condensed matter physics, quantum chemistry, and  quantum field
              theory in curved space. At present these  departments operate a system
              consisting of two Convex C-120  vectorizing minisupercomputers. The proposed
              new system will  replace these obsolete computers with a cluster of the  latest
              RISC superscalar processors. The problems to be  studied include: 1) density
              functional investigation of  surface reconstruction and of electron tunneling;
              2)  nonlinear effects in the dynamics of structural phase  transitions; 3)
              point defect structures in solids; 4)  effects of quantum fields on black hole
              spacetimes; and 5)  quantum chemical investigation of atmospheric molecular 
              species. The computer configuration to be purchased is a  cluster of
              Hewlett-Packard workstations, configured into a  Meta-system by Convex. The
              system consists of the following  hardware: four HP 9000/735 computational
              nodes each with 128  Megabytes of memory and a 1 Gigabyte internal disk; 20 
              Gigabyte of external disk storage; an additional HP 9000/735  with smaller
              memory and disk for system administration.  Convex packages the HP workstations
              into a single unit and  provides software that unifies the system operation and
               includes a library of highly optimized scientific  subroutines.
