Abstract    :
              9403527  Adams       The scope of the research entails several projects in the 
              area of metric rigidity theory on foliated manifolds. The main  interest will
              focus around geometric-analytic techniques in the  longitudinal direction and
              ergodicity techniques in the  transverse directions respectively of the
              foliation. This  research has potential applications to other areas of 
              differential geometry and dynamical systems.  ***
