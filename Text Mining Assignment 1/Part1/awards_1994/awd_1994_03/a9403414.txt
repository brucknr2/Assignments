Abstract    :
              This research is on compiled simulation of synchronous and  asynchronous
              circuits.  A digital logic simulation algorithm,  called the Inversion
              Algorithm, is being investigated.  This is a  very efficient algorithm, yet
              capable of simulating any digital  circuit.  Basic extensions are being made to
              the algorithm.  These  involve including unit and multi-delay timing models, a
              logic model  with unknown value, new gates, new types of functions, as well as 
              bit-parallel simulation.  Further, it is being redesigned so as to  reduce both
              the complexity of the simulation and the number of  events processed during
              simulation.  Additional activities include  extending the existing model to a
              multiple processor  implementation, and to handle asynchronous sequential
              circuits.   Application of the Inversion Algorithm to hierarchical simulation 
              and incremental compilation is being explored.
