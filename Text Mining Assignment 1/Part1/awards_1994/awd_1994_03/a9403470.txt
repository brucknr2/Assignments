Abstract    :
              9403470  Taylor         The objective of this proposal is to develop a
              state-of-the-  art imaging system that utilizes a new type of CCD detector to 
              obtain two-dimensional temperature and intensity maps of short  period gravity
              waves.  The instrument will be capable of up to  10,000 simultaneous
              measurements of mesospheric temperature with  high signal-to-noise ratio.  The
              measurements will be made over a  large area of sky and will have sufficient
              spatial and temporal  resolution to investigate short period gravity waves in 
              unprecedented detail.    ***
