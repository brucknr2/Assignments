Abstract    :
              9403627  Schwartz  The focus of this research is the development of soluble, 
              "early" transition metal complex reagents and surface-bound  organometallic
              reagents.  In the former area, low-valent  titanium and zirconium salen
              derivatives will be prepared that  will employ helical chirality to guide
              organic transformations.  In the latter area, oxide surface-bound
              organometallics will be  used to catalyze the partial oxidation of alkenes.   
              With this reneawl award, the Synthetic Organic Program is  supporting the
              research of Dr. Jeffrey Schwartz of the  Department of Chemistry at Princeton
              University.  Professor  Schwartz will focus his work on understanding
              reactivity of  transition metal complexes so that new reagents can be 
              rationally developed for use in organic synthesis.
