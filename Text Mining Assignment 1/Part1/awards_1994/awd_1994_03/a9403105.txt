Abstract    :
              9403105  Miller  Dr. Scott J. Miller has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral 
              Research Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Miller's doctoral degree  was from
              Harvard University under the supervision of Professor  David Evans.  Dr. Miller
              will continue research at the  California Institute of Technology under the
              supervision of  Professor Robert Grubbs. Dr. Miller's postdoctoral fellowship 
              will enhance his synthetic organic skills by providing him with  experience in
              organometallic catalysis as applied to olefin  metathesis. Longer term, he will
              apply his organometallic  training to the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of
              alpha-amino  acids based on the use of chiral rhodium carbonyl complexes.   
              The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is  viewed as an
              important infrastructural program designed to  broaden the knowledge and
              experience of new Ph.D.s and attract  them into meaningful careers in
              contemporary chemical research  and teaching.  ***
