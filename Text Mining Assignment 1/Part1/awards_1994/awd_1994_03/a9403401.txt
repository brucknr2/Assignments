Abstract    :
              9403401  Hagedorn       Title:  Mathematical Studies in Quantum Mechanics    The
              PI plans to study two types of problems in mathematical  quantum mechanics. The
              first type of problem involves studying  periodic Schroedinger operators that
              are perturbed by potentials  that are localized in space. These perturbations
              give rise to  discrete eigenvalues in the gaps of the pure crystal's electron 
              energy spectrum. The PI plans to develop numerical algorithms for  the
              calculation of these impurity levels and to study their  properties. He plans
              to extend known results about such systems  from one dimension to n dimensions.
              Among the properties to be  studied are eigenvalue trapping, cascading, and
              threshold  behavior. The second type of problem involves study of the 
              time-dependent Schroedinger equation for molecular systems. Some  of the
              problems to be studied are: 1) Development of a model to  describe
              non-adiabatic effects caused by avoided crossings of  electron energy levels.
              2) Interactions of molecules with  electromagnetic radiation. 3) Computation of
              high order  Born-Oppenheimer correction terms. 4) Study of the validity and 
              high energy behavior of the impact parameter model in molecular  scattering. 
              The PI  plans to study several mathematical problems  in quantum mechanics.
              Part of this project involves the study of  a model that describes the energy
              levels of electrons in crystals  that have impurities. These levels determine
              the colors of some  crystals, such as rubies and sapphires. The rest of the
              project  involves the study of chemical reaction dynamics at the molecular 
              level.
