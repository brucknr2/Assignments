Abstract    :
              9403629  Chen       The research entails the study of existence and regularity 
              of classes of partial differential equations arising from the  variational
              principles derived from harmonic maps of Riemannian  manifolds. The case of
              non-compact complete Riemannian manifolds  will receive particular attention
              including those cases where  conical singularities are present. The research
              has potential  application to mathematical physics and liquid crystals in 
              materials theory.  ***
