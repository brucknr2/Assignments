Abstract    :
              9403666  Bauer       The research proposed encompasses much of nuclear  physics
              and extends into particle physics and astrophysics.  Some of the many proposed
              topics include an analysis of  chaos in nuclear deformation and structure,
              fragmentation,  pion correlations and interferometry in heavy-ion  collisions,
              hadronization at RHIC energies, studies of  nuclear effective interactions, and
              applications to nuclear  astrophysics.  ***
