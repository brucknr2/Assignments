Abstract    :
              9403652  Lott     The research entails several problems in index theory and 
              analysis of the spectrum of pseudodifferential operators on  manifolds.
              Topological questions relating to the index of these  operators on possibly
              singular spaces will be addressed. The  research has potential applications to
              other areas of  mathematics, quantum theory and solid state physics.  ***
