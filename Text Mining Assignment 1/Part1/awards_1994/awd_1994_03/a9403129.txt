Abstract    :
              9403129  Geiger  Dr. Cherie L. Geiger has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral 
              Research Fellowship in Chemistry.  Dr. Geiger received her  doctoral degree
              from the University of South Florida under the  supervision of Professor
              Christian Clausen. Dr. Geiger will  continue research at the University of
              Central Florida under  the sponsorship of Professor Debra Reinhart. Her
              postdoctoral  research will focus on the mechanism of transport and analysis 
              of chemicals interned at municipal solid waste landfills.  Elements of the
              research will include computer modeling of gas  generation and transport,
              improved sampling methods, and  development of GC and CG-MS analytical methods.
              Longer term,  she plans to apply her postdoctoral training to study  subsurface
              contamination from agricultural chemicals.    The Postdoctoral Research
              Fellowships in Chemistry Program is  viewed as an important infrastructural
              program designed to  broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and
              attract  them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research  and
              teaching.
