Abstract    :
              9403730  Colgate  This project deals with the haptic display of rigid body 
              dynamic systems. A haptic interface allows an operator to  manipulate and feel
              computer-generated environments in  applications  such as flight simulation,
              rapid prototyping  systems and physical therapy. During the project activity, 
              rigid body dynamic systems featuring unilateral and  bilateral constraints are
              investigated using a network  method approach for real-time solution. Such
              methods  guarantee passivity and exploit a low-level of parallelism  to achieve
              real-time integration rates for stiff dynamic  systems. Transputers are
              employed as basic computational  elements for laboratory implementation using a
              state-of-the-  art four degree of freedom haptic display device.  ***
