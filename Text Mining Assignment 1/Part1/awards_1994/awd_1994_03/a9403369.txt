Abstract    :
              9403369  Bolden      This award is under the International Junior Investigator 
              and Postdoctoral Fellows Program, which enables U.S.  scientists and engineers
              to conduct three to twelve months  of research abroad at research centers of
              proven excellence.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint 
              research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities,  expertise and
              experimental conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month
              postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Daphne A. Bolden to work with Dr. Marina 
              Bentivoglio at the University of Verona's Institutes of  Human Anatomy and
              Histology.    This research proposes to test the hypothesis that an 
              interaction exists between the sympathetic and sensory  division of the
              peripheral nervous systems.  An  understanding of such an interaction would
              provide insights  into disorders of the autonomic nervous system in which 
              degeneration is specific to one population of neurons, yet  consequences are
              seen in both divisions.  The proposed  studies are designed to examine this
              interaction by  employing a model of sympathetic neuronal degeneration.  ***
