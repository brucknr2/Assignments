Abstract    :
              9403458  Zweifel       The Wigner Poisson System of equations describes electron
               plasmas in a regime where quantum effects are important, for  example semi-
              conductor devices including field-effect  transistors, Josephson junctions,
              hetero-junctions, quantum  "dots" and the like. A self- consistent field
              approach is  employed leading to pseudo-differential equations which in the 
              classical limit tend to the ordinary Vlasov- Poisson system. The  problem we
              propose to study includes existence and uniqueness of  solutions, their
              regularity and asymptotic properties and  developement of numerical methods
              appropriate to the treatment of  practical devices, as well as studies of the
              classical limiting  procedure.   The studies to be carried out under this
              proposal  are intended to lead to an understanding of methods applicable to 
              many practical systems of interest in physics and engineering,  especially
              systems of small size, because that is where quantum  effects become important.
              Another important facet of our work  will be to develop methods for obtaining
              quantum corrections to  systems which are quasi-classical in nature, since such
               calculations will provide great economy in computer time and  cost, vis-a-vis
              a full quantum description. Such calculations  have been carried out by some
              researchers, but without any proof  or even reasonable grounds to believe that
              such a procedure is  mathematically valid.
