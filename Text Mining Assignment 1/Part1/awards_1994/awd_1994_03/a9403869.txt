Abstract    :
              9403869  Wensley       Research in theoretical particle physics will focus on
              the  phenomena of quark confinement.  Quarks are the fundamental  particles
              which are the constituents of nucleons.  Experimental  evidence indicates that
              quarks are confined that is, they are so  tightly bound within the nucleon that
              they cannot exist as free  and separate particles.  Calculations of the forces
              between  quarks will be performed using numerical computer simulations.  These
              calculations will shed light on the physical mechanism that  causes the
              confinement of quarks.  Magnetic monopoles, the  magnetic analogue of electric
              charges, have been proposed as the  confinement mechanism.  The results of this
              project will provide  a stringent test of the magnetic monopole confinement
              scenario.  Determining how quarks are bound within nucleons is crucial for  our
              understanding of the fundamental particles in nature.  ***
