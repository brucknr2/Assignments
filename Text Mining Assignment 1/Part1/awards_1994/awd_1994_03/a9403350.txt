Abstract    :
                9403350  Zia  The objective of the workshop is to provide an opportunity for 
              leading researchers in this important and rapidly advancing  technical field to
              assess the state-of-the-art of the technology in  Europe, the Pacific Rim, and
              North America.  Based on the  assessment of the current status of the
              technology,  the workshop  participants will identify the research needs to
              further advance  the technology and accelerate its acceptance into practice.
