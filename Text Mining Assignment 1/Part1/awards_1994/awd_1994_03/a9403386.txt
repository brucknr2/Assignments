Abstract    :
                  9403386  SILVER                              Abstract    Although a great
              deal of research has addressed how people cope  with traumatic life
              expreiences, little is known about the  interaction and development of
              cognitive, social, and emotional  responses to trauma over time.    This
              research will document the variation in early response to a  traumatic event
              and identify the early predictors of long-term  adjustment to trauma.  Victims
              of the Southern California  firestorm in Laguna Beach and Malibu were
              interviewed within 48  hours of their return to their homes post-evacuation.  
              Three  follow-up assessments of the participants will be conducted, with  the
              final data to be collected 6 months post-trauma.    This research will
              represent the first attempt to recruit and  follow disaster victims
              longitudinally.  The findings of this  study will contribute to a current
              on-going debate about patterns  of coping with traumatic life events.
