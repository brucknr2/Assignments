Abstract    :
              This project is a study of a two level interconnection networks,  called
              dBcubes, in which hypercube subgraphs are interconnected by  a de Bruijn graph.
               The purported advantage of this scheme is  scalability.  The hypercubes
              provide high local connectivity, while  the de Bruijn graph allows a
              combination of fixed degree and low  diameter.  The goal of this project is to
              determine whether the  study of interconnection networks of this type is
              relevant to  practical computer architectures.  Topics to be investigated 
              include replacement of either the hypercubes or the de Bruijn graph  with
              simpler graphs, a study of wormhole routing, algorithm  embedding, and several
              implementation issues.
