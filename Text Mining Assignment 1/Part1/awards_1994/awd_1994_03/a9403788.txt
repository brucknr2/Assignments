Abstract    :
              9403788  Anderson       The research concerns the study of the variational
              bicomplex  and its applications to differential equations and conservation 
              laws in mathematical physics using differential-geometric and  topological
              techniques. Particular attention will be paid to the  Euler-Lagrange complex in
              the setting of the modern theory of the  calculus of variations. The methods
              are applicable to analyzing  the Einstein vacuum equations. They are also
              applicable to to  many systems of partial differential equations which arise in
               mathematical physics and theoretical mechanics.  ***
