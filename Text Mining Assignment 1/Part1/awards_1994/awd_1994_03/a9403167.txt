Abstract    :
              9403167  Kozlowski  Dr. Marisa C. Kozlowski has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral
               Research Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Kozlowski received her  doctoral degree
              from the University of California at Berkeley  under the supervision of
              Professor Paul Bartlett. Dr. Kozlowski  will continue research at Harvard
              University under the  sponsorship of Professor David Evans. Her postdoctoral
              research  will focus on the design and development of titanium(IV)  catalysts
              to effect asymmetric aldol condensations. Longer  term, she will employ
              computer programs to facilitate the  rational design of chiral ligands to
              effect asymmetric  induction over a broad range of synthetic transformations.  
               The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is  viewed as an
              important infrastructural program designed to  broaden the knowledge and
              experience of new Ph.D.s and attract  them into meaningful careers in
              contemporary chemical research  and teaching.  ***
