Abstract    :
              The Cariaco Basin is a unique locality to study the low-latitude  counterpart of
              climate change.  The PI will study the varve  sediments of the Basin to
              investigate tropical paleoenvironmental  changes in key intervals over century
              and millennial time scales  for the past 12.6 Ky., including the Little Ice Age
              and the onset  of industrial revolution.  Additional objective is to study
              abrupt  climate change associated with last deglaciation.  The PIs will use 
              the varved sediment cores collected during a 1990 cruise.
