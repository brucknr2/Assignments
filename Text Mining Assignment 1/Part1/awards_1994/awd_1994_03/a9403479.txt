Abstract    :
              9403479  GOMEZ       Overbank sedimentation caused by major floods is an 
              important, but not well understood process. In order for there to  be a testing
              of existing models and the construction of new  models, it is necessary to
              collect better data. The upper  Mississippi River floods of the summer of 1993
              provide a special  opportunity to collect such data. This Small Grants for 
              Exploratory Research project is designed to collect systemmatic  samples of
              overbank sedimentation from unleveed areas of the  floodplain as well as an
              area which was inundated following a  levee breach. Samples will be collected
              from two sites which will  enable the investigators to map variations in the
              thickness and  particle size distribution of overbank deposits associated with 
              the flood. These data will enable the investigators to determine  the
              relationship of floodplain topography and vegetation to  observed patterns of
              scour and deposition and to compare patterns  of erosion and sedimentation on
              the leveed and unleveed parts of  the floodplain. Data will be organized in a
              geographic  information system in order to facilitate further research.      
              This project will provide a timely and unusual data set and  analysis that can
              be used to test the integrity of existing  sedimentation models and that will
              likely lead to new  understanding of the process of sedimentation.  ***
