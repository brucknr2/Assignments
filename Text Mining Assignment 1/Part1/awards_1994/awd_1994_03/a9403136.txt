Abstract    :
              9403136  Leighton  Dr. James L. Leighton has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral 
              Research Fellowship in Chemistry.  Dr. Leighton received his  doctoral degree
              form Harvard University under the supervision  of Professor David Evans.  Dr.
              Leighton will continue research  at Harvard University under the sponsorship of
              Professor Eric  Jacobsen. His postdoctoral research will focus on the 
              development of methodology for the rapid and efficient  evaluation of ligands
              for asymmetric catalytic processes,  specifically the (salen) Mn(III)-
              catalyzed epoxidation of  olefins.  Longer term he plans to apply his expertise
              in  asymmetric catalysis to stereoselective rhodium-catalyzed  hydroformylation
              processes.    The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is 
              viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to  broaden the
              knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract  them into meaningful
              careers in contemporary chemical research  and teaching.
