Abstract    :
              9403908  Vignale  This theoretical grant involves the development of a current- 
              density functional theory for many-electron systems in magnetic  fields and its
              application to artificial microstructures in strong  magnetic fields.  Specific
              systems to be studied include: (i)  quasi-two-dimensional quantum dots; (ii)
              quasi-three-dimensional  wide parabolic quantum wells; (iii) quantum wires and
              rings.  %%%  Conventional density functional theory which has been so
              successful  in describing the electronic structure of many physical systems is 
              unable to account for the presence of strong magnetic fields in a 
              self-consistent manner.  This work will develop a current-density  functional
              theory which incorporates the magnetic field from the  beginning.  This will
              enable many strongly correlated many-electron  systems to be modeled
              accurately.  Initial applications will be to  mesoscopic systems such as
              quantum dots, wires nd rings which occur  in microelectronics.  ***
