Abstract    :
              The investigator develops the theory for the generalnonlinear  rescaling
              principle for constrained optimization.  Based on this  principle, he finds
              theoretically well-grounded and numerically  efficient methods for solving
              large-scale constrained  optimization problems.  Constrained optimization
              problems arise in all areas  ofscientific, technological, and commercial
              activities.  The  problem is to choose values of parameters, subject to certain
               limits on their values, so as to make some function of the  parameters take on
              an extreme value.  For instance, one might try  to locate warehouses so as to
              minimize the costs of shipping  items to individual distribution sites.  Or one
              might choose the  placement of structural members to maximize the strength of
              the  structure subject to weight constraints.  Problems like these can  involve
              thousands of parameters and tens of thousands of  constraints.  The
              investigator develops and studies efficient and  numerically stable methods for
              large-scale optimization problems.   The ability to solve such problems is
              critical in optimal  structural design, forecasting, network optimization,
              optimal  control, economics, and finance communication problems.
