Abstract    :
                    This award will support creation of a publicly available,  easy to use,
              centralized directory for molecular biology  software and data.  Specifically
              it will support upgrade of  the computers and software supporting the
              University of  Houston Gene-Server and expansion of its database to include 
              current information on software and data available for use  by molecular
              biologists.  The resulting database will  provide a network-accessible,
              centralized source for  information on molecular biology software and data. 
              The  database will support a variety of access mechanisms  (Mosaic, Gopher, FTP
              and electronic mail), so that even  researchers with restricted access to the
              Internet can use  its information.  Production of the "yellow pages" of 
              molecular biology software and data will involve creation of  software tools
              which automatically scan a large number of  potential information sources and
              retrieve copies of  relevant information for inclusion in the "yellow pages" 
              database.
