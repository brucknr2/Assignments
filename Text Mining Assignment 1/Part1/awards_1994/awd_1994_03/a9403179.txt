Abstract    :
              9403179  Booksh  Dr. Karl S. Booksh has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral 
              Research Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Booksh received his  doctoral degree from
              the University of Washington under the  supervision of Professor Bruce
              Kowalski. Dr. Booksh will  continue research at the University of South
              Carolina under the  sponsorship of Professor Michael Myrick.  His postdoctoral 
              research will provide him with the techniques and knowledge  necessary to
              design and construct environmental and process  sensors. Longer term, he plans
              to apply his knowledge of  chemometrics to the development and calibration of
              in situ  sensors that rely on mathematical and physical separation of  the
              analyte signal from the background signal. With appropriate  probe design and
              proper use of calibration algorithms, sensors  will be built that optimize
              selectivity, dynamic range and  speed.    The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships
              in Chemistry is viewed as  an important infrastructural program designed to
              broaden the  knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract them into 
              meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and  teaching.
