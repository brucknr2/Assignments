Abstract    :
              9403887  MCCrory       The group of researchers will be working on several
              projects  in areas of geometric analysis, Hamiltonian systems and algebraic 
              geometry. Many of the projects have potential applications to  other branches
              of mathematics including number theory, Lie groups  and certain topics in
              mathematical physics including the theory  of solitons and its applications.
