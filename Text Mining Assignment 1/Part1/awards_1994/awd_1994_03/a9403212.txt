Abstract    :
              9403212    Hansen        This award is under the International Junior
              Investigator  and Postdoctoral Fellows Program, which enables U.S.  scientists
              and engineers to conduct three to twelve months  of research abroad at research
              centers of proven excellence.  The program's awards provide opportunities for
              joint  research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities,  expertise
              and experimental conditions abroad.        This award will support a
              twelve-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Karen L. Hansen to work with
              Professor Iain A.  MacLeod of Strathclyde University in Glasgow.    Dr. Hansen
              proposes to study existing approaches to the  development of design criteria by
              clients, engineers, and  architects within a European context; create a
              framework for  a computerized design criteria knowledge base, including a 
              method for checking design criteria against completed  design; and form a basis
              for the development of a  comprehensive research program on methodology for the
               creation and use of design criteria.  The benefits of  creating a
              knowledge-based computer system will be a  formalization of knowledge
              acquisition methods used by  European firms, identification of the content of
              design  criteria used by them, dissemination of this information to  the
              European and U.S. building industry, and improved  methodology for handling
              requirements leading to higher  quality design output.  ***
