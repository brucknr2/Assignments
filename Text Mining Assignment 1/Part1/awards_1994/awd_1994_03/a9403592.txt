Abstract    :
              9403592  Skelton  This project develops analytical methods for predicting the 
              dynamic response of civil engineering structures, and new  structure design
              concepts to improve the dynamic response.  The upper bounds on the dynamic
              response for structures with  some modeling uncertainties, and with some
              uncertainties in  the static and transient loads will be established.  Safe 
              performance for a variety of design goals, including the  ability to withstand
              worst case wind loads and earthquake  excitations, in the presence of a
              specified set of component  failures will be ensured.  Finally, structure
              design with  control design as opposed to existing procedures which add 
              control after a structure is designed, will be integrated.  This research will
              lead to a systematic theory of design for  civil engineering structures,
              complete with a CAD  workstation environment integrating identification, model 
              reduction, control design, and structure design.  The  improvements in
              structural design could be significant when  the two disciplines (structures
              and controls) are integrated  into a single design process  ***
