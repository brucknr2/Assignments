Abstract    :
              Electronic interactions in metals can produce a rich variety of  interesting
              phenomena including superconductivity, magnetic  order, heavy fermion behavior,
              non-Fermi liquid behavior, Kondo  effect, and valence fluctuations, many of
              which are not well  understood. Valuable information needed for developing an 
              understanding of the microscopic interactions that produce these  phenomena can
              be obtained from measurements of the properties of  materials that exhibit
              these phenomena at low temperatures. This  award provides support for a
              dilution refrigerator (DR) which  will be used for measurements of low
              temperature properties of  strongly correlated electron systems. The DR system
              will provide  a base temperature of less than 10 milliKelvins with a cooling 
              power of 250 microwatts at 100 milliKelvins, and a large amount  of
              experimental access. Several accessories will be added to the  basic system,
              including resistance thermometry for measuring the  temperature of the sample
              mounted below the mixing chamber, and a  9 tesla superconducting magnet system
              for measurement in high  magnetic fields.    Studies in the milliKelvin range
              are especially important for  some materials with very low energy scales
              including heavy  fermion superconductors, low ordering temperature magnets,
              heavy  fermion and Kondo compounds, and those exhibiting time-dependent 
              phenomena associated with quantum tunneling. Very often,  investigations to
              ever lower temperatures yield unexpected  behavior, revealing new lower energy
              scales associated with the  many-body ground state. These studies are of
              fundamental  scientific interest and are also of importance in the  development
              of useful materials for industrial applications.
