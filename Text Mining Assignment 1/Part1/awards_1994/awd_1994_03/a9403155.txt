Abstract    :
              9403155  Hammond  Dr. Paula T. Hammond has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral 
              Research Fellowship in Chemistry.  Dr. Hammond received her  doctoral degree
              from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  under the supervision of
              Professor Michael Rubner. Dr. Hammond  will continue research at Harvard
              University under the  sponsorship of Professor George Whitesides. Her
              postdoctoral  research will focus on the use of self-assembled monolayers to 
              pattern the deposition of metals on surfaces, directed towards  the development
              of a grating structure that responds to  electrochemical potential with the
              diffraction of light. Longer  term, she will apply patterned self-assembled
              monolayers to the  development of optically functional devices such as optical 
              waveguides and liquid crystal devices.    The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships
              in Chemistry Program is  viewed as an important infrastructural program
              designed to  broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract 
              them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research  and teaching.
