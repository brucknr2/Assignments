Abstract    :
              9403244  Fox      This research aims to develop a system to be used as a model 
              for testing fundamental genetic hypotheses dealing with the  evolution of 
              insect diet breadth, including host shifts and/or  expansions.  Evolutionary
              mechanisms responsible for diet breadth  will be sought using two sibling
              species of seed-feeding beetle,  Stator beali (a specialist restricted to the
              host plant  Chloroleucon ebano) and Stator limbatus (a feeding generalist 
              associated with more than fifty host plant species).  The work  involves
              documenting patterns of intra- and inter-population  variation in oviposition
              preference and host suitability, and  subsequently examination of genetic and
              environmental sources of  this variation using laboratory and field
              experimentation.  %%%  Performing a genetic analysis of mechanisms responsible
              for insect  diet breadth is important to understanding sympatric speciation, 
              incorporation of novel host plant species into diet (particularly  for
              introduced pests), maintenance of genetic variation within  natural
              populations, and development of reliable pest control  practices / techniques.
