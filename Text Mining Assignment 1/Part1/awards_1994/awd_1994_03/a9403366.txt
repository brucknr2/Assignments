Abstract    :
              9403366  Green    This action provides $3,000 to support graduate students to
              attend  and present pertinent scientific research on ceramic materials at  the
              Gordon Conference on Ceramics, August 14-19, 1994, in New  Hampton, NH.  The
              conference examines the fundamental relationships  between processing,
              structure, and properties with the ultimate aim  of enhancing the properties of
              ceramic materials.  The conference  seeks to integrate the understanding of
              material properties from an  atomistic through to a macroscopic scale. 
              Emphasis is on theory,  processing, nanoscale to macroscale microstructure,
              composites,  property evaluation, and mechanical behavior.  %%%  The conference
              applies the ideas of engineering design to  architecture of ceramic materials
              with the goal of property  improvement.  ***
