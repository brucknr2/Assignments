Abstract    :
              9403601  Hillery       The project consists of two parts.  The first is the 
              fundamental treatment of dispersion, operator ordering in the  Hamiltonian of
              the non-linear optical field.  the second is the  continued study of
              correlations, interferometric measurements and  tests of Bell's inequalities.
