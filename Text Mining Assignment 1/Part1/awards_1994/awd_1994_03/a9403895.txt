Abstract    :
              9403895  Shelton    Technical abstract:  This experimental research program
              focuses on  multinary oxides that display a combination of properties including
               high-temperature superconductivity, long-range magnetic order,  valence
              fluctuations and anisotropy order parameters.  To determine  the intrinsic
              physical properties, the research emphasizes  experiments on high quality
              single crystals.  Three systems form  the core of these studies; namely
              rare-earth barium cuprates, rare-  earth barium niobates, and rare-earth
              strontium niobates.  To  insure consistency and uniformity in interpreting the
              experimental  results, a great variety of complimentary experiments will be 
              performed on the single crystals.    Non-technical abstract:  This experimental
              research program focuses  on three families of materiald that show great
              promise for  technological applications as well as probing the exciting state
              of  high-temperature superconductivity.  Due to the intrinsic  complexity of
              these multi-component materials, great emphasis is  place on using the highest
              quality crystals for this study.  Goals  with practical components include: 
              elemental substitutions to  stabilize the superconducting state against
              fluctuations in  operating environment of the superconducting device; discovery
              and  characterization of materials from the same family suitable as  insulating
              analogs in device fabrication.  ***
