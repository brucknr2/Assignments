Abstract    :
                   The proposed research will continue an investigation of  Poincare-invariant
              light-front models.  Applications will  include the nucleon-nucleon problem,
              including various pion  and rho-meson exchanges, as well as excitation of the
              Delta  resonance, and a calculation of the electromagnetic  properties of the
              deuteron.  Earlier work will be continued  on the study of light-front dynamics
              and manifestly  covariant formulations of strong-interaction dynamics.  ***
