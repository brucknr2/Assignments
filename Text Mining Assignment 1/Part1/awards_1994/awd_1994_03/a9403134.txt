Abstract    :
              9403134  Lieberman  Dr. Marya Lieberman has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral 
              Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Lieberman received her doctoral  degree from the
              University of Washington under the supervision  of Professor Tomikazu Sasaki.
              Dr. Lieberman will continue  research at the California Institute of Technology
              under the  sponsorship of Professor Nathan Lewis. Her postdoctoral  research
              will focus on the semiconductor-electrolyte interface,  specifically on the
              synthesis and characterization of a coating  which, when illuminated, injects
              electrons into the conduction  band of a semiconductor. Longer term, she plans
              to design,  synthesize and characterize at molecular resolution, composite 
              materials consisting of layered metal organophosphonates and  organic spacer
              molecules. These designer solids will find  application in catalysis, molecular
              recognition and signal  transduction.    The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships
              in Chemistry Program is  viewed as an important infrastructural program
              designed to  broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract 
              them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research  and teaching.
