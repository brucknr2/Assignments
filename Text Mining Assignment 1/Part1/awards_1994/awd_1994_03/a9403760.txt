Abstract    :
                                          Abstract    BIR9403760      The Bloomington
              Drosophila Stock Center collects, maintains, and  distributes genetic stocks of
              the fly, Drosophila melanogaster.  The sophisticated genetic tools developed in
              Drosophila over the  past 80 years make this insect a powerful model organisms
              for  biological research.  The collection currently consists of over  5,300
              different genetic stocks including visible, lethal and  sterile mutations
              (about 30% of the collection), chromosome  aberrations (about 36% of the
              total), and marked transposon  insertions (about 34% of holdings).  An
              electronic database is  maintained and distributed, allowing users full access
              to up-to-  date information about stocks available from the collection, and 
              center scientists are available to provide advice on the use of  these
              materials.  The center is heavily used, with close to  16,000 stocks expected
              to be shipped during 1993.  Over 99% of  stocks are used by academia-based
              researchers, about 76% of these  within the US and the remaining 24% spread
              among 33 countries.  This resource preserves valuable research materials for
              the  future, promotes effective use of these tools today, assures that 
              documented strains are readily available to all qualified users,  and relieves
              individual researchers and their grants of the  burden of providing large
              numbers of stocks to colleagues.    This award is jointly supported with the
              National Center for  Research Resouces, the National Institute of General
              Medical  Sciences, and the National Eye Institute of the National  Institutes
              of Health.
