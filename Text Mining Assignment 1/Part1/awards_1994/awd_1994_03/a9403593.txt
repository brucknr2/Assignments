Abstract    :
                                          Abstract    BIR9403593      The purpose of this
              project is to maintain and improve a well-  established, well-characterized
              collection of maize mutants that  have been produced by treating pollen with
              the chemical mutagen,  ethyl methanesulfonate or other mutagenic agents.  Five 
              objectives are proposed: (1) to continue freely sharing this  collection, upon
              request, with all members of the scientific  community; (2) to establish a
              smaller "core: collection of the  most interesting stocks that will be
              maintainable by a single  faculty member here at the University of Missouri;
              (3) to provide  those stocks that have been appropriately characterized, 
              including a duplicate of the core collection; (4) to enhance the  existing
              electronic database by more fully characterizing the  core collection of
              mutants, and to incorporate that information  into the national Maize Genome
              Database (Columbia, MO); and (5)  to ensure that each mutant is available in a
              good, well-  characterized background with a good, reasonably current seed 
              source.
