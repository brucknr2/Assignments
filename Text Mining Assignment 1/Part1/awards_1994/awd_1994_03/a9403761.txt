Abstract    :
              9403761  Ji   The research entails the geometry and analysis of holomorphic 
              mappings on classes of complex manifolds. The latter involves  such questions
              as value distribution and the Jacobian conjecture  for polynomial maps between
              complex Euclidean spaces. The  research has potential applications to other
              areas of mathematics  including algebraic geometry and complex analysis.  ***
