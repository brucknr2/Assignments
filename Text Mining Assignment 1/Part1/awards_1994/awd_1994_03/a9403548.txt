Abstract    :
                   The research covers topics in the geometry and analysis of  planar domains
              and conformal mappings in complex function theory.  The relationship between
              conformal mappings and circle packing  immersions will be pursued.       The
              research has possible applications to complex dynamical  systems and fractals.
              Since the the circle packing problems  involve the geometry of configurative
              systems, the research may  also have possible applications to the initiatives
              of  manufacturing and materials research. Schramm's presence at the 
              institution will benefit the current activities of the resident  group and
              their graduate students.  ***
