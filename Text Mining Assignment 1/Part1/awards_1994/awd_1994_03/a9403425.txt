Abstract    :
              9403425  Gerrish  "Control Methods for Wide Area All-Optical Networks" This
              project  is funded under the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Small 
              Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, which is designed to  provide an
              opportunity for small business, particularly the small  high technology firm,
              to participate in NSF research.  Phase I of  the SBIR program serves as a
              filter to select promising proposals  and determine if the firm can do high
              quality research.  Phase II  is the principal research project.  Phase III is
              the conversion of  the NSF-funded research into commercial applications and 
              technological innovation supported by follow-on private venture  capital or
              other non-federal financing.  This Phase II project  involves investigation of
              a Just-In-Time protocol for control of  all-optical high speed networks.  The
              work includes software design  and simulations to obtain the absolute level of
              performance of the  Just-in-Time protocol in realistic network and traffic
              conditions.   Deliverables are a protocol recommendation, simulation runs and
              the  developed simulation and switch processor software modules.  ***
