Abstract    :
              9403784  Poritz       The topics covered in the research involve moduli problems
               and gauge theory relative to vector bundles over punctured  Riemann surfaces.
              Such notions have potential applications to  aspects of mathematical physics
              involving integrable systems and  soliton theory. Harmonic map techniques will
              be applied to tackle  rigidity questions of actions of lattices on compact
              manifolds.  ***
