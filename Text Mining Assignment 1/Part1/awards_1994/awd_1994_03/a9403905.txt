Abstract    :
              9403905  Zakhar       The scope of research to be undertaken by I. Zakharevich 
              entails the geometry and spectral analysis of the Riemann zeta  function along
              with the direct and inverse scattering transform  with parameters. The research
              is intimately linked with the  theory of differential equations arising in many
              mechanical and  dynamical systems.  ***
