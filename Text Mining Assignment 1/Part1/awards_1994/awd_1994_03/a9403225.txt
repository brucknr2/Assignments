Abstract    :
              9403225  Auerbach       This Small Grant for Exploratory Research will conduct a
               quantitative analysis of ion channel kinetics using higher order  hidden
              markov models (HMM).  Ion channels are proteins that  regulate the electrical
              behavior of cells.  The investigators  will use the HMM method to study these
              channels, and will  simulate these channels on a network of workstations, using
               parallel codes.  This high risk project should help determine the 
              applicability of the use of HMM for understanding ion channel  kinetics.  ***
