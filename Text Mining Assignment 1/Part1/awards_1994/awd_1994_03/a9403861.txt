Abstract    :
              9403861  Alber       The investigator plans to continue research in geometric 
              phases and asymptotics for non-linear equations with  singularities.
              Hamiltonian systems, holonomic constraints and  optical soliton solutions will
              also be considered. The scope of  the research has a number of potential
              applications to such areas  as fiber optics, micromotors and robotic
              engineering.  ***
