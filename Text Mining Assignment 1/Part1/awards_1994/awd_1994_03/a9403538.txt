Abstract    :
              Jacquet       This award funds the continuing work of Professor Herve Jacquet in
              the  Langland's program.  In particular Prof. Jacquet will investigate certain
              period integrals.   The major problem is to classify the automorphic
              representations of a particular group  that are distinguished for a subgroup.  
                  Number Theory is the study of the properties of the whole numbers and is
              the  oldest branch of mathematics. From the beginning problems in number theory
              have  furnished the driving force to creation of new mathematics in almost all
              parts of the  discipline. The Langland's program is a general philosophy that
              connects number theory  with calculus.  Modern number theory is very technical
              and deep, but it has had  astonishing applications in areas like theoretical
              computer science and coding theory.   ***
