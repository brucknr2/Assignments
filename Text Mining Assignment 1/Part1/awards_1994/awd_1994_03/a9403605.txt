Abstract    :
              9402033  Detrick       This project continues work on a multichannel seismic 
              and ocean bottom seismograph study of the southern East  Pacific Rise between
              the Garrett transform and 20 degrees  south.  Questions that will be addressed
              include:  (1) the  significance of the rapid increase in P-wave velocity at the
               base of seismic layer 2A, (2) the physical properties of the  melt lens, (3)
              the dimensions and physical properties of the  low velocity volume in mid and
              lower crust beneath the axial  magma chamber, (4) the nature of Moho in the
              axial region,  and (5) the variation in axial crustal structure across an 
              overlapping spreading center.  ***
