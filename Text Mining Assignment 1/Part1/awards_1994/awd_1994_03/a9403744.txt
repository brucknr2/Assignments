Abstract    :
              9403744  Goodnick  The International Workshop on Computational Electronics will
              be held at the Benson Hotel, Portland, Oregon on May 18, 19, and 20, 1993.  The
              workshop will cover all aspects of advanced simulation of electronic transport
              in semiconductors and semiconductor devices, particularly those which use large
              computational resources.    The major topics will include:    1)  Advances in
              2-D and 3-D standard simulations (drift- diffusion, hydrodynamic equations)   
              2)  Particle simulation methods (Monte Carlo, molecular  dynamics, cellular
              automaton)    3) Simulation of optical processes, optoelectronic and 
              electro-optic devices (i.e. inclusion of Maxwell's  equations)    4) Quantum
              transport quantum devices    5) High performance computing for computational
              electronics  (parallelization, vectorization, improved numerical  algorithms)  
               The workshop is intended to be an international forum for the discussion on
              the current trends and the future directions of computational electronics.  The
              emphasis of the contributions will be on interdisciplinary aspects of
              Computational Electronics, encompassing Applied Physics, Engineering and
              Applied Mathematics.  Active participation of graduate students, including
              student poster papers, is strongly encouraged.  The Workshop is scheduled a few
              days before the 1994 Microwave Theory and Techniques (MTT) Symposium, to
              facilitate attendance of international speakers to both events.  ***
