Abstract    :
              9403215  Rhines    The water in the deep Caribbean is supplied by a pair of
              overflow  plumes which carry Upper North Atlantic Deep Water through Grappler 
              Pass and nearby Jungfern Pass at about 1800 m depth.  This project  is to
              investigate the entrainment/detrainment of the Atlantic water  plume into the
              Caribbean basin.  The main components of the  proposed study are:  additional
              analysis of detailed sections and  year long current meter records obtained
              during the Carib Vent; the  application of existing models to study the
              Caribbean inflow and  the detachment of overflow water into the interior.  ***
