Abstract    :
              9403361  Higgins  Dr. Daniel A. Higgins has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral 
              Research Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Higgins received his  doctoral degree
              from the University of Wisconsin/Madison under  the supervision of Professor
              Robert Corn. Dr. Higgins will  continue research at the University of Minnesota
              under the  sponsorship of Professor Paul Barbara. His postdoctoral  research
              will couple the use of time-resolved spectroscopic  methods with near-field
              scanning optical microscopy to  investigate the effects of different
              microscopic domains  present on semiconductor electrode surfaces.  Longer term,
              he  will apply near-field scanning optical microscopy to the  in-situ study of
              the photo-electrochemical reactivity of  microscopic crystalline domains on the
              surface of n-doped  polycrystalline titanium dioxide.    The Postdoctoral
              Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is  viewed as an important
              infrastructural program designed to  broaden the knowledge and experience of
              new Ph.D.s and attract  them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical
              research  and teaching.  ***
