Abstract    :
              9403308  Johnson     This research will ascertain what factors regulate
              mycorrhizal  effectivity in relation to mutualistic or parasitic relationships 
              with their host plants.  To be tested is the hypothesis that  enrichment of a
              limiting soil resource causes mycorrhizal plants to  allocate less carbon to
              root exudates, giving a selective advantage  to parasitic forms of vesicular -
              arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM)  fungi.  Fieldwork will be conducted on 24
              fertilized, irrigated,  and control plots at two NSF Long Term Ecological
              Research (LTER)  sites (Minnesota's Cedar Creek Natural History Area and
              Sevilleta  in New Mexico).  %%%  VAM fungi, relatively better studied in
              agricultural systems, are  poorly known in natural ecological communities and
              ecosystems  despite their ubiquitousness in soils.  Nevertheless even in 
              managed agricultural settings, these fungi are still largely  regarded as
              "black boxes" in comparison to our knowledge of other  components of
              agroecosystems.  A more thorough understanding of VAM  biology and ecology is
              likely to lead to improved practices by  ranchers and farmers with regard to
              successful mycorrhizal  inoculation programs, while a more comprehensive
              appreciation of  natural mycorrhizal biodiversity will undoubtedly lead to as
              yet  unforeseen improvements in managed agricultural and forest systems.  ***
