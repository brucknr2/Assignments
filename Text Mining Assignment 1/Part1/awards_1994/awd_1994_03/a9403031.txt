Abstract    :
              9403031  Archdeacon       The Sixth Vermont Summer Workshops on Combinatorics
              and  graph theory will be held at the University of Vermont this  summer.  Its
              purpose is to provide a productive setting for the   interchange of ideas, to
              support collaborative research, and to   help in the dissemination of new
              results and techniques.       Combinatorics and Graph Theory involve the
              systematic study  of the simplest mathematical objects.  At its heart,  
              Combinatorics involves counting,  but counting objects that are  too numerous
              or complicated to list. Graphs are simple diagrams  where points are connected
              by lines.  It is the very simplicity  of the basic ideas of Combinatorics and
              Graph Theory that make  them so important to all sorts of scientists from
              chemists to  electrical engineers.
