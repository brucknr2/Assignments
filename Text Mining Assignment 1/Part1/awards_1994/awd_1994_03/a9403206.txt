Abstract    :
              9403206  Emslie       The project will develop a chronology of avian extinctions
              for  the Plio-Pleistocene of Florida using the exceptional fossil record  of
              birds from this region.  Dozens of published and unpublished  late Pliocene to
              late Pleistocene (Blancan through Rancholabrean  Land Mammal Ages, 2.4-0.010
              Ma) localities that include over 100  taxa of birds provide an excellent
              database from which to establish  this chronology.  These avifaunas are located
              throughout Florida,  represent a diversity of depositional environments and
              provide  substantial information on the structure of terrestrial, wetland  and
              coastal/marine communities throughout this period.       This chronology will
              be supplemented with identification and  description of seven additional
              avifaunas that will add at least 10  undescribed extinct taxa to the fossil
              record of Florida.  Limited  fieldwork at selected sites and newly discovered
              localities will be  completed to determine their age, recover additional fossil
               material and collect paleoenvironmental data using paleomagnetic,  strontium
              isotope, radiocarbon and palynologic sampling.       Avian extinction in the
              Plio-Pleistocene will be investigated  using FAUNMAP, a GIS-based computer
              program,, and digitized land  cover maps of Florida, to reconstruct avian
              distributions and  habitats for specific time intervals.  Paleoenvironmental 
              information will be drawn from geological, paleontological and  palynological
              data from over 50 vertebrate localities.  The maps  generated from this program
              will be compared with the avian  chronology to develop and test hypotheses on
              avian extinctions and  climatic change.       This research will be completed
              over a two year period in  collaboration with a geologist and paynologist.  It
              will provide a  thorough documentation of Plio-Pleistocene avian diversity and 
              extinction in one geographic region of North America and will be  the first
              application of the FAUNMAP system with fossil birds.   Results of this
              investigation will be  applicable to current global  warming and its potential
              impact on vertebrate communities.
