Abstract    :
              This award provides funding for developing automatic construction  of accurate
              models for physical systems.  Specific information  about the target system
              will be provided through measurements made  directly on a physical device, or a
              user's observations described  to the program in varying degrees of precision,
              and hypotheses  suggested by a user.  In addition to construction of such
              models,  a secondary objective is to understand what matters in a model,  what
              qualitative and quantitative are affected by the requirements  of the situation
              and knowledge of the user.  Such understanding is  of practical importance in
              science and engineering in validating  existing models and designs.
