Abstract    :
              9403636  Ulrickson        Many times weather of interest to the public are
              controlled by  factors that are very local in nature.  The researchers will
              study  the climatology and dynamics of a low-level easterly flow in the 
              Spokane, Washington vicinity that occurs beneath a regional  westerly flow at
              least a few days each month and in all seasons of  the year.  Synoptic-scale
              analyses of weather observations indicate  that the environmental flow should
              be westerly at all levels;  therefore, the factors controlling this reverse
              flow  must exist  locally, or on the mesoscale.       These winds are of more
              than academic interest.  The  significance lies in several effects: (1) the
              easterlies modify  temperatures and dew points; (2) when mountain fogs form,
              the  easterlies transport them into the Spokane area; (3) the area's  frequent
              surfaced-based inversions, which strongly influence  regional air quality and
              controls, are modified; (4) because of  their diurnal occurrence, the
              easterlies affect air traffic  control; (5) these winds influence the transport
              of suspended  particles and airborne chemicals.       The Principal
              Investigators will attack this problem using  climatological and diagnostic
              studies as well as a mesoscale  numerical model.  They also will collaborate
              with forecasters at  the local National Weather Service Office with the intent
              of  formulating methods for improved prediction of these episodes.  ***
