Abstract    :
              9403159  Auerbach         Dr. Scott M. Auerbach has been awarded a Postdoctoral
              Research   Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Auerbach's doctoral degree was   from
              the University of California at Berkeley under the   supervision of Professor
              William Miller. Dr. Auerbach will   continue research at the University of
              California at Santa   Barbara under the sponsorship of Professor Horia Metiu.
              Dr.   Auerbach's postdoctoral training will focus on the formation   and
              characterization of compound semiconductor clusters in   zeolites. Dynamics of
              cluster formation will also be modelled   computationally. Longer term, Dr
              Auerbach will study the   physical chemistry of technologically significant
              materials,   specializing in catalysis and transport in microporous   inorganic
              environments. Research in this area has broad   implications in petroleum
              refining, chemicals production, and   pollution control.    The Postdoctoral
              Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is   viewed as an important
              infrastructural program designed to   broaden the knowledge and experience of
              new Ph.D.s and attract   them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical
              research   and teaching.  ***
