Abstract    :
              This U.S.-Brazil award will support a collaborative research project between
              Dr.William Fenical of Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of
              California and Dra. Rosangela de A. Epifanio of Universidade Federal
              Fluminense, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil to explore the natural products chemistry
              and chemical ecology of selected Brazilian marine invertebrates, principally
              gorgonian corals and encrusting ascidians.  Their program is composed of
              interactive studies to expand knowledge of the sources, types and reactivities
              of defensive molecules produced by Brazilian invertebrates, and to explore the
              natural functions of these molecules in defensive adaptations.  The objective
              of the project is to form a collaboration between the two researchers through a
              series of expeditions and research seminars within Brazil, as well as research
              visits by the Brazilian researchers to Scripps. Some of the visits will
              emphasize the training of students in new instrumental methods, i.e. 2D NMR
              techniques, and biological methodologies associated with determining the
              functions of secondary metabolites in  shallow marine habitats.
