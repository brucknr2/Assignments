Abstract    :
              9403380  Manoranjan       This project will support the Workshop on Mathematical
               Biology to be held March 18-20, 1994 at Washington State  University.  The
              workshop will bring together theoretical and  experimental scientists working
              in areas of biology, mathematics,  and physics, thus creating an atmosphere for
              open communication  and in-depth interactions.  The major speakers will address
               topics in population models in ecology, bursting in neurons,  chemical
              oscillations, and thermoregulation and flight.       The workshop will be
              interdisciplinary and is expected to be  a focal point for the meeting of
              theoretical and experimental  scientists, especially from the Pacific Northwest
              region.  There  will be an emphasis on attracting recent doctoral recipients
              and  graduate students to attend the workshop and in providing them 
              opportunities for open communication with senior scientists on  topics at the
              cutting edge of theoretical and mathematical  biology.  ***
