Abstract    :
              9403597  Kodama         Integrable Systems in Physics and Engineering     The
              main  themes on the project are A) Soliton Communication Systems, B).  Normal
              Form and Symmetry, and C). KP Hierarchy and Related Topics  in Physics and
              Mathematics. In project A, the main purpose is to  analyze and control soliton
              solutions in nearly integrable  systems, and the goal is to design and
              determine a most feasible  model for a long-distance and high-bit-rate
              communication system  using soliton. In project B, the goal is to reformulate
              the  normal form theory of Poincare-Dulac-Birkhoff for nearly  integrable
              system in terms of symmetries of the leading order  integrable system. In
              project C, the emphasis is to apply  solution methods developed in the KP and
              dispersionless KP  theories to the field of conformal field theory. These
              projects  contain several new directions of the theory of integrable  systems. 
              Recent progress on the theory of integrable systems  seems to be demonstrated
              by finding its applications in several  different fields of research, such as
              high energy physics,  classical and quantum field theories, nonlinear optics,
              and  representation theory of infinite dimensional Lie algebra. This  expanding
              area of applications provides a wide variety of studies  in applied
              mathematics, and promotes a progress on  interdisciplinary fields which are the
              most inportant aspects of  modern science. The proposed research directly
              relates with these  area of reseach, and I believe that the projects will make 
              several contributions to education in the field of applied  mathematics and to
              development of human resources in science and  engineering.
