Abstract    :
                   Using the technique of the Ricci flow evolution equation,  the investigator
              will study the structure of certain classes of  complete non-compact Kaehler
              manifolds with positive bisectional  curvature, the smooth structure of compact
              Riemannian manifolds  with positive curvature operator and the existence of
              Kaehler-  Einstein metrics on certain compact Kaehler manifolds.       The
              research covers several topics in modern differential  geometry. The geometry
              of evolution equations is realized in many  fields of mathematical physics,
              areas relating to global change,  population studies and the biological
              sciences. It is expected  that the investigator will be active in the training
              of graduate  students.
