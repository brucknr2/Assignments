Abstract    :
              Using oxygen isotope analysis, the hypothesis that the variation of freshwater
              flux   in the Labarador Sea is responsible for much of the variations in water
              properties   along the northeast U.S. continental margin will be tested. In
              particular the effects   of variations of this flux on the shelf-slope water
              exchange and the freshwater   volume along the Middle Atllantic Bight and the
              circulation and mixing in the Gulf of   maine will be investigated.
