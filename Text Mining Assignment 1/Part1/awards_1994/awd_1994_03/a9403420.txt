Abstract    :
              9403420  O'Sullivan  "Construction of a Decoder for an Algebraic Geometry Code" 
              This project is funded under the National Science Foundation's  (NSF) Small
              Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, which is  designed to provide an
              opportunity for small business, particularly  the small high technology firm,
              to participate in NSF research.   Phase I of the SBIR program serves as a
              filter to select promising  proposals and determine if the firm can do high
              quality research.   Phase II is the principal research project.  Phase III is
              the  conversion of the NSF-funded research into commercial applications  and
              technological innovation supported by follow-on private venture  capital or
              other non-federal financing.  The objective of this  Phase II program is to
              continue the development of a decoder for  Hermitian codes, begun in Phase I,
              by completing additional  refinements to the mathematics of the decoding
              algorithm and to the  C-language decoder simulation, and by designing the
              architecture  and detailed logic of a demonstration VSLI codec implementation
              for  a specific four bit code.  ***
