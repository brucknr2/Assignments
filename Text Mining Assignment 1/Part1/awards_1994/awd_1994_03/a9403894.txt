Abstract    :
              9403894  Tanner    Technical abstract:  The optical properties-in both normal
              and  superconducting states-of high temperature superconductors will be 
              studied at far infrared-ultraviolet frequencies.  In the normal  state, the
              research will focus on the nature of the non-Drude mid  infrared absorption, on
              the lifetime and interaction of the charge  carriers, and on the anisotropy of
              the quasi-two-dimensional copper  oxide layers.  In the superconducting state,
              the research will  focus on issues of the superconducting energy gap, on
              possible  anisotropy of the gap, and on the lifetime of quasiparticle 
              excitations.    Non-technical abstract:  Detailed investigation of the optical 
              properties of the high temperature superconductors is essential for  a complete
              understanding of these very novel materials.  By varying  the wavelength of the
              light from the long-wavelength infrared to  the ultraviolet, information about
              the motion of the charge  carriers-in both the normal and the superconducting
              state of theses  materials- will be learned.  This information may contribute
              to  understanding the superconductivity in these materials and will  help to
              characterize their usefulness for potential applications  such as in microwave
              circuits and infrared sensors.  ***
