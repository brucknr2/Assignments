Abstract    :
              DMS-9403615  Kuperberg, W.     The proposed research is in the area of Discrete
              Geometry and involves the packing and covering of space with congruent replicas
              of a convex body.  The PI will extend his work in two dimensions to dimension 3
              and higher.  Some of the PI's earlier work has been applied in Computational
              Geometry for creating geometric algorithms and estimating their computational
              complexity; the proposed work should be equally applicable.   ??
