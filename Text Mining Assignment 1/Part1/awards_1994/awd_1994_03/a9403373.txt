              Title: Variability of Tropical Circulation and Climate    The PI will continue
              research on the variability of tropical  circulation and climate on various
              time scales: (i) The annual  cycle of the lower-tropospheric circulation over
              Subsaharan Africa  and of the flow and convection patterns over tropical South 
              America; shall be re-analyzed, (ii) The mechanisms of interannual  variability
              will be examined; (iii) Decadal-scale evolutions as  part of global change will
              be assessed for the Indian Ocean domain  and eastern Africa, where they may
              help understand abrupt  environmental changes in the latter part of the last
              century, and  for the three near equatorial convection centers that play a 
              pivotal role in the global circulation; (iv) Climate prediction  work shall
              include method development for rainfall anomalies in  equatorial East Africa
              and northeast Brazil, which continues to be  a "target of opportunity" for
              experimentations with novel  techniques.  The various projects components are
              interrelated.      This research is important because it strives to add to our 
              understanding of climate processes.
