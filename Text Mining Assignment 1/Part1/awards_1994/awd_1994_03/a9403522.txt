Abstract    :
              9403522  Zimmermann  This is a research effort in the area of low temperature
              condensed  matter physics.  The project will investigate critical velocities 
              and phase-slip in the flow of superfluid helium-4 through submicron  and
              micron-size apertures in thin, free-standing films of submicron  thickness. 
              The aim of the work is to understand fundamental  quantum vortex processes
              involved in the first onset of dissipation  in superfluid flow as the velocity
              is increased from zero.  Use is  made of a high-Q superfluid resonator to
              excite oscillatory flow of  the superfluid through the aperture and to sense
              the onset of  dissipation.  %%%  This is a research effort in the area of low
              temperature physics.   The project involves the study of superfluid helium,
              which does not  transport heat energy as ordinary fluids.  The heat energy in
              such  systems requires generation of vortices, analogous to smoke rings,  that
              can by generated as the superfluid moves through microscopic  apertures.  The
              research will study fundamental aspects of vortex  generation and energy
              dissipation in superfluid helium-4.  The work  is of fundamental significance
              but may as well have technical  importance in the general field of fluid
              hydrodynamics.  The  project includes computer modeling of the fluid
              hydrodynamics under  experimental observation.
