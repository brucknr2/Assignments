Abstract    :
              9403252  Ackerly     Other functional and comparative studies have dealt with
              intra-  and interspecific variation of various plant characters, but use of 
              phylogeny reconstruction to investigate evolution and coadaptation  among
              aspects of canopy design is novel.  Four components comprise  this project: a)
              using material from living collections (botanical  gardens), a DNA - based
              phylogeny will be generated for 30 to 40  North American and Asian species of
              maple (Acer, of which there are  more than a hundred species altogether), b) a
              broad survey of  interspecific variation in canopy architecture will be
              conducted,  c) intraspecific variation in populations of six eastern North 
              American species are to be studied, and d) methods of phylogenetic  comparative
              analysis will be applied to test for correlated  evolutionary change among
              suites of leaf and canopy architectural  traits.  %%%  The adaptive
              significance of tree canopy architecture is a long -  standing problem in plant
              ecology.  Adoption of a systematics  methodology to the question is innovative,
              unique, and one that  certainly holds significant promise for environmental
              biology.  The  incorporation of a molecular evolution aspect in the work also 
              bolsters it.  In addition to benefits to fundamental scientific  knowledge,
              potential spin - offs would include the possibility that  plant architecture
              attributes could be genetically altered in the  future, for horticultural /
              ornamental or other purposes.  ***
