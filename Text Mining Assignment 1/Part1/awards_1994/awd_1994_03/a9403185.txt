Abstract    :
              9403185 Moodie          This research is concerned with facilitating research
              collaboration between American and European investigators involved with funded
              investigations of manufacturing systems.  Prior attempts at collaboration have
              had marginal success.  Within the program researched here, a small group of
              currently funded researchers from the United States and E.C., with narrowly
              defined, on going research programs, will participate in two focused workshops:
               one in Europe, the other in United States.          Immediate sharing of
              usable research results is anticipated and future, joint research projects can
              be established.  This program will provide a format for stimulating research
              collaboration in other areas of manufacturing research.
