Abstract    :
              9403533  Vitter       The proposal coverss group activity in the general area of
               mathematical physics, topology and complex geometry. Specifics  include
              foliations of Monge-Ampere type, group actions on spheres   and the geometry of
              vector bundles over Grassmannians. These  topics are important in modern
              mathematical physics including  soliton theory.   ***
