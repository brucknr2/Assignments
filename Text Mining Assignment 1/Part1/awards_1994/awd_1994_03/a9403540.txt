Abstract    :
              9403540  Curry       The Program in Applied Mathematics at the University of 
              Colorado will purchase computational equipment which will be  dedicated to the
              support of research in the mathematical  sciences.  The equipment will be used
              for several research  projects, including in particular:  1.)  Numerically
              Induced  Chaos, Sympletic Integrators and Nonlinear Wave Equations;  2.)  Fast
              Numerical Algorithms:  Wavelets; 3.)  Dynamical  Systems:  Computational
              Experiments with Maps; 4.)  Multilevel Methods for First Order System Least
              Squares  Discretization of Partial Differential Equations; and 5.)  Nonlinear
              Ocean Waves:  Simulation, Chaos, and Field Data
