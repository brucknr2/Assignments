Abstract    :
                   The investigator and his colleague analyze, develop, and  implement
              computational methods for perturbed generalized  eigenvalue problems.  The
              project has three main parts:  a) Study the mathematical foundation of solution
              schemes for the     calculation of a few (extreme) eigenvalues and associated  
                eigenvectors of generalized systems;  b) Develop practical computer solution
              procedures for the     generalized and modified eigenvalue problem; and  c)
              Devise efficient implementation in MIMD distributed memory     computer
              environments.         These problems arise in the dynamic analysis of
              structures.  A frequently encountered problem is how to take into account in 
              analysis and design changes introduced after the structural  dynamics analysis
              has been completed, and the natural frequencies  and modes have been computed. 
              The investigators develop robust,  accurate and fast algorithms for solving a
              variety of such  problems.
