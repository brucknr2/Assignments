Abstract    :
              9403850  Smillie       The research entails the study of the dynamics of the
              family  of polynomial diffeomorphisms of complex euclidean space of 2- 
              dimensions which is to parallel the 1-dimensional case. The  techniques are
              drawn from the areas of smooth ergodic theory,  pluripotential theory and the
              theory of currents. New insights  into the dynamics of real and complex
              diffeomorphisms are  expected. The research is related to current research in
              fractals  and chaos.  ***
