Abstract    :
              9403416  Kouri  Univ. of Houston  This project in the theory of reactive
              molecular dynamics is supported by the NSF Theoretical and Computational
              Chemistry Program.  The time-independent wavepacket (TIW) approach to quantum
              mechanics will be developed  and implemented into reactive scattering codes
              using polynominal representations of the full Green's operators with absorbing
              potentials and the spectral density operator.  Both scattering and bound-state
              Fermion systems will be treated.   The possibility of deriving a TIW Kohn-type
              S-matrix  variational principle will be explored.  The TIW method will be
              implemented using distributed approximations functions to represent a function
              evaluated on a discrete grid of points.    The TIW method, recently invented
              jointly by Donald Kouri and David Hoffman, offers an alternative to traditional
              methods of solving the time-independent Schroedinger equation for scattering
              states in the continuum (the S-matrix formalism) or solving the time-dependent
              Schroedinger equation for wavepackets that evolve in time.  The new TIW method
              has computational advantages over each of these.  Kohn has previously derived a
              variational principle for traditional S-matrix calculations.  One of the major
              goals of this research project is the development of an analogous variational
              principle for TIW calculations.  The hope and expectation is that this research
              in formal theory and computational methodology will significantly improve our
              ability to make accurate and detailed predictions of molecular processes  in
              the gas phase.  Possible future applications of this technology include
              computer models of ozone depletion in the earth's atmosphere or high
              temperature combustion processes in jet engines and waste incinerators.
