Abstract    :
              9403114  Deem  Dr. Michael W. Deem has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral 
              Research Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Deem received his  doctoral degree at the
              University of California at Berkeley  under the supervision of Professor David
              Chandler. Dr. Deem  will continue his research at Harvard University under the 
              sponsorship of Professor David Nelson. His postdoctoral  research will focus on
              the dynamic properties of polymerized  two-dimensional membranes. Longer term,
              he plans to study the  statistical mechanics of entangled polymers such as
              rubber or  carbon nanotubes.    The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in
              Chemistry Program is  viewed as an important infrastructural program designed
              to  broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract  them into
              meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research  and teaching.
