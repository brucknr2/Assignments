Abstract    :
              9403925  Zhdanov      The PIs will develop algorithms for better imaging,
              delineation and  characterization of underground structures by using
              electromagnetic  geophysical data.  The EM migration algorithm is a stable
              procedure  that accurately restores the phase of the upgoing field inside the 
              Earth.  It is also computationally efficient compared to previous  techniques. 
              The PIs will expand the utility of their present 2D  migration method and
              extend their method to 3D for borehole as well  as surface EM data.  ****
