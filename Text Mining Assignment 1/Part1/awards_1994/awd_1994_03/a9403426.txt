Abstract    :
              9403426  Lessard          This project will investigate the bioenergetics,
              growth and prey  preferences of representative heterotrophic dinoflagellates
              and  ciliates in batch cultures to define the trophic roles of each  group and
              to determine how these two groups of potential  competitors coexist in the
              marine plankton.  A systematic  investigation will be done on the bioenergetics
              and food  preferences in a large number of representative heterotrophic 
              dinoflagellates and ciliates using a 14C-radiotracing method which  will
              include direct measures of egestion and excretion of organic  matter. 
              Information on gross growth efficiencies, maximal growth  rates, and the
              effects of temperature and food quality will be  obtained under strictly
              comparable conditions.  Careful evaluation  of the carbon:  volume relationship
              of thecate and athecate  dinoflagellates will also be undertaken, as this is an
              important  but uncertain parameter, which greatly affects estimates of gross 
              growth efficiencies and biomass estimations.
