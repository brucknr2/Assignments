Abstract    :
              9403360  Gilkey       The research covers a number of topics in the overlapping 
              areas of geometry, analysis and topology. These mainly involve  questions of
              spectral geometry and invariants, in particular the  eta-invariant and
              asymptotics related to heat equation techniques  for manifolds with boundary.
              The research has potential  applications to other areas of mathematics,
              particularly  topology, as well as to operator theory in mathematical physics.
