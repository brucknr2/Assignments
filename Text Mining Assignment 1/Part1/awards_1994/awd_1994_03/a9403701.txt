Abstract    :
              9403701  Laskowski       Dr. Michael Laskowski will continue his research in the
               field of model theory, a branch of mathematical logic.  He  expects to obtain
              more information as to the possible mechanisms  making a type inevitable in the
              setting of superstable theories  that do not have the Dimensional Order
              Property (DOP).  Laskowski  expects to complete his classification of those
              countable  theories for which there are two non-isomorphic models that can  be
              forced isomorphic by a forcing with the countable chain  condition.  Finally,
              he will continue his research into an  inherent asymmetry between two new
              methods of constructing models  of small, superstable theories.       Most of
              the field of model theory (as a branch of  mathematical logic) is concerned
              with developing methods for  building algebraic structures with certain
              properties.  The  problem of whether there is a structure having an element 
              satisfying an infinite set of properties (i.e., realizing a type)  is well
              understood: such a structure exists if and only if, for  every finite subset of
              the type, there is an element satisfying  each of these properties.   However,
              it is a much more subtle  question to ask whether a given type is inevitable,
              i.e., whether  EVERY structure contains an element realizing the type.  Without
               adding additional restrictions to the class of structures under 
              consideration, it is known that there can be no satisfactory  criterion for
              which types are inevitable.  Laskowski will  continue his research on what
              additional constraints must be  placed on the algebraic structure to yield a
              natural  characterization of inevitability.  ***
