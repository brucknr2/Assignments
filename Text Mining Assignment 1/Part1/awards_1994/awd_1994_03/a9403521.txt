Abstract    :
              9403521  Tossell  Although gold adsorption onto sulfide mineral surfaces has 
              been extensively studied experimentally, the microscopic  mechanism is still
              poorly known.  We propose to calculate  the structures, energetics and spectral
              properties of gold  bisulfide and gold complexes bonded to metal sulfide
              species  in solution, such as the arsenic and antimony sulfides, and  to the
              surfaces of sulfide minerals, particularly the  arsenic and antimony sulfides. 
              Our goal is to understand  why such gold complexes are preferentially absorbed
              onto  these sulfide mineral surfaces and to determine the  microscopic
              structures of the surface species formed.  In  the process of achieving this
              goal we expect to shed light  on a number of other questions of general
              geochemical  interest, e.g. the speciation of As and Sb in sulfidic  waters,
              the scanning tunneling spectra of sulfide surfaces,  the structure and
              properties of the surface functional  groups, and the nature of the adsorption
              complexes formed  between collector molecules and sulfide mineral surfaces.
