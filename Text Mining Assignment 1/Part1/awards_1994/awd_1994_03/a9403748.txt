Abstract    :
                                                   ABSTRACT    Proposal:  CHE-9403748  PI: 
              Myers, A. G.                   Institution:  Cal Tech    This award from the
              Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will help the Department of 
              Chemistry at California Institute of Technology acquire upgrades for existing
              400 and 500 MHz  NMR spectrometers which will be used in research
              investigations in the following areas of  chemistry:  (1) Synthetic, Structural
              and Mechanistic Studies in Organotransition Metal  Chemistry; (2) Studies on
              the origin of the hyperthermostability of rubredoxin from  Pyrococcus furiosus;
              (3) Specificity in Co- and Post-translational Modification Reactions;  (4)
              Organometallic and Catalyst Synthesis; (5) Synthetic and Mechanistic Studies in
              Organic  Chemistry; and (6) Sequence Specific Recognition and Cleavage of DNA. 
                Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
              available to the  chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. 
              It is used to identify unknown  substances, characterize specific arrangements
              of atoms within molecules, and to study the  dynamics of interactions between
              molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR  spectroscopy is
              essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.  The results from
               these NMR studies are useful in areas such as polymers and catalysis, and in
              biology.
