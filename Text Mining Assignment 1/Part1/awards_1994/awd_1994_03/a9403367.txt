Abstract    :
              9403367    O'Brien        This award is under the International Junior
              Investigator  and Postdoctoral Fellows Program, which enables U.S.  scientists
              and engineers to conduct three to twelve months  of research abroad at research
              centers of proven excellence.  The program's awards provide opportunities for
              joint  research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities,  expertise
              and experimental conditions abroad.        This award will support a
              seven-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Timothy E. O'Brien of
              Washington State  University to work with  Professor Dr. Friedrich Pukelsheim 
              at the Institut fur Mathematik der Universitat Augsburg on  optimal design for
              nonlinear regression models.    This research will focus on several specific
              problems.  First, development of a theoretical framework will help  researchers
              select among design procedures available for  nonlinear models.  Second,
              extension of  existing second-  order and Bayesian design procedures to
              accommodate the  multi-response and/or compartmental  nonlinear models that 
              face many researchers.  Third, elevation of  compound design  procedures for
              nonlinear models so that researchers can  obtain optimal designs even when they
              are unsure which model  they should use. In addition to enhancing the
              theoretical  understanding of statistics, the results of this work will 
              furnish scientists in other fields with efficient tools to  accomplish their
              research. ***
