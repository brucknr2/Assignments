Abstract    :
              Scott         The investigator develops an approach to scientific  computation
              that incorporates research in numerical analysis,  aspects of computer science,
              and solution of model problems in  mechanics.  Three research areas are the
              focus of the project:  computational problems in incompressible fluid dynamics
              (including  free--boundary problems and high-order, mixed method 
              discretizations in two and three dimensions), diffusion  acceleration
              techniques for particle transport, and algorithms for  parallel computers. 
              This research includes an analysis of each  algorithm, yielding a rigorous
              justification that it accurately  approximates the phenomenon under study. 
              Finally, the research  involves prototype implementations of the algorithms in
              computer  programs via techniques that can assure a robust and easily 
              maintained code.  In collaboration with specialists in related  disciplines,
              these  computer programs are used to study basic  physical phenomena in a
              variety of areas.       The overall objective of the project is to improve the 
              foundations for software for solving problems in science and  technology that
              involve large scale, multidimensional models in  continuum mechanics.  These
              models are the basis for computer  simulation used in engineering design in
              manufacturing processes,  in environmental modeling and the development of
              remediation  techniques, and in various aspects of biotechnology.  The research
               involves the development of new algorithms for several problems  too difficult
              to solve by existing techniques.  It emphasizes the  efficient use of
              high-performance computers in realistic  simulations.
