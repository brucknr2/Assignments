Abstract    :
              9403897  McGehee       The support is for the Midwest Dynamical Conferences. The
               meetings involve presentations and workshops conducted by  principal speakers
              on the the frontier level of research in many  aspects of dynamical systems and
              its applications. This series  has a strong educational aspect for graduate
              students and  provides a suitable forum of interaction for recent PhD's in 
              advancing their research potential.  ***
