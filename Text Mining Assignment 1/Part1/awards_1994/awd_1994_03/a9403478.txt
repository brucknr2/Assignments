Abstract    :
              9403478  Leaman    University of Miami will continue development of a new
              generation  of fast acoustic current profilers using a set of surface-mounted 
              Global Positioning System (GPS) transponders for navigation.  GPS  receivers
              are to be mounted on a ocean profiler, PEGASUS, that  makes a series of
              excursions from the surface to a predetermined  depth at back to the surface. 
              Its lateral displacement is a  function of undersea currents.  Using
              differential GPS techniques  to track the movement of PEGASUS provides greater
              accuracy and  reliability than traditional tracking methods.  This new effort 
              will carry the prototype design from a crude testing phase to an  operational
              status.
