Abstract    :
              9403742  Meyn         This proposal concerns development and application of new 
              methodologies for analysis of complex systems, most of which can  be seen as
              special cases of general multiclass network systems  with feedback.  Perhaps
              the most important examples is the design  of semiconductor manufacturing
              systems, where one impact of the  analysis would include the construction of
              stable and efficient  routing and scheduling policies; but the applications of 
              understanding the general systems is far more widespread.       Specifically we
              propose to carry out research into three  aspects of system analysis:    (i)   
                 Methods of evaluating system stability and instability,            which
              will include not only discrete and continuous            time representations
              of systems, but also fluid and            diffusion approximations for such
              systems;    (ii)      Performance measures on stable systems, and           
              specifically comparison of rates at which such systems            achieve a
              stable regime;    (iii)     Robustness of system design against perturbations  
                       in assumptions.         The specific types of applications envisaged
              include  manufacturing systems, and more general queuing systems with 
              feedback, for which the stability and performance results to be  developed are
              well suited.  We will also consider in detail  scheduling algorithms for such
              systems, and develop simulation  methods for modeling and performance
              validation.       Overall this project can be expected to deliver new 
              methodologies which will unify the current work in all of (i)-  (iii); and to
              provide a number of significant applications to  manufacturing and engineering
              systems which, of themselves, will  be a major importance in improving design
              guidelines.    ***
