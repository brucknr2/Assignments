Abstract    :
              9403587  Dorman       This experiment is designed to provide direct 
              observational constraints on the distribution of melt and  the pattern of
              upwelling beneath a mid-ocean ridge.  Studies  of electromagnetic and seismic
              wave propagation in the  mantle with arrays of oceanbottom instruments will
              furnish  measurements that can be inverted to find horizontal and  vertical
              variations in velocity and conductivity structure  that can be used to test
              theoretical models of flow.       An array of 47 ocean-bottom seismometers will
              be  deployed for six months on the East Pacific Rise at about 17  degrees south
              to record teleseismic and regional earthquake  sources.  P and S waves, as well
              as other bady wave phases  and Love and Rayleigh surface waves recorded by the
              array  will be used to probe lateral variations in mantle structure  to a depth
              of 100 to 200 km and out to several hundred km  from the ridge axis.  The main
              goal is to establish whether  there is a narrow region of high melt
              concentration and low  seismic velocities directly beneath the ridge axis and
              to  map its vertical and horizontal extent.  Another goal is to  constrain the
              pattern of upwelling.    ***
