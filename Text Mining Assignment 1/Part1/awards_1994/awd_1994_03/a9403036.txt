Abstract    :
              Gardner  ATM-9403036    This project continues development and operation of
              several lidar  systems that are being used to explore the composition and 
              structure of the middle atmosphere and includes the analysis of  data collected
              with these instruments during past experimental  campaigns.  In the
              ALOHA/ANLC-93 campaigns, measurements were made  from the NCAR Elektra aircraft
              in coordination with an extensive  array of ground-based instruments.  Data
              from these campaigns will  be analyzed and a workshop will be conducted to
              discuss the  results.  The project includes new campaigns using the Na 
              Doppler/Temperature lidars at Urbana and at the Air Force Starfire  Optical
              Range in New Mexico to test the capabilities of the 3.5 m  telescope at that
              facility.  These observations will be used to  address several fundamental
              questions related to gravity wave  generation, propagation, and dissipation in
              the atmosphere.
