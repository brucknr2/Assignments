Abstract    :
                     9403698  Jones   This project involves the dissertation research of a
              student in  cultural anthropology from City University of New York.  The 
              student, a Puerto Rican native, will study how local "cultural  centers" in
              Puerto Rico define what it means to be Puerto Rican  in light of contesting
              claims for support and influence by  diverse groups.  Using participant
              observation, in-depth  interviews and a survey of a sample of Centers, the
              student will  study how "cultural nationalism" is influenced by these public 
              institutions.       This project is important because it will help explain how 
              local ethnic communities develop feelings of "cultural  nationalism" in
              contrast to a larger, dominant group.  Understanding how claims for legitimacy
              and resources arise among  ethnic groups is important to help society react to
              such claims  fairly.  In addition, dissertation research projects increase the 
              scientific capacity of the nation, and this particular project  will help train
              a minority scientist and so will add to the base  of minority scientists in the
              U.S.  ***
