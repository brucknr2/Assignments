Abstract    :
              This project will map and characterize seafloor debris and  associated benthic
              habitats and to contour the seafloor in the  vicinity of McMurdo. Large numbers
              of barrels with unknown contents  and other debris have been dumped or
              accumulated in the near-shore  marine environment in McMurdo. This project will
              be the first  critical step in determining the extent and risk to the
              environment  of the potentially toxic debris. The principal investigators will 
              use high resolution sidescan sonar, bathymetric profiling, scuba  surveys, and
              photographic records to document the distribution and  nature of debris while
              also mapping local physical habitats. The  proposed work will also produce the
              first detailed bathymetric  contour chart of the McMurdo area. Depth contour
              data are key  elements in the development of accurate nearshore currents models
               needed to predict the movement of effluents from the new McMurdo  sewer
              outfall.    These data sets will be incorporated as the foundation elements in 
              a comprehensive benthic Geographic information System to be  maintained on
              existing National Science Foundation and Antarctic  Support Associates computer
              facilities. Elements to be include will  be the base map overlays for sidescan
              sonar images, depth,  navigation tracks, debris, habitat type, community type
              sediment  chemistry and pollutant loads, species lists and photographs.
