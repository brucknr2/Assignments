Abstract    :
               The proposed research is directed towards a number of topics in the area of
              likelihood based statistical methods. One set of topics will involve the
              development of several new asymptotic methods in the area of parametric models,
              focussing on improved distributional properties in the presence of nuisance
              parameters and on testing methods for the number of components in a mixture.
              The second set of topics revolves around semiparametric and nonparametric
              inference in the mixture model, where the class of models needs to be expanded
              and further inferential methods need to be developed.  The most widely used
              method for drawing statistical conclusions, called the method of maximum
              likelihood, is based on a mathematical version of the intuitive notion that the
              true value of a parameter will generally be found among those that seem "most
              likely" given the observed data. This powerful tool enables one to write down
              models for complex phenomenon and, by maximizing the likelihood, draw
              conclusions about the state of nature that generated the data. However, the
              likelihood method is not perfect, and the objective of this research proposal
              is to further its development, both in computation and in theory, in several
              areas of wide application.
