Abstract    :
              9403199  Resasco    This  is a study of the mechanisms of promotion occurring in
              olefin alkylation and methane coupling reactions when transition metals are
              added to sulfated zirconia catalysts.  Promoters such as iron, manganese,
              platinum, and tin that can modify the initially high acidity of these materials
              are studied; acid catalyst site densities and strengths are measured.  A series
              of weak bases is used to characterize acid-site distribution by
              temperature-programmed desorption.  A variable temperature,
              diffuse-reflectance, Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer is used to monitor
              interactions of probe molecules with acid sites.  These results are correlated
              with mass spectra of the evolved products to illuminate reaction mechanisms. 
              The effect of  hydrogen is also observed.    The reactions being studied are
              being introduced to replace refinery operations that are no   longer
              environmentally acceptable.  When these systems are fully developed ( a ways
              off   yet), they will permit natural gas to displace crude oil as the principal
              source of  liquid   fuels and petrochemical (including polymer) feedstocks.
