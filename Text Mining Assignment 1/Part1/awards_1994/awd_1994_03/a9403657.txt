Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              will assist the  Department of Chemistry at Iowa State University in the
              purchase of a quadrupole mass  spectrometer.  The faculty members whose
              research is dependent upon mass spectroscopy will  greatly benefit from the
              acquisition of this instrument.  Research projects to be carried out with  this
              instrument include:  analysis of high and low molecular weight polar compounds,
              along  with liquid sample introduction capability; the development of new
              synthetic methods for  the synthesis of medicinally useful compounds; studies
              of free radical and electron transfer  processes; characterization of
              organometallic complexes; the study of molecular recognition;  and new pathways
              for the total synthesis of natural products.    A high resolution mass
              spectrometer is an instrument used to measure the precise molecular  weight of
              a molecular ion.  This information is an important piece of data used to help
              determine  the atomic composition and, sometimes, the molecular geometry of a
              molecule.  It is one of the  essential tools needed to learn the detailed
              structure of newly synthesized molecules.
