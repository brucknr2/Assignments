Abstract    :
              9403124  Nguyen  Dr. Sonbinh T. Nguyen has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral 
              Research Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Nguyen received his  doctoral degree from
              the California Institute of Technology  under the supervision of Professor
              Robert Grubbs.  Dr. Nguyen  will continue research at the Scripps Research
              Institute under  the sponsorship of Professor Barry Sharpless. His postdoctoral
               research will train him in the fundamentals of transition metal  mediated
              asymmetric catalysis. Specifically he will study the  reaction mechanism of the
              osmium-catalyzed dihydroxylation of  olefins. Longer term, he plans to focus
              his research on the  metal-catalyzed  2+1  cycloaddition of carbenes and
              nitrenes to  double bonds, with particular emphasis on the rhodium-catalyzed 
              aziridination reaction.    The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry
              Program is  viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to  broaden
              the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract  them into meaningful
              careers in contemporary chemical research  and teaching.
