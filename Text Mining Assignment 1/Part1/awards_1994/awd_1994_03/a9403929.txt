Abstract    :
                9403929  Perry  This is an individual Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
              Plant Biology award.  The applicant received her Ph.D. from University of
              Wisconsin.  For her Ph.D. thesis research, she studied chloroplast protein
              import apparatus.  She now plans to expand her scientific experience to the
              area of molecular genetics and developmental biology.  She will carry out her
              postdoctoral fellowship research in the laboratory of Dr. Donna Fernandez at
              University of Wisconsin.  The proposed research is entitled "Role of Emb1p, a
              MADS-box protein, in embryogenesis".
