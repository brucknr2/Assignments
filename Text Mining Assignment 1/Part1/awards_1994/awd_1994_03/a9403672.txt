Abstract    :
              9403672  Siniff  A study of the ecology of Antarctic seals will be conducted in 
              conjunction with a physical oceanography cruise that will take  place in the
              Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas during February and  March 1994.  The
              objectives of the oceanography and design of the  cruise track offers an
              unparalleled opportunity to investigate  the region's seal populations.  A
              recent international workshop  on Antarctic seals has identified these top
              level predators as  potentially important in the carbon flux of the Southern
              Ocean.   This workshop posed questions to address hypotheses regarding the 
              seals' roles in the pack ice ecosystem.  This cruise will help  collect data on
              one of these nine important research questions:   "What are the causes and
              scale of variation in the distribution  of pack ice seals?"  Since the cruise
              is multidisciplinary in  nature, there will be data collected on oceanographic
              parameters,  as well as bird abundance which will make possible analyses to 
              give insight into functional relationships and hence causes of  variations in
              distributional patterns.  The seal studies will  collect data on densities and
              distribution, as well as tissue  samples for genetic comparisons among regions
              of the Antarctic.  ***
