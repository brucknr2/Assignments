Abstract    :
              9403476  Jannson   This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
              project develops a prototype polymer-based optical bus (POB) for the shared
              memory architecture of high speed data acquisition systemq.  Key POB elements
              were fabricated and tested successfully in Phase I.  The optical power budget
              is below 20 dB, which is a low loss for greater than 50 boards.  The electrical
              power budget is around 5 watts.    Based on an innovative optical backplane
              architecture, the POB system, along with a new high speed bus protocol, is
              automatically adaptable for high speed, high volume memory data acquisition
              systems and to standard electrical bus architectures.  Advantages of POB are:
              maximum data rates great than 100 gigabits per second; a large number of
              boards; and one-order-of-magnitude larger inherent backplane propagation
              speeds.       The POB shared memory architecture has potential for a new
              generation of distributed computing systems for application in a wide range of
              physical measurements as well as in PCs and work stations.  It can also be
              applied in optical analog to electrical data buses but at much higher speeds
              than presently possible.
