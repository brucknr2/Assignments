Abstract    :
              9403399  Conlon        The principal investigator will conduct research on
              problems in partial  differential equations. These problems are motivated by
              intuitions concerning  the behavior of interacting random walks over large time
              scales. A major step  in this direction would be to understand random walks in
              random environments.  The principal investigator's approach to these problems
              has been to obtain  sufficiently sharp estimates on solutions to appropriate
              partial differential  equations. He intends to continue this work.        The
              general goal of this project is to advance understanding of  diffusion in a
              medium where the consistency of the medium changes a lot. When  two liquids are
              mixed the process of mixing is a diffusive process. Heat  propagates largely by
              diffusion. There are many examples of diffusive  processes where the
              consistency of the medium of propagation changes a lot.One  example is the
              propagation of oil through porous rock. Another is the  propagation of
              pollutants in the ground. In each of the above examples it is  important to
              build up a qualitative understanding of the mechanism of  difdusion in such
              media. This study will contribute to this,
