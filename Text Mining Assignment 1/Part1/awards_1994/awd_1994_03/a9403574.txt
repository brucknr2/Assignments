Abstract    :
              9403574  Tick  This award is to support a workshop on Parallel Logic and 
              Functional Programming and their Programming Environments, to be  held in March
              4-6, l994 at the University of Oregon, Eugene,  Oregon.  This workshop will
              host international researchers  working in the area of parallel programming
              languages, compilers  and environments.  The participation of researchers from
              ICOT  (Institute of New Generation Computer Technology) will be  sponsored by
              ICOT.  The workshop participants will participate in  stimulating discussions
              on concurrent computations, concurrent  run-time systems and concurrent
              programming environments for  logic and functional programming languages.  ***
