Abstract    :
              9403196  Banyaga        The research covers several topics in symplectic and 
              contact geometry which revolve around the method of the momentum  mapping and
              foliations. It is intended to study analogs of  Klein's Erlanger Program in
              contact geometry and the relationship  of the latter to instanton theory
              arising in mathematical  physics.  ***
