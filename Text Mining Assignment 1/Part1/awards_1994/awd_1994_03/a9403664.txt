Abstract    :
                   The objective of this research is the measurement of the size  and charge
              of ice particles in thunderstorms, a crucial ingredient  of existing theory of
              charge separation in such storms.  The  measuring devices, including a new one
              designed to evaluate the  reliability of the electrical measurements, will be
              mounted on a  balloon and flown near Socorro, New Mexico where special radars
              and  other instruments will provide a useful meteorological  characterization
              of the thunderstorms.
