Abstract    :
              9403365  Cruickshank    The conference will investigate the use of ion beams in
              the study  of basic condensed matter physics phenomena (such as particle 
              scattering) and the potential for analytical applications (such as  Rutherford
              backscattering and proton induced x-ray emission).  In  addition, the
              conference will feature the use of ion beams as tools  for the modification of
              materials (such as sputtering and  implantation).  The potential use of ion
              beams for tumor surgery  and for inducing other modifications in biological
              materials will  also be examined.    % % % %    The conference will investigate
