Abstract    :
              9403892  Ariyawansa  This project will develop and computationally test variants
              of  Davidon's collinear scaling algorithms that extend quasi-Newton  methods.
              These algorithms would be based on local approximations  that interpolate
              objective function values and gradients at  suitable iterates. They would be
              designed to have finite  termination on conic functions, and to be invariant
              under  collinear scalings.    The development of such algorithms would begin
              with the recent  new derivation of Davidon's collinear scaling algorithms by
              the  principal investigator.   The computational experiments would use 
              standard test problems as well as test instances derived from  suitable
              potential functions used in interior point methods.  The  proposed project
              would thus attempt to assess in an unbiased  manner whether algorithms that
              utilize the full potential offered  by Davidon's new scalings and
              approximations would have practical  performance improvements.    If the
              computational experiments indicate that algorithms with  Davidon's new scalings
              and approximationscan improve performance  in optimizing potential functions,
              then it would indicate a  hitherto unexplored way of developing better interior
              point  algorithms. Since interior point methods have wide applicability,  this
              work can reveal research opportunities that would make  significant
              advancements in optimization algorithms.  ***
