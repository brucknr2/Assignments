Abstract    :
                9403935  Larsen  This is an individual award for the Postdoctoral Research
              Fellowship in Plant Biology.  The applicant received her Ph.D. from the State
              University of New York at Stony Brook.  Her Ph.D. research was in the area of
              mammalian oncogenes.  She plans to carry out her postdoctoral fellowship
              research in the laboratory of Dr. Carolyn Silflow at University of Minnesota. 
              The proposed research entitled "Regulation of basal body positioning in
              Chlamydomonas" will expand the scientific experience of this Fellow into plant
              biology and cell biology.
