Abstract    :
                  This award will enable researchers at three institutions  (Rutgers, Mt.
              Sinai, and Rockefeller) to continue strengthening  and focusing their
              collaborative efforts in the area of  computational methods for analyzing
              genetic regulatory sequences.   Methods for sequencing nucleic acids have made
              available the fine  structure of many regions known to play a role in genetic 
              function.  Unfortunately, the automated recognition of sequence  signatures of
              these regions remains problematical.  This  multidisciplinary team of
              biologists, biochemists, and computer  scientists will focus on methods for
              searching for regions of  imputable biological activity in DNA sequence data.
