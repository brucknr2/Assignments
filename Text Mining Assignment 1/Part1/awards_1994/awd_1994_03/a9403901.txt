Abstract    :
                   This is a multi-faceted investigation whose primary focus is the 
              application of partial differential equations and their optimal control to 
              problems in mechanics,population dynamics, mathematical ecology and 
              mathematical physiology.  Among the problems to be investigated are bilinear 
              control of Kirchhoff plate equations;viscosity solutions of systems of systems 
              of degenerate parabolic partial differential equations that arise in 
              population dynamics; optimal control of a system of ordinary differential 
              equations which models the interaction of the immune system with the human 
              immunodeficiency virus (HIV) with the goal of devising an optimal scheduling 
              procedure for chemotherapy treatments; and optimal control of a model for 
              bioremediation of hazardous waste using the input pumping levels of nutrients 
              as the control variable. This project is jointly funded by the Applied 
              Mathematics Program and the Classical Analysis Program.       This is a
              multi-faceted investigation whose primary focus is the  application of partial
              differential equations and their optimal control to  problems in mechanics,
              population dynamics, mathematical ecology and  mathematical physiology. Among
              the specific problems to be investigated are  (1) the bilinear optimal control
              of plate equations, with applications to  control of elastic structures;  (2)
              an analysis of systems of partial  differential systems which model population
              dynamics, with applications to  competitive and cooperative scenarios in
              social, political, military, and  environmental situations; (3) optimal control
              of chemotherapy treatment  scheduling in a model which describes the
              interaction of the immune system  with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
              with the goal of reducing viral  replication rates; and (4) optimal control of
              hazardous waste disposal through  the process of bioremediation in which the
              control variable is the delivery  pattern of the essential nutrients that
              optimizes the efficiency of the  bioremediation process.  Th is project is
              jointly funded by the Applied  Mathematics Program and the Classical Analysis
              Program.
