Abstract    :
              9403566  O'Shaughnessy  Theoretical research will be conducted on free radical 
              polymerization, a method widely used in the synthesis of mass  produced
              polymers and many types of advanced polymeric materials.   The kinetics of free
              radical polymerization are intimately  associated with the static and dynamical
              properties of high polymer  solutions and melts through the process of
              termination of growing  living chains by interpolymeric reaction with one
              another.  A  systematic theory of free radical polymerization will be developed
               based on recent advances in the theory of interpolymeric reaction  rates which
              exploit concepts of scaling and universality.  The  principal quantities of
              practical and fundamental significance will  be evaluated.  This work will
              provide a basis for first principles  models of closely related methods such as
              emulsion polymerization  and will allow the interpretation of a large body of
              experimental  data on the properties of polymers in the liquid and glassy
              state.  %%%  Modern analytical and computational techniques will be applied to 
              the problem of free radical polymerization.  This is one of the  primary
              processing methods whereby polymeric materials are  produced, yet it has very
              little theoretical basis.  Thus, this  research will provide a fundamental
              understanding of this important  processing technique.  ***
