Abstract    :
              9403146  Leon  Dr. Jeffrey W. Leon has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral 
              Research Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Leon received his  doctoral degree from
              the University of Rochester under the  supervision of  Professor David Whitten.
              Dr. Leon will continue  research at Cornell University under the sponsorship of
               Professor Jean Frechet. His postdoctoral research will target  the synthesis
              and catalytic properties of a water-soluble  starburst dendrimer having a
              metalloporphyrin at the focal  point. This macromolecule will serve as a
              catalytic reaction  chamber for the epoxidation of olefins. Longer term, he
              will  study metalloporphyrin cored dendrimers as analogs of electron  transfer
              proteins.    The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is 
              viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to  broaden the
              knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract  them into meaningful
              careers in contemporary chemical research  and teaching.
