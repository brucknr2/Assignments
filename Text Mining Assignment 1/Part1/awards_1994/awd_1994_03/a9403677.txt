Abstract    :
              This proposal will test PES-51 for the in-situ bioremediation of  oil spill
              contamination. PES-51 is a surfactant derived from oil-  degrading bacteria. A
              bench-scale test program using contaminated  soil from McMurdo has been
              designed to be completed before field  testing can take place. The soil will be
              shipped to the  University of Alaska to test the feasibility of remediating 
              McMurdo soil using PES-51. A survey grid to determine the extent  and degree of
              contamination in McMurdo from past operations, both  horizontally and
              vertically has been designed.  This survey  will consist of two parts 1)a
              compilation of documentation of  fuel spills over the history of McMurdo
              Station, and 2) a  sampling program that includes: a)  preliminary mapping of
              those  areas around the station that are "clean" and to delineate  contaminated
              areas, b) a detailed sampling program in known  contaminated areas to determine
              the vertical and horizontal  extent of the contamination to the degree
              possible, and c) a "hot  spot" sampling program for small spills or isolated
              contamination  sites in otherwise clean areas.
