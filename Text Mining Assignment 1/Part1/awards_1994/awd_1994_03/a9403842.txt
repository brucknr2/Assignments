Abstract    :
              Chayes            This research involves the use of mathematical models  and
              analysis to study problems arising in materials research.   Three specific
              projects are to be studied.  The first concerns  the dynamical behavior of
              large droplets of one phase immersed in  a second.  The second project is a
              study of a recent model of  aerogels.  And the third project is a study of some
              problems of  first passage percolation.            This research involves the
              use of mathematical models  and analysis to study problems arising in materials
              research.   While the problems arise in materials research, new mathematics 
              will need to be developed to study these problems.  In  particular, tools from
              functional analysis and probability will  be useful. ***
