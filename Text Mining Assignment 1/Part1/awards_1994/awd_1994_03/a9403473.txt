Abstract    :
              This is a joint effort between two universities for rapid  prototyping of mobile
              computers.  The projects involve teams of  students who over the course of a
              semester design the hardware,  software, and packaging of mobile computer
              systems, and fabricate  prototypes by combining standard electronic parts with
              custom  fabricated cases and interconnect harnesses.  This project focusses 
              primarily on mobile computing for the diagnosis of  telecommunications
              networks.  Mobile computer systems that include  stationary and mobile
              computers, interface devices, and software,  are being designed and fabricated
              for these applications.  The  project goal is to systematize the prototyping
              process in several  ways:  by providing an integrated design tool that can 
              simultaneously represent electronic, thermal, and mechanical  constraints; by
              providing modular template architectures for mobile  computers; and by
              reporting on experience in the co-design of  software, mobile hardware, and
              stationary hardware in a mobile  computing system.
