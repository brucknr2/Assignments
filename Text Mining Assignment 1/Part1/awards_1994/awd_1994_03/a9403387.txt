Abstract    :
              This SBIR Phase II research focuses on a high energy device that can cut the
              skin and foam of an automotive instrument panel surface in an emergency
              activation of an airbag.   The cutting action is effected by the release of 
              stored chemical energy either by detonation and/or heat deflagration.    The
              fabrication concept uses a paint slurry printed onto the back surface of an
              instrument panel directly on  an intermediate membrane or on the airbag door
              substrate.   Current passenger airbag technology leaves a visible appearance of
              the airbag in the front surface of  and instrument panel.  The technology 
              under this award will improve safety, appearance, and flexibility in locating
              the cut without adverse effect on reliability of the airbag or on other
              instrument panel parameters.
