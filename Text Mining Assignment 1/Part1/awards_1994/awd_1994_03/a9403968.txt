Abstract    :
                9403968  Grace  This is an individual Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
              Plant Biology award.  The Fellow received his Ph.D. from Duke University.  His
              Ph.D. thesis research dealt with biochemistry and physiology of chloroplast
              metabolism.  He will carry out his postdoctoral fellowship research in the
              laboratory of Dr. William Adams at University of Colorado.  The proposed
              research is entitled "Assessing the role of active oxygen scavenging systems in
              protection of plants against high light stress in their natural environment" 
              The postdoctoral experience will expand his scientific expertise to
              physiological ecology.   The research training plan includes 6 month visit to
              the Australian National University in Canberra City.
