Abstract    :
              9403174  Shear  Dr. Jason B. Shear has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral 
              Research Fellowship in Chemistry.  Dr. Shear received his  doctoral degree from
              Stanford University under the supervision  of Professor Richard Zare. Dr. Shear
              will continue research at  Cornell University under the sponsorship of Profesor
              Watt Webb.  His postdoctoral research will involve technique development  and
              application of laser scanning fluoresence microscopy  imaging to study
              electrophysiological events in neurons. Longer  term, he plans to develop and
              utilize other fast analytical  techniques for characterizing dynamic chemical
              events in  biological systems.    The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in
              Chemistry Program is  viewed as an important infrastructural program designed
              to  broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract  them into
              meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research  and teaching.
