Abstract    :
              9403182  Siegel    This grant provides support for a conference on nanophase
              materials  held in Davos, Switzerland.  There is considerable interest in the 
              novel properties of nanophase materials.  These materials have  constituent
              phase or grain structure modulated on a length scale  less than 100 nanometers.
               They are artificially synthesized by a  wide variety of means.  This
              conference focuses on what is  presently poorly understood about the synthesis,
              structure,  properties and potential technological applications of these three-
               dimensionally modulated materials.  %%%  Nanophase materials have been shown
              to have unique mechanical and  physical properties.  The science is relatively
              new, and many  possibilities exist for their technological applications in 
              industry.  ***
