Abstract    :
              9403891  Hempel    The key to the operation of university research Centers that 
              interact with industry in a collaborative mechanism is the  formulation and
              implementation of an industrially relevant research  program.  There have been
              no reported studies on the discussion  process Center directors use in making
              the selection of projects  for a Center's research program.    This study will:
              1) investigate and document methods used by  successful directors for
              prioritization of Center research  projects; 2) investigate the heuristics
              employed by industry  members of Centers; and 3) examine the importance of
              timing of  project inputs and outputs to industry members in their selection 
              process.    The Principal Investigator is well qualified to perform this study.
                 The Program Manager recommends the University of Connecticut be  awarded
              $53,752 for eleven months for this project.
