Abstract    :
              9403830  Soffa     This grant supports the Solid-Solid Phase Transformations in 
              Organic Materials Conference to be held near Pittsburgh, PA, July  14-22, 1994.
               The requested funds are $10,000 to support graduate  student participation. 
              This international conference examines the  subject of solid -> solid phase
              transformations from both the  theoretical and experimental viewpoints in
              metallic, ceramic and  mineral systems.  The technical program includes 160
              presentations,  12 invited talks, and 4 plenary lectures.  Focus groups are
              formed  to discuss (1) mathematical approaches; (2) teaching; (3) first 
              principal calculations; (4) elastic effects during coarsening; (5)  plastic
              deformation effects.  Over 200 people are expected to  attend, including
              several NSF scientists and scientists from other  countries.  %%%  Solid state
              phase transformations affect the properties of  materials used in industrial
              applications.  A key to improving  materials is understanding the nature and
              effects of these  transformations.  The conference provides scientists and
              engineers  involved in practical applications of materials an opportunity to 
              familiarize themselves with new developments in the field.   ***
