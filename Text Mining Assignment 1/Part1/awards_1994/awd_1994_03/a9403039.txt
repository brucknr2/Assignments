Abstract    :
              9403039  Mushinsky   This U.S.-Mexico award will fund a workshop on North 
              American tortoises, to be held in the Mapimi Biosphere  Preserve, Durango,
              Mexico in October, 1994.   Organizers are Dr. Henry Mushinsky, University of 
              South Florida, and Dr. Gustavo Aguirre, Instituto de  Ecologia, Durango,
              Mexico.  The purpose of the  workshop is to exchange information about recent 
              advances in the understanding of the biology and  current management practices
              for the four species of  North American tortoises.  The exchange of information
               will be needed to protect existing populations, and  re-establish populations
              in areas formerly occupied by  the tortoises.    The rate of decline of all
              four North American species  of tortoises has increased over the last 30 years.
                The continuing loss and fragmentation of their  habitats by human activities,
              with the consequent  demographic and behavioral modifications caused by  these
              changes, may bring stress induced diseases and  push the species closer to
              extinction. Lack of a  unified approach to address the problems has slowed 
              progress of the conservation effort.  The workshop  will bring together
              individuals actively participating  in research in this area with the purpose
              of  increasing research collaboration that, ultimately,  will help to support
              and strengthen current  conservation efforts.   ***
