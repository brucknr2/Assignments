Abstract    :
              9403780  Hase  Wayne State Univ.  This project in the theory of chemical
              dynamics is supported by the NSF Theoretical and Computational Chemistry
              Program.  The investigator extends his broad, ongoing study of transition state
              theory, classical trajectory calculations, SN2 reactions, RRKM theory of
              unimolecular reactions, solvent effects, dynamics of gas-surface interactions,
              and further development and application of the VENUS computer program.  This
              project emphasizes direct dynamics (thereby avoiding the problem of fitting the
              global potential energy surface) and the treatment of quantum mechanical zero
              point energy effects in a classical mechanical formalism.    VENUS is a
              computer program, used by theoretical chemists at various institutions, to
              predict the rates of chemical reactions in gases, liquids, and at gas-surface
              interfaces using detailed knowledge of the intermolecular forces for the
              specific molecules in the chemical system.  The underlying theoretical
              principles and computational methods have been continuously developed over many
              years by numerous scientists with major contributions coming from the principle
              investigator's own research group.   This project attempts to compute the
              trajectories of atoms in the course of a chemical reaction without prior
              knowledge of the  potential energy surface (a mathematical function expressing
              the energy of any given geometical arrangement of atoms).  Instead, the
              instantaneous energy, and the associated interatomic forces, are recomputed at
              each step along the reaction path.  Improved computational methods need to be
              developed before such computations become generally practical.
