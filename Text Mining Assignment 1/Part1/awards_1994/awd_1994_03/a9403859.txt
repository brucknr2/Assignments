Abstract    :
                    Neuroimmunology is a rapidly emerging and expanding field of  research,
              propelled by recent findings that have provided evidence  that a number of
              molecules affect the growth and differentiation of  cells in both the immune
              system and the nervous system.  It is now  recognized that molecules once
              thought to have actions restricted  to the immune system directly affect the
              proliferation, growth, and  differentiation of nerve cells.  Similarly,
              molecules originally  identified because they function in the development of
              the nervous  system reciprocate by having effects in the immune system.  A
              major  goal of this conference, held under the auspices of the Federation  of
              American Societies for Experimental Biology,  is to bring  together scientists
              from diverse fields (such as immunology,  neuroscience, pharmacology, and
              psychology) to explore new ideas,  exchange information, and foster
              collaboration in the study of the  interactions between the nervous system and
              the immune system.
