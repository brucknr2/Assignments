Abstract    :
              Professor Alexeev will study varieties with log canonical  singularities.  In
              particular he intends to work on boundedness  theorems in the 3-dimensional
              case in an attempt to generalize  work of Kawamata and Mori on boundedness of
              Fano varieties.  This is research in the field of algebraic geometry. 
              Algebraic  geometry itself is one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, 
              but one which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past  quarter-century. 
              In its origin, it treated figures that could be  defined in the plane by the
              simplest equations, namely  polynomials.  Nowadays the field makes use of
              methods not only  from algebra, but from analysis and topology, and conversely
              is  finding application in those fields as well as in physics,  theoretical
              computer science, and robotics.
