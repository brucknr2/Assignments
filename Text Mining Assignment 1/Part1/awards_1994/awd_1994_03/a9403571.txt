Abstract    :
              9403571  Kumar  Semiconductor manufacturing is a complex process, involving 
              hundreds of steps of processing.  Wafer return several times to  many tools,
              leading to a highly re-entrant process flow.  This  proposal addresses the
              problems of efficient operation, analysis  and design of plants.  The goal is
              to advance the state-of-the  art on two important fronts: (1) Optimization of
              Cycle-Time  Performance, and (2) Performance Evaluation of Semiconductor 
              Manufacturing Plants.  This proposal pursues an approach of  studying the
              constraints on the mean value of certain random  variables.  It develops a
              programmatic procedure for obtaining  performance bounds, and illustrates its
              application to various  fab models and scheduling policies.  This approach can
              be used to  establish the stability, i.e. performance recurrence, and even  the
              boundedness of moments, of the Markov chain underlying the  system.  The
              research proposed in this proposal is application  driven, and uses a variety
              of tools ranging from simulations,  heuristics, and software development, to
              theory.  The goal is to  advance the state of the art in scheduling
              semiconductor fabs, as  well as the theoretical foundation of the proposed
              approach.  ***
