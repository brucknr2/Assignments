Abstract    :
              9403857  Rosenberg          The scope of research entails the study of heat flow
               techniques relative to Laplace type operators on Riemannian  manifolds. Some
              elements of stochastic differential geometry and  brownian motion will also be
              pursued along with the geometry of  the zeta function. Part of the scope
              involves projects with  undergraduates. The research has potential applications
              to  stochastic processes and mathematical physics.  ***
