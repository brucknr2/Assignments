Abstract    :
              9403195  Bernstein       A workshop on "Chiral Dynamics:  Theory and Experiment"
               has been organized for the week of July 25-29, 1994, at MIT.  The main
              objectives are: 1) to critically review the present  status of approximation
              techniques to QCD at low energies;  2) to review the experimental tests of
              these predictions;  and 3) to discuss further experimental and theoretical 
              opportunities.  The emphasis will be on the properties of  the pion (the almost
              Goldstone boson of QCD) and its  interactions.  ***
