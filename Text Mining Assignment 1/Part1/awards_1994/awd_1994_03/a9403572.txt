Abstract    :
              Professor Gregory Ezra is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and  
              Computational Chemistry Program to continue his work in theoretical   studies
              of few body dynamics.   Ezra applies quantum, classical and   semiclassical
              methodologies to investigate problems such as: 1) complex   formation in
              ion-molecule reactions with emphasis on proton transfer   reactions; 2)
              classical-quantum correspondence in coupled oscillator   systems; and 3)
              semiclassical theory of few-body Coulomb systems.  A   basic theme of Ezra's
              work is the relation between the classical and   quantum mechanics of
              nonintegrable systems such as molecular Hamiltonians   or multi-electron atoms.
                 The primary aim of Ezra's work is a detailed understanding of energy flow  
              within a molecule and its consequences for spectroscopy and chemical  
              kinetics.  Chemically useful correlations are being sought between the   shape
              of a molecular potential energy surface and the associated reactive   bound
              state dynamics.  These correlations will aid in gaining a deeper   fundamental
              understanding of chemical dynamics.
