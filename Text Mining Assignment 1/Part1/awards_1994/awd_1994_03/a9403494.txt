Abstract    :
              This SBIR Phase II award addresses laser crystallization of spin-on
              ferroelectric thin films for applications in ferroelectric non-volatile random
              access memories (FNVRAM).  This process affords precise control of temperature
              in fabrication of  lead zirconate titanate (PZT) ferroelectric thin films on
              large area aluminized silicon wafers.    Commercial applications of the
              technology included VLSIC manufacture and production of FVNRAMs,  surface
              acoustic wave filters, high speed packages, piezoelectric transducers,
              pyroelectric sensors, and electronic and electro-optic devices.
