Abstract    :
              9403612  Wight  The main objective of this project is to develop a design 
              strategy for the use of ductile steel bracing fro the seismic  upgrading of
              slab-column frame structures that are located in  moderate and high seismic
              zones.  To develop the design approach,  the experimental data obtained from
              the tests on a large scale  two-story by two-bay reinforced concrete
              slab-column framed and  from the test or slab-column connection assemblies and
              columns  jacketed with steel angles and plates will be analyzed and 
              synthesized.  The design strategy will utilize the strength and  stiffness
              contributions from the unbraced portions of the  existing slab-column
              structure.  The results will be presented in  a form that can be understood and
              used by practicing engineers.  ***
