Abstract    :
                          BOWEN  9403539  This Interagency Agreement supports activities of
              the  Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee (IARPC) for  which NSF has
              lead agency role.  These activities involve  editing and preparation of the
              camera copy of the Spring and  Fall 1994 issues of the Journal, Arctic Research
              of the  United States.  The journal serves an essential step in  fulfilling the
              requirements of Public Law 98-373, the Arctic  Research and Policy Act.  It
              contains information on  research activities of the Federal agencies involved
              in the  Arctic and reports and minutes of meetings from the Arctic  Research
              Commission and IARPC.  This action provides support  for preparation of the
              Journal and documentation of the  interagency programs for the 1990's.  ***
