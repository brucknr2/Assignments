Abstract    :
              9403049  Loehman    The compositions and structure of polynary oxide glasses
              free  of  classical   network  formers  and  containing  high-atomic-number 
              cations  will be investigated and related to selected properties,  including 
              efficiency  of  dopants for  optical  upconversion  or  amplification, 
              nonlinear refractive index, and  suitability  for  fiber  formation.  This
              proposal aims to explore in greater depth  the  existence,  preparation, 
              structure,  and  selected  optical  properties of oxide glasses free of the
              classical network formers  boron  oxide,  silica, germania, phosphorus and 
              arsenic  oxides.  The  two  primary motivations for this work are:  1) to 
              increase  our basic understanding of glass formation and structure, and  2)  to
              generate optical data for new glass forming systems.  Based on  the 
              characteristics of the component oxides,  the  physical  and  chemical 
              properties  of  the  new glasses  are  expected  to  be  suitable  for 
              practical applications.  Glasses made  from  these  oxides  are  of  interest
              as hosts for optically  active  dopants  because  currently available glasses
              have either good  mechanical  and  chemical properties or desirable optical
              properties, but not  both.  %%%  The compositions and structures of polynary
              oxide glasses free of  classical  network  formers  and containing  high 
              atomic  number  cations  will  be investigate and related to selected 
              properties  and suitability for fiber formation.  ***
