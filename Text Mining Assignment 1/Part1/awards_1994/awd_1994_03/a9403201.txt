Abstract    :
              9403201  This new proposal is to study strongly correlated systems using  newly
              developed renormalization group techniques.  The proposed  work is expected to
              provide some understanding of the validity  of Fermi liquid theory in two
              dimensions.  The techniques will  also be used to study effects of
              electron-electron repulsion  on the persistent current in mesoscopic rings. 
              %%%  One of the open questions in the study of strongly correlated  systems is
              whether the conventional Fermi liquid theory is  is valid in two-dimension. 
              The proposed research will use very  efficient numerical methods to resolve
              this question.  The work  will focus on high temperature superconductors and
              mesoscopic  rings.
