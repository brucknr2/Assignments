Abstract    :
              9403048  Qiu    This proposal is to study the current systems, water properties,
               and time and space variability north of the Hawaiian Ridge.  These  studies
              are aimed to understand the dynamics of the Ridge and how  it fits into, and
              modify the subtropical gyre.  Results on how the  Hawaiian Ridge affects the
              large scale circulation will let us to  understand how typical is the
              variability observed at the HOT  (Hawaiian Ocean Time series) site and how
              representative it is of  the variability of the gyre.  The study will be based
              on the  analysis of all available data in the area.  ***
