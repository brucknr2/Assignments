Abstract    :
                  9403204  Sadovnik      This is an SBIR Phase II award.  This project
              utilizes image  processing and liquid crystal display (LCD) technologies to
              provide  volume visualization displays.  The approach consists of a stored 
              image of a 3-D scene which is arranged as a sequence of sliced 2-D 
              cross-sections displayed in instantaneously switched LCD screens  with
              see-through capabilities.  The multiple LCD screen can be  switched
              instantaneously and synchronized from transparent to  scattering with a video
              projector which satisfies the persistence  of human vision in full color.  The
              hardware and software designs,  the laboratory experimental setup, and
              corresponding favorable  experimental results have been obtained and
              constructed under  funding from a prevous SBIR award.
