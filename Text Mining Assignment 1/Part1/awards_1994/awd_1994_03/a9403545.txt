Abstract    :
              Professor Clifford Dykstra is supported by a grant from the Theoretical   and
              Computational Chemistry Program to continue his research on the   analysis of
              dynamical features of weakly bound complexes.  Ab initio   electronic structure
              calculations are used for evaluating the intrinsic   electrical response
              properties of molecules.  The results of these   calculations are incorporated
              into a molecular mechanics model for   clusters, MMC, which can then be used to
              predict molecular structure and   dynamical properties of a larger clusters of
              molecular species.  The   primary goal of the work is a detailed, fundamental
              understanding of weak   interactions, including transferable potentials,
              electronic structure   changes, and dynamical manifestations.    Weak molecular
              interactions are important in problems ranging from   molecular clustering,
              certain surface phenomena, nonlinear optical   response of aggregations,
              aspects of protein structure, and drug design.    Dykstra's work is aimed at
              achieving reliable predictive capability for   structures and energetics of
              weak clusters, and for the changes in   properties of systems which experience
              weak inter- and intramolecular   interaction.
