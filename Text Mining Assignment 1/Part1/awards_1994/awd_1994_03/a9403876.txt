Abstract    :
              9403876  Klein       Pion absorption experiments will be completed at the PSI
              lab  in Switzerland, focusing on multiparticle reaction mechanisms  (through
              activities of the LADS collaboration)and medium  modifications of effective
              interactions (through polarized target  studies).  Research will be carried out
              in support of mounting  spin structure function measurement programs at SLAC
              and CEBAF.  At CEBAF this will include design and construction of drift- 
              chambers for the CEBAF CLAS detector.  ***
