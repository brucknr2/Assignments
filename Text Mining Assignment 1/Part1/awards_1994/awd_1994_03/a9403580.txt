Abstract    :
                The primary objectives concern the development and   analysis of  algorithms
              for linear programming within a complexity theory    motivated by functional
              analysis rather than the  traditional   motivated by algebra and combinatorics.
               Special attention is   given to  issues concerning computer  round-off error
              and inexact data,   issues such as how  one might  use the prior knowledge one
              has regarding the   structure of the  problem to be solved in order to
              efficiently solve the   problem  using less  computational precision than would
              be needed  otherwise.  The   use of iterative  methods for solving the 
              equations that arise when applying   methods is investigated, as is the
              possibility that the   algorithms are (nearly) optimal; optimality is
              investigated    via approximation theory.  Perturbation theory for linear   
              programming is being  developed.  Certain notions which have proven  useful in
              the   context of linear  programming are being investigated  in a more general
              context   multi-variate polynomials.  It is intended that all of the  
              investigations will  be carried out  with as much generality as is possible;
              for   example, the cones  defining non-negativity will not be required to be  
              polyhedral.
