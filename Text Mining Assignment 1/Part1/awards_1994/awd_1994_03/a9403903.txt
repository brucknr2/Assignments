Abstract    :
              9403903  Donald    This award, in the Small Grants for Exploratory Research
              mode,  investigates computational aspects of engineering design problems  that
              are amenable to tractable algorithmic solution.  In  particular, the focus is
              on determining the shape of  microelectromechanical (MEM) structures, given
              specifications of  their parameterized geometry and their functionality
              (parametric  design).  MEM structures are particularly suited for automated 
              parametric design because of (i) their highly specialized and  automated
              production process, which allows only a very limited  number of elementary
              structures; (ii) the rather simple geometry  and functionality of the devices;
              and (iii) the possibly large  number of devices produced simultaneously in one
              manufacturing  process.    In this exploratory research, actuator arrays for
              micro-  manipulation will be built based on single-crystal torsional 
              oscillators.  Optimization in design and fabrication will be  investigated,
              with the goal of determining if the generated forces  can be sufficient, for
              example, to move a piece of paper.  The  research will develop models for the
              mechanics and a theory of  manipulation, and efficient algorithms will be
              described for  evaluation.
