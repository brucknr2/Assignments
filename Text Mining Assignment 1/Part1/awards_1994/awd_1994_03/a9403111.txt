Abstract    :
              9403111  Schultz  Dr. Brian E. Schultz has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral 
              Research Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Schultz's doctoral degree  was from
              Harvard University under the sponsorship of Professor  Richard Holm. Dr.
              Schultz will continue research at the  California Institute of Technology under
              the sponsorship of  Professor Sunney Chan. Dr. Schultz's postdoctoral
              fellowship  will provide him with bio-inorganic training in protein  synthesis
              and purification, fast kinetics, and advanced  spectroscopic skills such as
              EPR, Resonance Raman and ENDOR.  Longer term,  he plans to study the role of
              redox-active metals  in protein folding and the ramifications on enzyme
              mechanisms  where redox-based conformational changes are used as allosteric 
              controls or in active ion transport.    The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships
              in Chemistry Program is  viewed as an important infrastructural program
              designed to  broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract 
              them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research  and teaching.
