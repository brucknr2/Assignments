Abstract    :
              9403518  Escher       The projects involve the study of harmonic and minimal
              maps  between spheres and their parametrization in terms of  representation
              theory. Other problems involve isoparametric  hypersurfaces in various space
              forms and the study of Einstein  structures. This research may have potential
              applications to  mathematical physics.  ***
