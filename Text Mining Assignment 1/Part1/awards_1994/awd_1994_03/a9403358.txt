Abstract    :
              9403358  Nanni      A conference/workshop on Composite Materials for
              Construction  will be organized by a steering committee composed of seven 
              experts.  Selected speakers will be asked to participate.  The  conference will
              include five sessions addressing:  non-  prestressed reinforcement for
              concrete, prestressed reinforcement  for concrete and cables, repair and hybrid
              systems, structural  shapes, and laminates.  The goal of the conference is to
              provide  the basic understanding and research needs in the engineering 
              background for use of advanced composites in construction.  The  basic research
              will facilitate their introduction in the market  place in a safe, efficient,
              and timely fashion.  ***
