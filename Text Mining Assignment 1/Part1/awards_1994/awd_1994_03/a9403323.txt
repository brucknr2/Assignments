Abstract    :
              9403323  Emlen     Males in natural populations of the dung beetle Onthophagus 
              acuminatus (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) occur in two discrete forms:  those
              larger than a "critical" size have a pair of large frontal  horns, a deeply
              indented prothorax, and wide heads with an upturned  frontal lip while males
              smaller than the "critical" size lack  horns, have a smooth prothorax, and a
              narrower head without frontal  lip.  The developmental basis of this
              morphological dimorphism in  males will be investigated by examining larval
              hormonal and growth  processes that underlie horn expression and other
              developmentally  linked traits correlated with horn morphology.  %%%  Effects
              of (proximate) developmental mechanisms on directions of  (ultimate) phenotypic
              evolution will be revealed by the research.   This study of condition- or
              environment-sensitive expression of  developmental morphology sets the stage
              for greater understanding  of the relationship between microevolutionary change
              and  macroevolution.  Such knowledge enhances our appreciation of the  Earth's
              biodiversity and how it came into existence.  Generally,  studies of insect
              developmental patterns have potential for guiding  safe but effective
              biological control strategies.  ***
