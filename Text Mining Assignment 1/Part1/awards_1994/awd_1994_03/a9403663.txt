Abstract    :
              9403663  Gusfled    This grant is for the partial support of the conference on
              "Combinatorial Pattern Matching (CPM)", to be held at the Asilomar conference
              center, Monterey California, June 5-8, 1994.    Combinatorial pattern Matching
              addresses issues of searching and matching of strings and more complicated
              patterns such as trees, regular expressions, extended expressions.  It also
              addresses issues such as the discovery of unknown pattern in strings and the
              reconstruction of strings from partial pattern information.  The goal of the
              field is to derive nontrivial combinatorial properties for such structures and
              then to exploit these properties in order to achieve superior performances for
              the corresponding computational problems.  The conference focuses on original
              work in all areas related to combinatorial pattern matching and sequence
              analysis, both theoretical and applied.  Areas include, but are not limited to,
              string algorithms, pattern recognition, applications to molecular and
              evolutionary biology, text searching, information retrieval, symbolic computing
              and data compression.    ***   v       s  t
