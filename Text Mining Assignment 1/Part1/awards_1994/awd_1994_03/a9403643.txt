Abstract    :
              9403683  Felder   This Phase II SBIR project is for the efficient collection and
              separation of ultra-fine particles from carrier gas streams.  The proposed
              process should classify and separate these ultra-fine particles by their size. 
              It uses a supersonic jet to carry the particles to a gas counterflow region
              where the particles separate into a collection region by virtue of their
              momentum.  The proposed method would permit the separation and collection of
              pure solid particles resulting from combustion or other synthesis methods,
              including those resulting in high gas temperatures.  The commercial
              applications of this process, if successful, would range from particle
              collection from combustion synthesis to the replacement of filters, cyclones,
              or precipitators.
