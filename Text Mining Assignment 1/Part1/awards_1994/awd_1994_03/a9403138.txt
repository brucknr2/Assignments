Abstract    :
              9403138  LaPointe  Dr. Anne M. LaPointe has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral 
              Research Fellowship in Chemistry.  Dr. LaPointe received her  doctoral degree
              from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  under the supervision of
              Professor Richard Schrock. Dr.  LaPointe will continue her research at the
              University of North  Carolina under the sponsorship of Professor Maurice
              Brookhart.  Her postdoctoral research will focus on the design and  synthesis
              of the beta-diketonate complexes of cobalt, rhodium  and iridium as catalysts
              for olefin oligomerization and  polymerization. Longer term she plans to
              investigate cationic  platinum(II) and palladium(II) perfluoroalkyl complexes
              as  catalysts for the polymerization of perfluoroolefins.    The Postdoctoral
              Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is  viewed as an important
              infrastructural program designed to  broaden the knowledge and experience of
              new Ph.D.s and attract  them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical
              research  and teaching.
