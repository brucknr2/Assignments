Abstract    :
              9403071  Diver  Dr. Steven T. Diver has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral 
              Research Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Diver received his  doctoral degree from
              the University of Wisconsin-Madison under  the supervision of Professor Edwin
              Vedejs. Dr. Diver will  continue research at Harvard University under the
              sponsorship  of Professor Stuart Schreiber. His postdoctoral research will 
              target the total synthesis of resinaferatoxin. In the course of  the work he
              will develop skills in 2D-NMR, flow cytometry, gel  electrophoresis, protein
              separation and purification and  radioisotope labelling. Longer term he will
              study the  stabilization of DNA-topoisomerase II "cleavable complex" by  UCT4B.
              This research, important to the understanding of why DNA  double strands break,
              will require the total synthesis of UCT4B  as well as some analogs.    The
              Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is  viewed as an
              important infrastructural program designed to  broaden the knowledge and
              experience of new Ph.D.s and attract  them into meaningful careers in
              contemporary chemical research  and teaching.  ***
