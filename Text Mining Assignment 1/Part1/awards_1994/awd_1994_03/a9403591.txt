Abstract    :
              9403591  Virkar    The principal objective of this work is to examine the role
              of  aliovalent dopants on the kinetics of phase transformation in  ceramics.  A
              study of the kinetics of diffusional phase  transformations in ceramics with
              emphasis on dopants and/or  atmosphere, is important for several reasons:  1)
              determination of  phase equilibria; 2) kinetic stabilization of the desired
              phase;   3) morphology of phase separation and 4) phase transformation 
              theories.  Research is proposed on two types of systems; oxides  with one
              cation sublattice or two cation sublattices.  By  controlling the
              transformation and degree of order, it may be  possible to tailor the diffused
              phase transition and the dielectric  response in materials like potassium
              tantalate niobate and lead  scandium tantalate.    %%%    A theoretical and
              experimental study of interdiffusion with  emphasis on dopants is proposed. 
              The ability to control the  diffusion coefficient through defect chemistry has
              both scientific  and practical implications.  ***
