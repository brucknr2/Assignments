Abstract    :
              9403723  Pesin       The proposed topics for research are in the general area of
               dynamical systems and include the study of stochastic behavior of 
              trajectories for certain finite dimensional systems and for  dissipative
              dynamical systems with singularities having  attractors which are close to
              hyperbolic attractors. This  research has potential applications to areas of
              mathematical  physics where dynamical sytems models are relevant and also to 
              the theory of fractals and chaos.  ***
