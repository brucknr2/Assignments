Abstract    :
                9403947  Schrick  This is an individual Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
              Plant Biology award.  The Fellow received her Ph.D. from University of
              Washington.  For her Ph.D. thesis research, she studied molecular biology in
              yeast.  She will carry out her postdoctoral fellowship research in the
              laboratory of Dr. Gerd Jurgens at University of Munich in Germany.  The
              proposed research is entitled "Genetic control of the formation of the
              hypocotyl within the developing Arabidopsis embryo".  The postdoctoral
              experience will expand her scientific expertise to plant biology and will
              contribute to her growth as a member of the world-wide plant biology community.
