Abstract    :
              9403263  Chu     Cardueline finch (subfamily Carduelinae, family Fringillidae) 
              species exhibit considerable interspecific differences in plumage  colors, and
              extent to which it varies with age.  Comparative  methods will be employed to
              test hypotheses about the evolution of  plumage coloration patterns among
              cardueline lineages: cladistic  analyses will be performed on morphological and
              behavioral  characters.  That framework will then serve to anchor further 
              research on the evolution of plumage characters (including their  variation
              with age) and the evolution of carotenoid - based color  displays.  %%%  More
              is known of control and function of plumage coloration in  cardueline finches
              than for any other group of passerine birds, but  investigation into even this
              group have been hampered by the lack  of a robust phylogeny.  Substantial
              progress with this taxon will  provide a procedural model for similar analyses
              of additional taxa  in the future, and as a demonstration of the puissance of
              rigorous  systematic methods in elaborating evolutionary "adornment" among 
              vertebrate fauna.  Systematics provides a fundamental "guide" for  study of
              other facets of any given taxon's biology, within the  context of the planet's
              overwhelming biodiversity.  ***
