Abstract    :
              9403866  Lipton       We address the design of composite materials and their 
              application to optimal design of structures. Here we investigate  the
              macroscopic properties for perfectly and imperfectly bonded  composites as well
              as optimal transport properties for  multi-phase emulsions and foams. On a
              theoretical level this work  involves basic research in homogenization theory,
              perturbation  theory, and gamma convergence of nonlinear functionals. The 
              ultimate goal is the creation of efficient numerical methods for  optimal
              design of structures built from composite materials.  In  this proposal we
              treat several topics involving the use of  composites in optimal structural
              design. Composite materials and  their transport properties are central to the
              design of  structures ranging from the aeroelastic tayloring of airplane  wings
              to optimal design of emulsions. The design approach put  forth here focuses on
              finding the best composite material  properties necessary for optimal
              structural performance. This  program has immediate application to diverse
              areas ranging from  design of fuel efficient transportation systems to the
              modeling  of transport properties of biological materials.
