Abstract    :
              9403646  Akyildiz    Technical Narrative:    This project represents a
              collaborative research effort  between the Georgia Institute of Technology and
              Bilkent  University in Ankara, Turkey.  The investigators are  electrical
              engineers who propose to solve the problems  involved in end-to-end modeling
              and analysis for admission  control in ATM networks.  The project will advance
              the  technology so that an appropriate admission control  algorithm can be
              designed based on model predictions.   The  investigators (Drs. Ian Akyildiz
              from the Georgia Institute  of Technology and Erdal Arikan from Bilkent
              University) will  study the efficacy of the call admission algorithms while 
              utilizing results from the end-to-end models.  They intend  to exploit the
              special control features that can be provided  by an ATM network.  Using these
              control features, they can  allow a higher layer application to adapt to the
              state of  the network.  Project funding will enable Dr. Akyildiz to  work
              jointly with Dr. Arikan in the laboratory facilities at  Bilkent University for
              two months per year over the course  of this three-year study.    This project
              in computer science and engineering fulfills  the program objective of
              advancing scientific knowledge by  enabling leading experts in the United
              States and Turkey to  combine complementary talents and conduct research in
              areas  of strong mutual interest and competence.  ***
