Abstract    :
              With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program Professors Parson and   Kolis of
              Clemson University will develop new routes to the synthesis of   commercially
              important chemicals using supercritical water as a solvent.   This
              environmentally  benign synthesis proposal emphasizes the scope and  
              mechanisms of metal catalyzed oxidations of small organic molecules in  
              supercritical water.  A collaborative effort with Professor Myrick at the  
              University of South Carolina will involve in situ Raman spectroscopy  
              monitoring of the reactions taking place in supercritical water. Eastman  
              Kodak will offer advice by  identifying critical needs for better methods   to
              produce industrially important compounds.    This research will address an area
              of strategic importance in the   chemical industry. The project will explore
              the fundamental chemistry   that occurs when small carbon containing compounds
              are oxidized in a   reactor using supercritical water( a unique form of water
              at high   temperature and pressure) in the presence of metal ion catalysts. The
              use   of supercritical water to replace organic solvents shows  promise in the 
               reduction of  environmental pollution and the generation of hazardous  
              wastes.
