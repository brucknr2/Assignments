Abstract    :
              9403799  Sandler    The "Second International Symposium on Thermodynamics in 
              Chemical Engineering and Industry" will be held in Beijing,China  from May
              24-27, 1994.  It will be the first major conference to  be held in China soley
              on thermodynamics, phase equilibrium, and  separations processes in six years. 
                An important feature of the 1994 Symposium is that it will be  truly
              international in nature.  Indeed, in addition to the  twelve U.S. university
