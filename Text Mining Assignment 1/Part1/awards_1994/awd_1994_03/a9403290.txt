Abstract    :
              9403290  Thomson     Factors contributing to the distribution of subalpine
              meadows  and forests in western Colorado will be studied in an attempt to 
              establish firm intellectual connections between population  processes and
              landscape patterns in the ecological sciences.  Disturbance and herbivory by
              the pocket gopher, Thomomys talpoides,  serve as the foci of the investigation.
               Manipulations of pocket  gopher densities will be compared using sonic
              deterrence and  trapping on plots set out in a factorial design.  Seismic
              sensing  will be used to evaluate the hypothesis that forest - meadow  ecotones
              are driven by subsurface rock profiles that limit gopher  activity.  Spatial
              autocorrelation methods will be employed to  relate shallow seismic profiles to
              indices of vegetation and gopher  activity.  Specialists in landscape ecology,
              geographic information  systems (GIS), and spatial statistics will be
              consulted.  %%%  Results will serve as a basis for designing long - term
              studies of  gopher exclusion at ecotones (an ecotone is a transition area that 
              bounds two adjacent ecological community types, such as forest and  grassland).
               The work has implications for land use policy, given  that current use in the
              region consists of a mosaic of residential  development, wilderness, tourism,
              grazing, and timbering, all of  which are affected by large scale factors of
              logging, fire,  avalanches and snow - creep, and grazing (by both native
              ungulates  and livestock).  The surmise that as plant predators, pocket 
              gophers have potent effects on ecological succession is thus far  relatively
              untested.  ***
