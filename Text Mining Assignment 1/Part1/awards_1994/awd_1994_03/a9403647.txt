Abstract    :
              9403647  Weller  The LAII Science Management Office, located at the  University
              of Alaska Fairbanks, is part of the LAII-Flux  Study, but is also involved in
              the integration and coordination of the Flux Study within the broader aspects
              of LAII, and indeed the entire Arctic System Science program of NSF.  The SMO
              will also establish connections to other international programs of global
              change research in the Arctic.  The SMO will facilitate project planning and 
              integration by providing active scientific leadership and coordination service
              to the LAII projects, by holding science planning and synthesis meetings,
              providing communications between PIs and ensuring linkages to related programs.
               Specifically, long-term science plans for the Flux Study will be developed,
              modeling and data management requirements  will be specified in the context of
              the overall ARCSS  program, and logistics needs will be coordinated.  The SMO
              will be advised by an Executive Committee of four, including the director of
              the SMO, and a Steering Committee of both external members and LAII PIs.  The
              establishment of the LAII Science Management Office is in response to a
              recommendation from the NSF review panel for the LAII Flux Study.  ***
