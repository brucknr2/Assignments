Abstract    :
              9403376  Heiman    Technical abstract:  The 11th Conference on the Application
              of High  Magnetic Fields in Semiconductor Physics will be held on the MIT 
              campus August 8-12, 1994.  This is a satellite conference of the  International
              Conference on the Physics of Semiconductors taking  place in Vancouver.  The
              use of high magnetic fields is an  indispensable tool for probing new
              semiconductor materials and  structures, and has been useful in designing
              practical devices.   The meting will have impact in areas of research on
              electronic,  magnetic and photonic devices.  It will bring together an 
              outstanding international group of who are at the forefront of  scientific
              research and state of the art technology.    Non-technical abstract:  The 11th
