Abstract    :
              9403918  Spruck       The scope of research involves several topics in the 
              geometry and analysis of classes of partial differential  equations arising in
              geometry and physics. Among these are  included cosmological string solutions
              of the Einstein-Yang-  Mills-Higgs equations and topics in the theory of
              vortices.  This research involves potential applications to gauge field  theory
              in mathematical physics and soliton theory.  ***
