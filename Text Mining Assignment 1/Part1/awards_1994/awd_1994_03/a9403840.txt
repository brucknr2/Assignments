Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  9403840  Richard Masel    This is a combined experimental and
              theoretical study of the structure sensitivity of catalytic reactions on metal
              surfaces.  Ultrahigh-vacuum surface spectroscopic techniques are used to
              examine the interactions of simple hydrocarbon ligands with a series of
              platinum single crystals that expose various index planes.  The experimental
              observations are compared to the results of density functional calculations,
              and the process iterated by designing new experiments to test predictions of
              the theoretical calculations.  The objective is to identify the key
              interactions that control the reactions of hydrocarbons and describe how those
              interactions vary from one crystal face to another.    It has long been known
              that catalytic activities for various reactions on metals vary from one crystal
              face to another; in  many cases, the distribution of exposed planes is a
              predicter of selectivity.  While some extreme cases can be explained by crude
              steric or geometric arguments, there is no satisfactory theoretical framework
              to address this issue, which is critical  for many processes in the chemical,
              pharmaceutical, and fuel industries.  This effort addresses that need.  ***
