Abstract    :
              9403851  Jensen       This award supports mathematical research on problems in 
              differential geometry.  The work focuses on Dupin hypersurfaces  and deformable
              surfaces in Lie Sphere geometry.  Efforts will be  made to determine whether or
              not there exist minimal surfaces  with constant negative Gaussian curvature in
              the complex  projective plane.  The problems involve special submanifolds of 
              great interest; their solutions involve a combination of  techniques arising in
              the study of systems of partial  differential equations combined with geometric
              structures.   Applications of the work may be expected in mathematical physics 
              as well as geometry.       Differential geometry is a branch of mathematics 
              which combines methods of analysis with geometric motivation.   The problems
              often derive from those of the physical world such  as would be found in
              studies of relativity, turbulence,  dynamical systems and chaos.  ***
