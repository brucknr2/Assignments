Abstract    :
              IBN 94-03719  McSweeney                                           Abstract   
              Responding is not constant within experimental sessions when  animals respond
              on operant-conditioning procedures.  Instead, responding often begins slowly,
              increases to a peak  and then decreases throughout the rest of the session. 
              Dr.  McSweeney will try to determine why these changes occur.  In  particular,
              her experiments are designed to separate the  contribution of factors related
              to reinforcement, such as  arousal followed by satiation, from the contribution
              of  central factors, such as the focusing and waning of  attention.    These
              experiments are important for both theory and method  for two reasons.  (1)
              Many experiments in operant psychology  are not designed so that their data can
              be interpreted if  such within-session changes in responding occur.  (2) Rate 
              of responding averaged over the session is one of the  primary dependent
              variables in operant psychology.  Finding  systematic changes in responding
              within sessions suggests  that this measure ignores important changes in
              behavior at a  more detailed level.    Improving theory and methods in operant
              psychology has  important practical benefits.  Operant techniques are used  as
              methods for determining the effects of physiological  variables (for example,
              in the pharmaceutical industry) and  as the basis for some forms of therapy for
              human behavioral  problems.
