Abstract    :
              9403362  Wang  A research planning grant will support evaluation of the 
              feaqibility of developing failure maps for tribological surfaces  in conformal
              contact, including development of a model that takes  microstructural
              parameters, as well as flash temperature,  operating conditions, and general
              bulk properties into account.  ***
