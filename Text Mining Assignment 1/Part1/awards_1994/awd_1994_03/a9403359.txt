Abstract    :
              9403359  Lau  This is an award to support conduct of a conference on the 
              quality of models used to characterize the movement of  contaminants in
              groundwater.  This conference is being  jointly supported by the Environmental
              Protection Agency and  involves participation by other Federal agencies,
              Principal  Investigators of projects supported by the National Science 
              Foundation and a consortium of six water research institutes  in the Pacific
              Northwest and Oceania (Hawaii, Alaska,  Guam/Micronesia, Idaho, Oregon and
              Washington).    Results of this conference are expected to provide guidance  in
              providing support for research needed to improve the  efficacy and utility of
              groundwater models now used in  engineering design of systems for remediation
              of  contaminated groundwater.  ***
