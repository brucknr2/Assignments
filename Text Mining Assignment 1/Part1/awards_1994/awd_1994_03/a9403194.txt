Abstract    :
              9403194  Hughes       This award provides 50 % of the funding necessary to 
              acquire a new x-ray powder diffractometer that will be  installed and operated
              in the Department of Geology at Miami  University (Ohio). The University is
              committed to providing  the remaining 50% of the cost of acquiring this
              instrument  system.       The new x-ray powder diffractometer will replace an 
              outmoded 1970 instrument and will be the only such  instrument on the Miami
              campus. The diffractometer system  will be used in research projects that
              include : 1)  structural studies of minerals, 2) studies of disorder in 
              intermetallic alloys and their hydrides, 3) studies of  minerals in the
              low-temperature weathering environment, 4)  studies of the source and transport
              of carbonate sediments ,  and 5) investigations of clay minerals related to
              their use  in potassium-argon and rubidium-strontium dating methods.  The
              diffractometer will also be used in graduate and  undergraduate teaching.  ***
