Abstract    :
              9403822  Altiok       This workshop is focused on manufacturing problems in the 
              pharmaceutical industry.  The objective of the workshop is to bring  together
              people in academia and industry with an interest in the  pharmaceutical
              industry to discuss and exchange ideas which, if  developed and applied, can
              improve the level of system automation,  productivity, and quality control in
              the industry.  The conference  will identify the research needs of the industry
              in the area of  manufacturing for the year 2000 and beyond.       One outcome
              of the workshop will be an identification of  critical research areas in the
              industry by people who are actively  involved in the industry.  Second, a
              thorough discussion of the  state of automation in the industry will be held. 
              This will help  industry attendees assess where they belong in the automation 
              scale.  Finally, the role of academia and industry in developing  United States
              competitiveness in the industry through research can  be established.  This may
              lead to partnerships between universities  and the industry to work together on
              problems of common interest.
