Abstract    :
              Mittelman       The main emphasis of the project is the development of 
              computational techniques, their implementation on advanced  computer
              architectures, and their verification and utilization on  nontrivial
              application problems of current interest.  The area of  research is capillary
              flows and surfaces.  The investigator  analyzes in detail static capillary
              surfaces in singular cases and  searches for new surfaces with certain
              properties such as  symmetry.  A sophisticated computer code for partial
              differential  equations, to which he has contributed (PLTMG), is generalized to
               the Navier-Stokes equations.  Flows in which capillary effects are  prominent
              are analyzed, including mixed buoyant-thermocapillary  convection as it occurs
              in crystal growth and welding.       The force that shapes waterdrops, lets
              nutrients rise to  treetops, and is governing the flow of contaminated
              groundwater is  called capillarity.  While it is important in our terrestrial 
              environment, it becomes dominant in the microgravity regime of  space.  Many
              environmental but also manufacturing issues, such as  crystal growth and
              welding, will greatly benefit from a better  understanding of the effects of
              capillarity.  With state-  of-the-art computational techniques and resources
              the investigator  studies both the shape of liquid surfaces and the flow inside
               liquids.  Challenging problems of current interest serve as  paradigms and
              applications for the work.
