Abstract    :
              9403119  Sheares  Dr. Valerie V. Sheares has been awardea an NSF Postdoctoral 
              Research Fellowship in Chemistry.  Dr. Sheares received her  doctoral degree
              from the University of North Carolina at Chapel  Hill under the supervision of
              Professor Joseph DeSimone.  Dr.  Sheares will continue research at the
              University of Mainz under  the sponsorship of Professor Reimund Stadler. Her
              postdoctoral  training will introduce her to  the optimization and  large-scale
              synthesis of polymer-grade aminoisoprene monomers  and their subsequent living
              polymerization with the objective  of controlling the molecular weight,
              molecular weight  distribution and homopolymer microstructure. Longer term, she
               plans to study structure/property relationships in a new family  of ionomers
              with ionic groups spaced at regular intervals along  the chains. Homo-, block
              and star block ionomers will  be  synthesized and characterized.    The
              Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is  viewed as an
              important infrastructural program designed to  broaden the knowledge and
              experience of new Ph.D.s and attract  them into meaningful careers in
              contemporary chemical research  and teaching.
