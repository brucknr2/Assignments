Abstract    :
              9403464  Cermak  The College of Notre Dame requests support from NSF for 
              connection of their campus networks to SURAnet.  SURAnet is the  midlevel
              network located in the southeastern United States.  It  will provide operations
              management and information services and  it will give the College of Notre Dame
              a 56 thousand bits per  second connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45
              million  bits per second) National Backbone network.    Students and faculty
              research will benefit from the link.  By  linking to the mid-level and national
              networks, the College of  Notre Dame's faculty and academics will maintain a
              position of  leadership in research and educational innovation by profiting 
              from remote access to super computer centers, data bases and  information
              services, high speed communications, file transfer  and remote login, and
              access to library resources. This is also a  unique opportunity for the school
              to explore innovative  educational resources.
