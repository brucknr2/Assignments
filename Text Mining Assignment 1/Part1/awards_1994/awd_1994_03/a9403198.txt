Abstract    :
              Under the direction of Dr. Randall McGuire, Mr. Brian Thomas will  collect data
              for his doctoral dissertation. He will analyze  material from the historic
              period site of the Hermitage  Plantation in Tennessee.  This was the home of
              Andrew Jackson.  The work itself will involve analyzing artifacts and faunal 
              remains recovered from three slave cabins which are located at  varying
              distances from the main plantation house. Historic  documents indicate that
              status differences existed not only  between "masters" and "slaves", but also
              among the latter group.  Differences in job were related to both social and
              economic  status. Social position was reflected in residential distance as 
              well. Given the fairly controlled context, it will be possible to  examine
              different classes of artifacts - ceramics, personal  belongings, faunal and
              floral remains - and determine how well  power and status relations are
              reflected in their distribution  across the site.    This research is important
              for several reasons. Much  anthropological archaeology is directed at the
              reconstruction of  past social systems and the examination of status 
              differentiation. Mr. Thomas' provides a context to evaluate  analytic
              assumptions which anthropologists widely hold and to  test the efficacy of
              specific techniques which are used in social  reconstruction. It will also
              assist in the training of a  promising young scientist.
