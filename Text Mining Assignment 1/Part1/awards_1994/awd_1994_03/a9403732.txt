Abstract    :
              9403732  Tilly          This  is  an award under the Grants for Improving 
              Doctoral  Dissertation  Research program.  It is a study  of  the  role  of 
              prominent  intellectuals  in  the  consolidation  of  the   Cuban  revolution 
              after 1959.  Data will be collected from analysis  of  newspaper  and magazine
              articles, from organizational  membership  lists,  and  through oral history
              interviews in order to  analyze  the  social  networks that linked Cuban
              intellectuals during  the  years  between  1959  and  1966.  The resulting 
              data  on  social  networks among Cuban intellectuals will be used to illuminate
              how  the  structures of power were altered in that society as a result  of the
              revolution.        Previous  work  on revolutions tends to underemphasize  the 
              processes   by  which  the  power  of  the  new  rulers   becomes 
              consolidated.    By   focusing  on  that   period   and   process 
              specifically,  this  project will help us better  understand  the  social 
              basis  and roots of the Cuban revolution.   This  project  will  also  form a
              useful basis for an attempt to understand  how  different revolutions compare
              and contrast.  In addition  to  the  scientific gains to be achieved by the
              research, this award  will  materially  assist  a  highly  promising  student 
              in  completing  research for the Ph. D. dissertation.  Thus it contributes to
              the  future  scientific  manpower  of  the  nation  and  the  thorough 
              training of the next generation of social scientists.  ***
