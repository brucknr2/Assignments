Abstract    :
              9403409  Purdy       The distribution and characteristics of microearthquake 
              activity across the Endeavour segment of the Juan de Fuca  ridge will be
              studied by deploying a network of 15 ocean  bottom seismometers for a two month
              period.  The array will  span the axial valley in the vicinity of the main vent
              field  and the western flanks out to about 15 km.  The objectives  of the
              experiment are to characterize the distribution and  nature of offaxis
              microearthquake activity and to use these  data to evaluate and refine existing
              models of the tectonic  evolution of yound oceanic crust as it moves off axis,
              and  to estimate the depth of the brittle-ductile transition from  the maximum
              depth of seismicity as a function of distance  from the ridge axis.  ***
