Abstract    :
              This proposal considers problems in the area of optimal choice of  observation
              times for a random process. Bayesian inference and  decision theory provide a
              general and successful theoretical  framework. Within this framework, the goal
              of the proposed  research is to seek advances in important application areas.
              In  particular, goals are: To lay the groundwork for Bayesian dynamic 
              adjustment of sampling frequency in monitoring a random process  for control
              and other purposes; to study models for detecting the  presence of conditions
              that do not manifest naturally; and to  study design problems in which the goal
              of taking observations is  learning about process parameters.    Acquiring
              information about random phenomena over time is often  costly and hard.
              Efficiency can be substantially enhanced by  careful choice of observation
              times. The proposed research  examines specific applications in the hope of a)
              providing  solutions to pressing practical problems; b) indicating general 
              strategies. Examples of applications include timing of screening  exams for the
              early detection of cancer; designing tests for  improving software reliability;
              efficient monitoring in  meteorology, seismology and environmental sciences;
              efficient  implementation of process control and quality control in 
              manufacturing; regulation of airplane maintenance and others.
