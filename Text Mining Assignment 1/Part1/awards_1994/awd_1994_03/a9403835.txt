Abstract    :
              9403835  Boyce    The American Astronomical Society (AAS) will produce an
              on-line  version of its refereed research publication, The Astrophysical 
              Journal Letters (ApJL), and will develop innovative procedures and  new tools
              to enhance the users' capability to make full and  effective use of research
              results.  When this pioneering project,  the first to use a major journal, is
              completed there will be an  electronic version of ApJL, complete with on-screen
              representation  of mathematics and figures.  It will incorporate tools to
              search  for relevant articles, to cross-link to the abstracts of other 
              referenced articles, and to provide direct access to the underlying  data in
              forms which can be used for future research when possible.
