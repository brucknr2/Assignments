Abstract    :
                9403959  Evans  This is an individual Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
              Plant Biology award.  The applicant received his Ph.D. from University of
              Pennsylvania.  For his Ph.D. thesis research, he worked in the area of
              developmental biology in plants.  He will carry out his postdoctoral fellowship
              research in the laboratory of Dr. Jerry Kermicle at University of Wisconsin. 
              The proposed research is entitled "Genetic analysis of female gametophyte
              development in maize", which will expand his scientific expertise to genetics
              and evolutionary biology.
