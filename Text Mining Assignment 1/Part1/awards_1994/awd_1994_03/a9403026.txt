Abstract    :
              9403026  Zeng    This award supports the travel expenses for Dr.  Xiao Zeng,
              Department of Chemistry at the  University of Nebraska at Lincoln, to spend 
              four months conducting research with Professor  Koichiro Nakanishi in the
              Division of Molecular  Engineering at Kyoto University. The research  entails
              studies of phase equilibria and  nucleation in fluids.    The kinetics of gas
              to liquid phase transition  starts from a nucleation process which involves 
              the passage from a metastable state over a  barrier to reach a
              thermodynamically stable  phase.  Using classical nucleation theory, 
              discrepancies in temperature   dependence rates remain unexplained. Recently, 
              two-dimensional systems, such as monolayers,  permit the study at the
              microscopic level of  the kinetics of the phase transition.  This  project will
              allow Dr. Zeng, who recently has  worked on a variety of problems in the 
              materials sciences involving the application of  statistical mechanical methods
              and density  functional techniques, to join Dr. Nakanishi  and his group of
              researchers in Japan. The  team at Kyoto has conducted extensive work on 
              computer modeling using Monte Carlo  calculations concerned with fluid phase 
              equilibrium. The project brings together the  complementary research interests
              of the  investigators.    The award is funded under the auspices of the  Center
              for Global Partnership (CGP) of the  Japan Foundation under the NSF-CGP 
              Science Fellowship Program.  ***
