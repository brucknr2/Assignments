Abstract    :
               The focus of this project is the development of compilers and  interpreters for
              Logic and Constraint Programming (CLP) languages  executing on  sequential and
              parallel machines. Prolog is an  example of such a language, and  it offers the
              users capabilities  of solving problems in domains including  reals, booleans
              and  strings. The four specific topics of the project are:    (1) Constraint
              Parallelism.  Constraint solvers for several domains  (including integers,
              reals and booleans) are designed,  implemented and  analyzed on parallel
              machines. These solvers are used to prototype  constraint parallel Prolog
              systems; (2) Program Analysis and Transformations.    Tools for the analysis of
               parallel constraint and logic programs are  developed. Some of  the techniques
              that are considered are partial  evaluation and  abstract interpretation based
              global analysis; (3) Extension of  CLP.  High-level, C-like languages based on 
              constraints and interval arithmetic  are designed, implemented  and analyzed.
              The possibility of integrating,  functional, set-theoretic and CLP languages in
              a single higher order logic  programming framework is also studied; and (4)
              Applications of Parallel CLP.  Several classes of parallel CLP  applications
              are considered, including  genome parsing,  combinatorial search problems (such
              as scheduling), and  optimization of non-linear constraint systems.
