Abstract    :
              9403085  Goroff  Dr. Nancy S. Goroff has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral 
              Research Fellowship in Chemistry.  Dr. Goroff received her  doctoral degree
              from the University of California at Los  Angeles under the supervision of
              Professor Francois Diederich.  Dr. Goroff will continue research at Michigan
              State University  under the sponsorship of Professor James Jackson. Her 
              postdoctoral research will focus on the structure and  reactivity of
              bis-alkynylcarbenes and other neutral  odd-numbered pi-systems. Longer term,
              she plans to develop a  research program probing the structure and reactivity
              of other  neutral all-carbon molecules by photoelectron spectroscopy and 
              matrix isolation.    The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program
              is  viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to  broaden the
              knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract  them into meaningful
              careers in contemporary chemical research  and teaching.
