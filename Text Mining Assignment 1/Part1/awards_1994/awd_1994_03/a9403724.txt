Abstract    :
              9403724  Weiss      The research covers several topics in smooth dynamical 
              systems including hyperbolic sets in dynamical systems,  relationships with
              thermodynamics, stochastic behavior of flows  and related spectral theory. The
              research has potential  applications to other areas of dynamical systems, chaos
              and areas  of mathematical physics involving ergodicity and entropy.   ***
