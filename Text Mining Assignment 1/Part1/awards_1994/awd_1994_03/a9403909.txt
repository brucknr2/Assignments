Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  Raymond Gorte  CTS-9403909    This is a study of acidity and
              acid-catalyzed chemistry in zeolites and other solid acids.  The objectives is
              a predictive capability for reaction rates and selectivities.  The principal
              approaches used include carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of
              carbonyl-containing molecules in zeolites to characterize site strengths, site
              dynamics, and site locations; microcalorimetry on zeolites with a range of
              potential reactants and products, with the results correlated to a
              proton-affinity model of the acid sites; and second-harmonic-generation (SHG)
              measurements of adsorbates in large single crystals to determine locations of
              sites in ZSM-5.  The NMR work is complemented with theoretical calculations of
              the chemical-shift anisotropy of carbonyl-containing molecules in an acidic
              environment.  The techniques for acid site characterization are tested with
              complex solid acids such as sulfonated zirconia.  This is an
              industry-university cooperative research project between the University of
              Pennsylvania and the DuPont Company.    The replacement of  solution-phase
              acids with heterogeneous, solid acids in the production of chemicals offers
              major downstream savings to the chemical, textile, and pharmaceutical
              industries.  Besides their economic benefits, solid acids are usually much less
              of an occupational safety problem than liquid acids.  This study provides a
              conceptual/intellectual framework for selecting acids and incorporating them
              into process design.  ***
