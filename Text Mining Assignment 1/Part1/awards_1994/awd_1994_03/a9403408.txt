Abstract    :
              9303408  Von Damm       In this multi-institutional project the PIs will analyze
               chimney samples and water samples from Lucky Strike, a newly  discovered vent
              site along MAR.  This site is somewhat unique  relative to previously
              discovered hydrothermal vent systems in  that it is located on the Azores
              platform and that the vents are  more dispersed.  There are other similarities
              and differences.  The PIs argue that the samples to be analyzed represent an 
              opportunity to study a shallow hydrothermal system on a slow-  spreading ridge.
