Abstract    :
              9403703   Weyman                The aim of this research is to study the
              varieties arising  as the collapsing of vector bundles. Several parts of the 
              research correspond to the most interesting examples of such  varieties.  The
              first part is to study degrees, determinantal  expressions and singularities of
              generalized discriminants and  resultants.  Special attention will be paid to
              the classical  discriminants and resultants as well as the hyperdeterminants- 
              the discriminants of multidimensional matrices.  The second part  is concerned
              with singularities of conjugacy classes of nilpotent  elements in classical Lie
              algebras.  The main goal here is to  prove the principal investigator's
              conjecture on non-normal  orbits.  The third part is to sutdy the varieties of
              binary forms  with multiple roots.                This research is concerned
              with a number of questions in  commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. 
              Algebraic geometry  studies solutions of families of polynomial equations.  One
              can  either study the geometry of the solution set or approach  problems
              algebraically by investigating certain functions on the  solution set that form
              what is called a commutative ring.  This  dual perspective creates a close
              connection between commutative  algebra and algebraic geometry.
