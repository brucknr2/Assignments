Abstract    :
              9417199  Yen    This award supports the participation of eleven U.S. scientists
              in a  U.S.-Japan seminar on Highly Confined and Extremely Diluted  Condensed
              Matter Systems, to be held at Kanagawa, Japan from  September 18-22, 1995.  The
              co-organizers ape Dr. William Yen of  the University of Georgia and Professor
              Eiichi Hanamura of the  University of Tokyo. This seminar is focus on the
              theory,  characterization, spectroscopy of highly confined and extremely 
              diluted condensed matter systems.  Topics to be covered include  ultrasensitive
              spectroscopies, single molecule/center spectroscopy,  low dimensional systems
              and nanostructures, and near field  microscopies.    The seminar will foster
              the type of contact between Japanese and  U.S. scientists that can be expected
              to have significant influence on  the future course of the field.  The proposed
              participants and  observers have been selected for their past contributions and
               current activity in the field and the meeting can be expected to  produce
              concrete plans for future cooperation and exchange.   Therefore, this proposal
              fulfills the objectives of the Program in its  exchange and transfer of
              scientific knowledge through an  international collaboration.  ***
