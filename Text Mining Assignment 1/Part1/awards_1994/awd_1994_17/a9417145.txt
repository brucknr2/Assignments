Abstract    :
              9417145  Moody    The goal of this research is an understanding of the role of 
              meteorological influences on the physical, chemical and radiative  properties
              of aerosols in the atmosphere.  This is a collaborative  effort involving a
              team of atmospheric chemists and meteorologists  who will study the behavior of
              aerosols in the North Atlantic Ocean  atmosphere using surface-based and remote
              sensing techniques.  This  work entails analyses to quantify the continuous and
              dynamic  influence of transport and removal processes.  We will prepare 
              isentropic trajectory analyses and will be prepared and combined  with the
              chemical and physical observations using cluster analysis  and other
              statistical techniques.  This is part of an effort to  relate the observed
              chemical and physical characteristics to  specific sources and source types. 
              Remotely-sensed rainfall and  aerosol optical depth estimates prepared
              operationally will be used  to understand the sources and variability of
              aerosols in the North  Atlantic area.
