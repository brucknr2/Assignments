Abstract    :
              9417906  Nyblade   This award provides partial (67%) funding for an upgrade to
              the computer facility for geophysics in the Department of Geosciences at the
              Pennsylvania State University. The institution is committed to providing the
              remaining funds necessary for the acquisition of this equipment. The geophysics
              computing facility is the principal research facility for four faculty members
              and their students who have active research and teaching programs in the areas
              of seismology, earthquake seismology, tectonics, heat flow, gravity and
              geomagnetism. The upgraded facility, comprising a new central server with large
              memory and several new workstations, replaces an existing facility which does
              not meet the current research and teaching needs of the geophysics group at
              Penn State.  ***
