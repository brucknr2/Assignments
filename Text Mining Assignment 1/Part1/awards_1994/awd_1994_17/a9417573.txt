Abstract    :
              9417573  Ramirez  The primary objectives of this research starter grant are to
              clone and characterize the genes  REC1 and REC3 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae
              that are thought function in the overlapping   processes of mitotic
              recombination and DNA repair. rec1- and rec3- strains have been shown   to be
              defective in mitotic recombination and possess temperature sensitive phenotypes
                  rec 1- is a ts-lethal at 39{SYMBOL 176 \f "Symbol"}, while both rec1- and
              rec3- are ts with respect to mitotic   recombination, X-ray sensitivity and
              sporulation at 36{SYMBOL 176 \f "Symbol"}. Additionally, both these mutations  
              define distinct genes which map to chromosome 11. A yeast genomic library will
              be used   to transform rec1- and rec3- strains of S. cerevisiae in order to
              clone the corresponding   wild-type genes by complementation. Previous studies
              aimed at cloning the REC3 gene   resulted in the isolation of a suppressor of
              rec3-, RPD3. (RPD3 is thought to encode   pleiotropic transcriptional regulator
              encoded on chromosome XIV). Hence, we will focus   our efforts on
              characterizing clones which complement the rec1- and rec3- mutations and  
              which specifically hybridize to chromosome Vll DNA on a Southern blot of
              electrophoretically   separated whole chromosomes. To accelarate cloning of
              REC3, we will also test a genetic  clone that maps closely to the REC3 locus
              (i.e., a clone containing genetic material   adjacent to the AR02 gene) to
              determine if it contains sequences which complement the   rec3- defect. Once
              cloned, the REC1 and REC3 clones will be sequenced. The resulting   genetic
              sequence will be compared to other sequences genetic sequence data bases to  
              gain insight into the function of the proteins encoded by these genes. Cloned
              REC1 and   REC3 DNA will also be used to create null mutations to provide
              definitive mapping   information, to determine lethality, and to assay gene
              expression by Northern   hybridization. Since we have found that RPD3
              suppresses the rec3- defect, an additional   objecti ve of this proposal is to
              determine the possible role played by RPD3 in recombination.  This will be
              tested by testing the sensitivity of rpd- strains to ionizing radiation, methyl
              methane sulfonate (MMS), and measuring rates of recombination.    %%%  The
              information generated frorm, this basic research project will contribute to our
              knowledge   of the regulation and/or enzymology of recombination and DNA repair
              in eukaryotes.  ***
