Abstract    :
              Self-assembled organic thiol monolayers on gold electrodes can be used to probe
              the details of  electron transfer from the electrode to redox couples in
              solution.  In this research project,  supported by the Analytical and Surface
              Chemistry Program, insulated electrode voltammetry  will be developed by
              Professor Cary Miller and his students at the University of Maryland as  a
              method to probe electron transfer processes, taking advantage of the structure
              of these self-  assembled organic monolayers.  Electron coupling within the
              thiol monolayers will be  investigated by functional group replacement within
              the molecular overlayer.  The work  combines the synthesis of specific
              molecules to test ideas of electron transfer in these layers, as  well as the
              detailed electrochemical measurements needed to understand the kinetics of
              electron  transfer across these layers.  This information could have long range
              use in the design and  control of molecular electronic devices.     In order to
              rationally design ultra small scale electronic devices using molecular
              components,  a detailed understanding of electron transfer across molecular
              species must be developed.  This  research project begins to develop this sort
              of understanding by making detailed measurements  of electron transfer
              processes across model organic thin films, whose structure and functional 
              group make-up can be readily varied.
