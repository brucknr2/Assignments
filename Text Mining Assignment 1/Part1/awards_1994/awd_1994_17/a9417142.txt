Abstract    :
              9417142  Sauer       This block travel grant will support the attendance of U.S.
               academic researchers at the third Bulk Power System Voltage  Phenomena Seminar
              to be held in Davos, Switzerland on August 22-  26, l994.  This seminar will be
              addressing the critical issues of  voltage phenomena in large interconnected
              systems.  These  phenomena are emerging as one of the most important problems 
              associated with the maintenance of reliable electric service in  the U.S. The
              objectives of this grant are to allow a significant  number of U.S. academic
              researchers to actively participate in  this major international event.  The
              first two seminars on this  topic have produced the leading literature and
              primary references  for voltage collapse problems.  The first two seminars were
               scheduled in the U.S. in September 1988 (Potosi, Missouri) and  August 1991
              (Deep Creek Lake, Maryland).  In an effort to promote  more international
              exchange of ideas, this seminar has been  scheduled in Europe.  It is essential
              for the U.S. researchers to  continue their active involvement in this critical
              area of power  system analysis.  ***
