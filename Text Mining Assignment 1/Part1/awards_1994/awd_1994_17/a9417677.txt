Abstract    :
              9417677  Pasteris   This award provides partial funding for the support of a
              technician in charge of operations and maintenance of the laser Raman
              microprobe laboratories in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at
              Washington University, St. Louis. Raman microprobe spectroscopy is a
              non-destructive technique in which a laser beam is introduced into a sample via
              a microscope. Solid, liquid, and gaseous phases can be identified rapidly and
              structurally characterized. The Principal Investigator and her colleagues at
              Washington University use Raman spectroscopy in a variety of research projects
              aimed at understanding the role of elements such as carbon, oxygen, hydrogen,
              and nitrogen in the formation of metamorphic and volcanic rocks.  ***
