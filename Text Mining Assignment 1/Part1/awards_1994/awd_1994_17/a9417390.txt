Abstract    :
              9417390  Wetherbee   This project proposes to significantly increase the number
              of American Indian students attaining four year and graduate degrees in
              computer science and engineering, FDLTCC and Fond du Lac Ojibwe School (a
              tribal K-12 institution) will hold summer camps for American Indian youth in
              grade 5-8, and bridge-to- college camps for grades 9-12, to study interesting,
              engaging computer science activities and applications.  They shall also study
              traditional Native American view of the world - not to abandon standard Western
              scientific methods, but to examine fresh approaches to problem solving.  FDLTCC
              will create a lower division computer science program designed specifically to
              support and encourage American Indian students through successful transfer to a
              four year institution to complete their upper division CISE studies.  Formal
              mentoring and curriculum designed to encourage performance in a cooperative
              manner will characterize the tribal college program.    This model, cultivating
              interest in CISE work among American Indian youth, supporting the bridge from
              K-12 schools to the tribal college, strongly supporting American Indian
              students in lower division CISE studies, and supporting students through
              transfer to high quality four year computer science programs, is designed to be
              attractive and applicable to tribal K-12 schools and colleges governed by
              sovereign tribal nations which are the key education providers for American
              Indian youth living on or near tribal lands.  ***
