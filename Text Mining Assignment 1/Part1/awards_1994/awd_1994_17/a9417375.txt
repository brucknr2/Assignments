Abstract    :
                  9417375  Berger      This award will partially support the travel expenses
              for   Dr. Ralph Berger of the Department of Biology, University  of California,
              Santa Cruz, to enable him to travel to  Tasmania, Australia to conduct
              cooperative research with   Dr. Stewart Nicol of the Department of Physiology
              at the  University of Tasmania in Hobart, Australia.  The cooperative  work
              will focus on a study of sleep in the echidna   (Tachyglossus aculeatus), a
              primitive egg-laying mammal  unique to Australia.    Current evolutionary
              theory of sleep maintains that slow  wave sleep evolved in conjunction with
              endothermy (metabolic  heat production), while rapid eye movement sleep (REM)
              emerged  later in early ancestors of marsupial and placental mammals.  This
              project will examine sleep in young echidnas at an  ambient temperature and in
              a light/dark cycle similar to their  natural habitat.  Dr. Nicol has performed
              comparative   thermoregulatory and metabolic studies on echidnas for  several
              years; Dr. Berger contributes expertise in the  comparative electrophysiology
              of sleep.  In addition to the  evolutionary significance of this project,
              information   from the study may aid in the conservation and management of  
              echidnas and other primitive mammals.
