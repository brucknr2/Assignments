Abstract    :
              9417144  Boudreau   This research involves a study of compaction in igneous
              cumulates utilizing a quantitative approach.  the proposed study would include
              development of numerical models of compaction that can be used to determine the
              importance of several parameters including:  variation in cumulate density with
              height, the rate of heat loss and generation within the cumulus pile, and the
              rate of accumulation of crystals.  The theoretical model will aid in
              understanding correlations between lamination, bulk major and trace element
              composition, mineral compositions, and the liquid-fluid compositions as
              indicated by accessory phases.  Initial models will be designed to be broadly
              applicable to all types of rocks formed by accumulation of crystals.
