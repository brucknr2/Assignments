Abstract    :
              Abstract   Presbyterian Healthcare Services - R. Vaughn   Connection to NSFNET 
              Proposal No. NCR-9417126  Presbyterian Healthcare Services network project will
              integrate  the existing state-wide network at PHS with the NSFNET.  This 
              integration will provide access to national databases from PHS  staff and
              physicians in addition to fostering peer communication  and data exchange with
              external sources.    Immediate beneficiaries will be the PHS Medical Library,
              the PHS  Quality Support Services Department and the physicians affiliated 
              with PHS.  Uses include access to bibliographic databases, on-  line library
              catalogs, electronic mail, and large volume data  exchanges with external
              sources.  The specialized bibliographic  databases from the National Library of
              Medicine, such as Medline  and Cancerline, are also available through NSFNET.
