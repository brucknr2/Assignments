Abstract    :
              9417951  Duncan  This project is to participate in an international 
              collaborative investigation of the East Greenland portion of  the North
              Atlantic Tertiary Basalt Province.  In this  project particular emphasis will
              be placed on the flow-by-  flow stratigraphy of basalt flows using field
              mapping,  compositional and paleomagnetic methods, and radiometric  ages. 
              These data will be used to constrain both the  physical nature and the duration
              of this exceptionally large  volcanic event, to correlate discontinuous
              sections of East  Greenland basalts, and to relate the flow sequences to 
              coastal dike swarms.  Overall coordination and logistics for  field work are
              being supplied by the Danish Lithosphere  Center.  We will participate in field
              mapping and sample  collection, and will contribute radiometric age 
              determinations by the 40Ar-39Ar incremental heating method,  to define the
              timing and duration of volcanism, and in  support of constructing a composite
              volcanic stratigraphy.  The timing and duration of volcanism in this province
              will  be used to assess "active" (plume heads) vs "passive" (plume  incubation)
              models of continental rifting in the presence of  a mantle plume.
