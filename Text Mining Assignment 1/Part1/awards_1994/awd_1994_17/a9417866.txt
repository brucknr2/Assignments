Abstract    :
                9417866  The objectives of the proposed research are to probe the energies 
              and lifetimes of the adsorbate and substrate excited states and  to understand
              the connection between the excited state relaxation  processes and the observed
              photochemical products.  Two-photon  photoemission in the pump-probe
              configuration with a tunable  laser will be used to measure the energies and
              lifetimes of the  excited states.  A mass spectrometer and a high-resolution 
              electron energy loss spectrometer provide chemical information on  the
              photochemical products.  The uniquely low work function of  Lanthanum
              hexaboride(100) serves as a model metal substrate on  which molecules with
              different electron affinities are adsorbed.   The effects of a band gap on the
              relaxation processes will be  investigated on clean and K-preadsorbed gallium
              nitride thin films.   Studies on the photochemistry of oxygen coadsorbed with
              carbon  monoxide on platinum and the photodesorption of carbon monoxide  from
              silicon will be pursued.  %%%%  Surface photochemistry is intimately connected
              to the relaxation  of excited states at the surface.  Information on the
              excited  states at surfaces is very scarce, despite their importance in 
              surface photochemistry.  The subsequent microscopic steps  following absorption
              of photons are largely unknown and at best  conjectured from the distribution
              of end products.  It has been  firmly established that the two most important
              and widespread  mechanisms of surface photochemistry are:  1. direct electronic
               excitation of the adsorbed molecules, and 2. substrate excitation  followed by
              interactions of photogenerated hot carriers with the  adsorbed molecules.  The
              objectives of the proposed research are  to probe the energies and lifetimes of
              the adsorbate and  substrate excited states and to understand the connection
              between  the excited state relaxation processes and the observed  photochemical
              products.
