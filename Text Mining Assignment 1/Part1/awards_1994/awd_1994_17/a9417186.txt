Abstract    :
              Cassineli  9417186    Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars have winds with very large mass-loss
              rates and fast terminal speeds. The  resultant wind momentum flux greatly
              exceeds that in the emergent radiation field.  In contrast  with the winds of O
              stars, the WR winds appear to accelerate rather slowly so that moderate 
              stellar rotation can lead to a significant enhancement of the density in the
              equatorial region of  the stars.  This research is to develop two-dimensional
              models of the winds and to investigate  the consequences of the structure for
              the observations of WR stars using the "Wind Compression  Zone" model.  It is
              based on the "Wind Compression Disk" model, which was developed for  rapidly
              rotating Be stars.  For stars rotating at about 10% to 20% critical, the wind
              compression  may explain a number of puzzling observational properties of WR
              stars, such as why only some  WR stars show polarization and why WR stars with 
              compact companions can have strong X-ray emission.    In addition, we will
              study the Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs) using our 2-D WCZ model.   These
              objects are thought to be a precursor stage to the WR phase.  LBVs are observed
              to have  slow winds, and some appear to have axisymmetric structure (e.g. AG
              Carinae), which  indicates that these stars are also good candidates for the
              application of our rotating wind model.   There is also evidence of non-thermal
              radio emission from WR stars and that the winds might  be source of high energy
              particle production.  Because of these observations magnetic fields will  also
              be included in the WCZ picture.  This will allow us to re-interpret the
              observational  evidence, and also allow us to investigate the consequences of
              the fields on the wind dynamics.  ***
