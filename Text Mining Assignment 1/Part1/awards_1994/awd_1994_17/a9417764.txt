Abstract    :
              9417764  Carlson  This project will apply the novel technology of high- 
              resolution computed X-ray tomography to the quantitative  analysis of
              metamorphic textures, with the aim of  identifying mechanisms of metamorphic
              reactions and  quantifying their rates.  High resolution and ultra-high- 
              resolution X-ray tomographic imagery of porphyroblastic and 
              non-porphyroblastic rocks will be digitally processedp and  analyzed to gather
              comprehensive data on the spatial  disposition and size distribution of
              crystals.  Successful  completion of this project will permit calculation of
              actual  rates of fundamental metamorphic processes including rates  of crystal
              growth.  Knowledge of crystal growth rates will  ultimately lead to a more
              precise quantification of P-T-time  paths, better constrained rates of
              tectonometamorphic  processes, and estimates from textural data of rates of 
              heating and influx of chemically reactive fluids in  appropriate metamorphic
              rocks.
