Abstract    :
              9417323  Turro  The focus of the workshop will be to bring together students 
              and faculty to create hypermedia modules for general, organic,  physical and
              computational chemistry courses.  The participants  will come from Cloumbia and
              from an external consortium.  The  modules will will be tested at Columbia,
              throughout the  consortium and in at least one high school, the Dalton School 
              of New York City.  %%%  With this award the Chemistry Division is supporting a
              workshop  organized by Dr. Nicholas J. Turro of the Department of  Chemistry at
              Columbia University.  The workshop will enable  faculty and undergraduates to
              work together to create  hypermedia modules to stimulate systemic changes in
              the  undergraduate curriculum in chemistry.
