Abstract    :
              9417944  Allmendinger         This is a proposal for the first phase of a two
              phase project  which will culminate in the collection of a deep seismic
              reflection  profile across the Central Andes.  The goals of Phase 1 are:  1) 
              Organize a Workshop on opportunities for deep seismic reflection  profiling in
              the Central Andes.  The purpose of the workshop will  be to identify and
              prioritize possible reflection transects across  the Central Andes and to
              organize the multi-institutional  scientific team which will be responsible for
              Phase 2;  2) Inspect  and reprocess selected industry reflection data,
              including extended  correlation of VIBROSEIS data, to evaluate the reflection
              data  quality potential along the high priority routes in the field area;  3)
              Scouting of routes and logistics along the high priority  transects.  Phase 1
              will provide the necessary groundwork for Phase  2, the acquisition of new deep
              seismic data.  ***
