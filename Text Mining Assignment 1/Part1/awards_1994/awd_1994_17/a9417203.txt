Abstract    :
              Abstract  Toledo Hospital - Lewis  Proposal No. 9417203  The Ruralnet and
              Internet Connection Project will provide a  multicampus Internet connection
              between the Toledo Hospital and  fourteen community hospitals located in the
              region.  The project  will link the Toledo Hospital (TTH) to internet via a
              direst leased  line connection with OARnet, an Ohio based mid-level network
              with  10 current local network sites and 270 institutional users  throughout
              Ohio.    Currently, TTH has a National Library of Medicine funded project- 
              Ruralnet - which links eight rural hospitals to TTH for access to  MEDLINE and
              other databases using Grateful Med.  The TTH collection  support to the
              consortium hospitals. The proposed project will  upgrade the linkage at these
              hospitals to include connectivity to  the Internet.
