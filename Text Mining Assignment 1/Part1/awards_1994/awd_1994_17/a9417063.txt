              Abstract  ATM-9417063  Nichloson, Sharon E.  Florida State University  Title:
              Hydrology and Regional Climatology of the East African              Lakes:
              Applications for Paleoclimate Studies    This award supports a study of the
              climate history in the area of  the East African Lakes.  The primary goal is to
              quantify the  hydrological balances of the East African lakes in order to 
              facilitate interpretation of their long-term histories in terms of  regional
              and global climate.  The second goal is the production of  a regional data base
              of climatic and hydrologic information  relevant to the project.  The work will
              involve five main tasks:         1. Archiving relevant climatic and hydrologic
              information for       each lake; 2. Assessment of means and temporal variations
              of       key climatic elements; 3. Reconstruction of historical      
              fluctuations of East African lake and catchments; 4.       Derivation of a
              water and energy balances model for lakes and       catchments;  5. Application
              of models to historical lake       levels of Lake Victoria.    One major result
              of the project will be a record and analysis of  climate and lake levels in
              East Africa during the past two to three  centuries.  It will help to determine
              the nature and degree of  response of the lakes to global and regional climate,
              including lag  relationships between climate and lake-level fluctuations.  The 
              study will help to uncover the relationships between climate of  this region
              and climate variability in other areas of the tropics  and in the higher
              latitudes.  The results will also provide a  framework for the interpretation
              of long-term ecological changes in  the lakes.
