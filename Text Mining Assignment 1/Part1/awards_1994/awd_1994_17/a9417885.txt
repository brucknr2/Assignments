Abstract    :
              9417885  Schuh  A detailed understanding of the dynamic internal motion of
              globular  proteins is sought because of its importance to a knowledge of the 
              structure/function relationships of proteins as they pertain to  fundamental
              research and to applied aspects of industrial research  involving production of
              protein pharmaceuticals and the logical  design of drugs.  The principal
              investigator and students have  reported that the phosphorescence of
              6-bromo-2-naphthyl sulfate  (BNS) is quenched specifically by the heme of heme
              proteins.  The  rate constant for quenching, kq, is determined from lifetime 
              measurements of laser-induced phosphorescence and is used to judge  the extent
              to which internal motion of heme proteins makes the heme  rings accessible.  In
              this research attempts will be made to  substitute larger phosphorescent
              molecular probes (e.g. 9-bromo-6-  phenanthrene sulfate) in place of BNS.  Also
              kq will be measured  for several enzymatic and non-enzymatic heme proteins as a
              function  of temperature and solvent conditions.  %%%  The ultimate goals are
              to: 1) estimate the size of transient  fluctuations in proteins, 2) determine
              whether there are  fundamental differences in the dynamics of enzymatic and
              non-  enzymatic heme proteins, 3) compare the dynamics of native proteins  and
              an important intermediate in protein folding, called the molten  globule, 4)
              gain insight into the accessibility of the hemes in  heme protein complexes,
              and 5) determine whether tertiary  structural dynamics of hemoglobin is
              important to the binding and  release of molecular oxygen.  ***
