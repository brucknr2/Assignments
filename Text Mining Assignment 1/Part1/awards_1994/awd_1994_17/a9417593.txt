Abstract    :
                9417593  Nolin       The primary objective of this proposed research is to
              examine  and evaluate how the spatial and temporal variability of snow  albedo
              affects the timing and intensity of seasonal snow melt and  other hydrologic
              variables including soil moisture, potential  evapotranspiration and
              atmospheric circulation patterns.  Seasonal  snow accumulation and ablation in
              both the mid-latitudes and the  polar regions will be modeled using a general
              circulation model  (GCM) with which spatially and temporally varying snow
              albedo will  be employed.  Current means of snow albedo parameterization in 
              GCM's are based on temperature, latitude, and snow depth rather  than the
              physical properties of snow.  Validation of the GCM-  derived extent of
              snowcover and snow water equivalent will be  performed.  Physically-based
              parameterizations of snow albedo will  be developed for use in mathematical
              models of climate.  The  viability of using particular GCM's for large-scale
              snow hydrologic  estimates will be determined.  The feasibility of using
              physically-  based, time- and space-variant snow albedos in a GCM will also be 
              evaluated.  Remote sensing data will be investigated as a means of  assessing
              the accuracy of GCM snowcover estimates.  Current models  of climate are
              sensitive to snow albedo, yet they use simple,  inaccurate parameterization. 
              What is needed is a comprehensive  study of the relationship between snow
              albedo and hydrologic  response of climate models to sptial and temporal
              changes in snow  albedo.  GMC accuracy for seasonal snow extent and depth is
              still  untested.
