Abstract    :
              Connecticut Hospital Research and Education Foundation, Inc. - J.  Lynch  
              Connection to NSFNET  Proposal No. NCR-9417578  The Connecticut Hospital
              Research and Education Foundation, Inc.  (CHREF), a non-profit affiliate of the
              Connecticut Hospital  Association, proposes to serve as a central coordination
              site to  interconnect interested health care institutions and to provide  such
              institutions with a gateway to the NSFNET.  This connection  will benefit both
              health care professionals and patients, and  will provide an infrastructure
              which will be used for a multitude  of health care related applications and
              communications.    CHREF proposes to accomplish this connectivity using a frame
               relay based network approach in order to provide sufficient  bandwidth upgrade
              potential.  This will provide  a cost effective  solution, and will also serve
              to isolate intra-state network  traffic from the internet.
