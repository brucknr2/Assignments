Abstract    :
              9417594  Kent     High quality Carnian-Norian magnetostratigraphies derived
              recently from two marine sections in Turkey and a thick continental
              (lacustrine) section in the Newark Rift Basin are not easily correlated.  The
              correlation even between the two Turkish sections is problematic, and is
              facilitated by supposing that the two condensed sections were in opposite
              hemispheres in Late Triassic time.  A 200m thick Carnian-Norian (Upper
              Triassic) section at Silica Brezova (Slovakia) provides the opportunity to
              resolve the uncertainties in Carnian-Norian magnetostratigraphic correlations. 
              The Silica Brezova section contains all Late Carnian and Norian conodont zones
              in an exceptionally thick (uncondensed) section of "Hallstatt Limestone"
              facies.  The conodont alteration indices are close to 1, indicating no
              appreciable burial of the thrust unit which contains the section.  A pilot
              magnetostratigraphic study on a 35m interval from the middle (Lacian) part of
              the Silica Brezova section has yielded a clear polarity zonation and a positive
              fold test.  Magnetostratigraphy and biostratigraphy of the 200m Silica Brezova
              section should provide a first correlation of the high resolution
              cyclostratigraphy from the Neward Basin to the marine realm which is essential
              to the development of an integrated Late Triassic timescale linking marine and
              non-marine stratigraphies.
