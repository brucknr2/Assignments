Abstract    :
              9417190  Font  The Inter American University of Puerto Rico requests support
              from  NSF for connection of five remote campus networks within Puerto  Rico. 
              Those five campuses include:  Aguadialla Campus,  Barranquitas Campus, Fajardo
              Campus, Guayama Campus and Law School.    With strong support from the
              individual site administrations,  capable network infrastructures, coordination
              provided by the Inter  American University and support from the National
              Science  Foundation the students, faculty and staff at the individual  campuses
              should be able to take advantage of the Internet to  advance their professional
              development and academic needs.  The  grant funds will be used to provide each
              campus with communications  hardware and 128KB lines for a two year period.   
              The Colleges needs the Internet connection to be able to access  information
              resources throughout the state, the nation and the  world.
