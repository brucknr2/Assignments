Abstract    :
              In this research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
              Program, Professor  Arthur Hubbard and his students at the University of
              Cincinnati will measure the detailed  angular distributions of emitted Auger
              electrons for a variety of well characterized surfaces with  atomic and
              molecular overlayers.  These angular distributions will be carefully compared
              with  the distributions predicted based on competing models of the electron
              emission process, in order  to develop a method for extracting surface
              structural information from the angular distributions.   Surface structural
              information for overlayers on electrode surfaces will enable a detailed 
              understanding of the electrochemistry occurring at these interdaces.    
              Electrochemistry is important in an enormous number of technological
              applications, ranging  from sensors to batteries.  In order to understand the
              chemistry which occurs at the electrode  surface in these wide ranging
              electrochemical applications, one must know the structure of the  electrode and
              any atomic or molecular overlayers associated with it.  This research project
              is  designed to develop a method for structural analysis of these overlayers
              based on the  measurement of the angular distribution of electrons emitted from
              these surfaces.
