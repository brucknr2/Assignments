Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    REIMER, Robert  9417692    The CORF plays an essential role in
              defending the spectrum related interests of the U.S. scientific community
              before national and international organizations that deal with the allocation
              and efficient use of the radio spectrum.  During the last year the CORF filed
              comments before the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), on matters related
              to the upcoming World Radio Conference (WRC-95), Mobile Satellite Proceedings,
              and Use of Frequencies Above 60 GHz. The Committee has made presentations to
              the FCC staff on radio astronomers' use of the spectrum, and related
              interference issues.      These activities will continue next year.  The next
              WARC (WRC-95) will be held in October-November of 1995, and the CORF will have
              to represent the point of view of the scientific community in various national
              and international fora dealing with preparations for the onference.  Moreover,
              since WRCs are now held on a regular, two yearly basis, preparations will have
              to begin for the 1997 Conference, which will deal with space related issues,
              among others.     The CORF, through it's liaison member, also participates in
              the work of the Radiocommunication Sector (formerly CCIR), particularly in the
              work of Study Group 7 (Science Services) and Task Group 1/3, dealing with
              spurious emissions. Recommendations issued  by the Radiocommunication Sector
              provide the technical underpinnings for the protection of radio astronomy from
              interference from active radio services.       ***
