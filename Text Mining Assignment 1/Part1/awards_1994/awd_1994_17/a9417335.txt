Abstract    :
              9417335  Lapczynski   The College of Misericordia requests support from NSF for 
              connection of its campus network to PACnet.  PACnet is a  new  internetwork
              service provider located in the state of  Pennsylvania.  It will provide
              operations management and  information services and it will give the College of
              Misericordia  a connection to the NSFNET, comprising midlevel networks, Network
               Service Providers, and a Routing Authority which is supported by  the National
              Science Foundation.    The college needs greater functionality and network
              speed to be  able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers 
              along with being able to implement a more reliable mail system.   Students and
              faculty research will benefit from the link.  This  is also a unique
              opportunity for the school to explore innovative  educational resources.
