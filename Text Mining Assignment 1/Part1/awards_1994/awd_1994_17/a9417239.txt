Abstract    :
              9417239  Ivory  This project is on research to study separation of 
              polyelectrolytes by coupling electrophoresis and ultrafiltration.   The basic
              idea is that competition between electrophoretic  transport, caused by an
              electric field, and convective transport  across a porous barrier (a membrane),
              caused by pressure flow and  electroosmosis of solvent, can be used to separate
              charged  macromolecules such as proteins on the basis of their  electrophoric
              mobility.  Preliminary work has been done with one  solute and one porous
              barrier.  The proposed research would  investigate and  develop a system with
              multibarriers and  multicomponent solutions, with the objective of
              fractionating a  mixture of proteins into different compartments bounded by two
               porous barriers.  In addition to this apparatus, the research  will develop a
              model of the electrokinetic phenomena inside and  outside of the membrane
              pores.  ***
