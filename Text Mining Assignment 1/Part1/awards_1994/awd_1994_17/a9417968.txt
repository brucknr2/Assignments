                                          ABSTRACT                                    AST
              94-17968  Turner, Jean              Interstellar  gas  provides the  fuel  for 
              star  formation,  luminous star bursts, and active galactic nuclei, phenomena
              which  are  most apparent in galactic nuclei. Radio and millimeter  wave 
              emission  line observations permit study of the distribution  and  dynamics  of
               gas  in  galaxies.  For  this  project,  millimeter  interferometric
              observations will be made of carbon monoxide (CO)  in  nearby galaxies. High
              resolution measurements near a galactic  nucleus  allow  mapping  the 
              molecular  gas  at  close  to   the  resolution  of  individual molecular
              clouds (> 20 parsecs).  From  such  mapped images, one can determine the mass
              of molecular gas,  the orbits of molecular clouds, and from the orbits, how
              mass  is  distributed in the central regions. Previous work has shown,  for 
              example, that for many galaxies mapped in CO, more than  half  of  the  total
              mass within the inner few hundred parsecs is molecular  gas.  With
              multi-transition CO observations, one can infer  cloud  properties  such as
              temperature and density and study  how  these  properties vary with location in
              the galaxy. Finally, mapping the  large-scale structure of the galactic disk in
              both CO and in  the  atomic  hydrogen 21 cm line permits examination  of  the 
              linkage  between nuclear gas and disk gas.
