Abstract    :
              9417006  Murphy  This  project  is  on  research to  characterize  and  model 
              the response of tumor cells to targeted toxins, and to  develop design
              strategies  for improving the efficacy of  targeted toxins.   This research has
              two objectives: (1) the  cellular processing kinetics of  several  combinations
              of  target, targeting  agent,  and  cell lines  are  to be  experimentally
              determined and used  to  develop mathematical  models, which are to relate
              cellular trafficking of  the  target  agent to protein synthesis inhibition,
              and  describe  the  time  these  molecules spend inside the cell;  and  (2) 
              the feasibility  will  be  explored  of  improving  the  efficacy of  targeted
              toxins by chemical modifications of  the targeting  agent in order to increase
              the time the  targeting agent is to reside in the  Golgi apparatus.  This 
              research could contribute to rational drug design while  generating new
              knowledge on immunotoxins.  ***
