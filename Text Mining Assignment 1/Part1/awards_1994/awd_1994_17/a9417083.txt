Abstract    :
              Wheeler, J. Craig  AST 94-17083  This program of research is directed at
              understanding the non-linear effects of tidal interaction of stars.  Mixing of
              stellar interiors and non-linear excitation of various modes of stellar
              oscillations and surface waves will be studied using a three-dimensional, high
              resolution, finite-difference numerical technique.  Excitation, stripping and
              disruption of stars passing by massive Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes will
              be simulated, taking into account relativistic effects, realistic equation of
              state and nuclear reactions.  Disruption limits for various kinds of stars will
              be obtained, including multiple encounters of captured stars with the black
              hole and the disruption of white dwarfs and neutron stars on circular orbits. 
              Implications for fueling of massive black holes, supernova scale explosions
              triggered by tidal interaction, and gravitation wave radiation will be
              considered.  ***
