Abstract    :
              Abstract   Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital - Gilda Lugo   Connection to NSFNET 
              Proposal No. NCR-9417153  This proposal for connecting the Santa Barbara
              Cottage Hospital  to the Internet will be introducing Internet as a new
              information  service and a major tool for enhancing communication.  It will be 
              used to strengthen clinical programs and expand the hospital's  effectiveness
              as a Healthcare Center.    A few of the programs strengthened by the Internet
              connection  include: physicians will be able to log information into clinical 
              trials and share more effectively in national trials; surgeons  will have
              access to trauma registries, medical images and  worldwide consultation;
              administrators and residents in the  independent residency programs will have
              access to the AAMC  electronic residency application service; and the medical
              library  will use Internet for enhancing reference and document delivery 
              services and strengthening outreach.    Access to the Internet will strengthen
              the ability of Santa  Barbara Cottage Hospital to function as a regional
              referral  center and to advance its role in education, research and the 
              promotion of health.
