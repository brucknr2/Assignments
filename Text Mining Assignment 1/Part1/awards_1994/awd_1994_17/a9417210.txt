Abstract    :
              9417210  Wilking    The study of the mass function of a young, embedded cluster
              of stars in  the Galaxy is the most direct way to investigate the origin of
              stellar  masses.  The young stellar objects in molecular clouds in our Galaxy 
              are strongly bound and have not had time to wander far from their  birthplace. 
              Interpretation of the observed peaks or low-mass cut-offs  in the mass function
              of a young stellar cluster can reteal a possible  characteristic or minimum
              mass for star formation which can be related  to the local and global
              environment.  However, infrared wavelength  observations are needed to probe
              through the obscuring dust in these  regions and new techniques must be
              developed to estimate stellar masses  for pre-main-sequence stars from infrared
              data alone.  Infrared  wavelength array detectors will be used to observe a
              flux-limited  sample of sources emitting at 2 micron wavelengths in the Rho
              Ophiuchi  cloud core.  A scheme will be devised to identify a subset of this 
              sample which is in a T Tauri star type phase of evolution, for which  the
              stellar photospheres can be corrected for obscuration effects, and  using
              recent theoretical models for a given stellar age, the  luminosities and masses
              of the stars can be derived.  To supplement  this observational sample of
              stars, new and sensitive X-ray, Hydrogen  alpha, and radio wavelength continuum
              observational surveys will be  used to identify young stars with little or no
              infrared excess.  The  goal is to produce a mass function for 100-150 young
              stellar objects in  the cloud.  As a check on the scheme that is planned,
              infrared  wavelength spectroscopic observations of stars will be used to 
              determine the spectral types of the stars and to independently estimate  the
              ages and masses of the starq.  In the course of the investigations,  other
              important issues concerning the Rho Ophiuchi cloud core will be  considered;
              such as the number of low-luminosity embedded sources, the  three-dimensional
              distribution of young stars, the freque ncy of binary  stars, and the degree of
              Hydrogen alpha wavelength emission variability  in pre-main-sequence stars. 
              Ultimately, the mass functions of several  star-forming regions with distinct
              physical environments will be  compared to see if significant differences do
              arise when comparing the  different star forming regions.
