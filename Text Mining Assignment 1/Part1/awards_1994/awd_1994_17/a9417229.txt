Abstract    :
              DePoy, Darren  94-17229  DePoy will determine the initial mass function for the
              NGC 2024 star cluster by constructing a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for the
              cluster members and comparing their positions to pre-main sequence evolutionary
              model tracks.  Infrared spectra will be obtained and used to estimate
              photospheric temperatures; infrared images will be obtained and used to
              estimate luminosities.  The study will include all stars in the cluster with
              masses greater than about 0.4 solar masses, about 200-300 stars.  ***
