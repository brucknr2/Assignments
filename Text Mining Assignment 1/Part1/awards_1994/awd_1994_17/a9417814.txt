Abstract    :
              9417814  Birchler  The white locus of  Drosophila melanogaster will be used as a
              target gene to study the action of trans-acting dosage modifiers and their
              potential involvement with coordinate gene expression, dosage compensation,
              aneuploid syndromes, quantitative traits and position effect variegation. As an
              approach to the ultimate goal, examples of dosage sensitive regulators will be
              cloned and characterized, interactions between such dosage sensitive regulators
              and the male specific lethal locus characterized and a search for recessive
              mutations which modify the white gene will be made.  %%%  The regulation of
              gene expression in multicellular organisms is not a simple linear mechanism. A
              number of different mechanisms have been or are being described . Over the past
              several years a regulatory network that results in an inverse dosage effect on
              the expression  of the genes which they affect has been analyzed by this
              laboratory and this analysis will be continued.  ***
