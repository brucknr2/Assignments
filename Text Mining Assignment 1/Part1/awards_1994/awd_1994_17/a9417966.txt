Abstract    :
              This research is on algorithms for synthesis and layout of VLSI  designs. 
              Algorithms for complex, large industrial type design  problems are being
              developed.  Topics include: (1) high level  synthesis with testability as a
              goodness measure, (2) timing driven  placement for FPGAs, (3) channel and
              switchbox routing in which  cross talk considered, and (4) application of
              optimization  techniques to enhancing the effectiveness of the fabrication 
              process.  Approaches include: assessing the effects of register  allocation and
              binding on testability; use of neighborhood graphs  to guide iterative design;
              and integer programming to solve routing  problems.  Software incorporating the
              algorithms as design tools is  also being developed.
