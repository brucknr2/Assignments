Abstract    :
              Branch, David   AST 94-17102  This research will analyze and interpret the
              observed photon spectra of Type I supernovae (those lacking conspicuous
              hydrogen lines in their optical spectra) to constrain the elemental composition
              of the ejected matter as a function of the electron velocity.  Further studies
              will include calculations of theoretical spectra for comparison with observed
              spectra of Type Ia, Type Ib, Type Ic and Type II supernovae; determination of
              ejected mass, the radius of the exploding star, the kinetic energy of the
              ejected matter, the amount of radioactive Nickel ejected and the amount of
              mixing which occurs in the ejecta; and analysis of observations of radio
              emission from supernovae and supernova remnants in external galaxies.   ***
