Abstract    :
              9417585  Veblen   This award provides partial funding for a technical support
              position in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at The Johns Hopkins
              University. The technician will support the operation and maintenance of the
              combined electron microprobe and electron microscope laboratories at Johns
              Hopkins. The University is committed to providing the remaining funds necessary
              to support the technician's position during the two year duration of this award
              and will underwrite the total cost of the position after the award period. The
              operation of the electron microprobe and electron microscope laboratories is
              essential to a number of ongoing research and graduate training programs in the
              Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences and other departments at Johns
              Hopkins, including Biophysics, Materials Science and Engineering, Mechanical
              Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Geography and Environmental Engineering, and
              Physics and Astronomy, as well as a significant number of off-campus
              researchers.  ***
