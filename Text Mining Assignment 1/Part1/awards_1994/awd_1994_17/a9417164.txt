Abstract    :
              9417164  Turco    This award supports the participation of 10 U.S. scientists in
              a  U.S.-Japan seminar on Climate Phenomena in the Pacific Basin and  Rim, to be
              held at the University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan in  November 1995.  The
              co-organizers are Dr. Richard Turco of the  University of California at Los
              Angeles and Dr. Taroh Matsuno of  the Center for Climate Qystem Research at the
              University of  Tokyo.  The joint seminar will bring together experts on climate
               observations, analysis and modeling to review the status of  atmosphere/ocean
              modeling and prediction, to identify research  needs and to encourage new
              projects directed toward improving  climate predictability.  One principal
              objective of the seminar is to  initiate collaborative research in global
              climate change between  Japanese and American scientists, consistent with the
              U.S.-Japan  agreement on Global Change research.    A previous
              interdisciplinary workshop on climate processes  arranged by the PIs was
              successful in opening new avenues of  communication and collaboration between
              scientists on both sides  of the Pacific basin.  This seminar builds upon that
              success to  encourage and develop new collaborative research projects and 
              strengthen ongoing collaborative efforts.  ***
