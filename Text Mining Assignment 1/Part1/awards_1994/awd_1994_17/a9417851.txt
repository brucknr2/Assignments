Abstract    :
                This award supports a project to characterize Antarctic  meteorites by
              measuring natural thermoluminescense (TL) levels.  This work is part of the
              basic characterization program carried  out on all Antarctic meteorites and is
              used to determine future  research avenues on the Antarctic meteorites.  This
              program will  measure the natural TL levels in as many Antarctic meteorites as 
              possible and will make the data rapidly available to the  community.  The data
              will be used to determine pairing  (fragmentation), orbital distribution,
              estimate approximate  terrestrial ages of meteorites, and to identify
              meteorites with  unusual thermal and radiation histories or those that are 
              mineralogically unusual.  To enhance the value of these data,  studies are also
              conducted on natural TL profiles in other  extraterrestrial samples (large
              meteorites and lunar samples) and  comparisons are made between TL data and
              cosmogenic radionuclide  abundances.  Over the course of this award, the
              natural TL  laboratory will (1) continue systematic measurement of the  natural
              TL of all suitable Antarctic samples as part of their  preliminary screening,
              (2) examine pairing and natural TL  distributions for individual Antarctic
              sites, where several very  large pairing groups may exist, (3) continue the
              detailed  compilation of pairing data, and (4) perform theoretical and 
              experimental studies to use in the interpretation of TL data in  Antarctic
              meteorites, including additional studies of modern  falls, lunar samples, and
              of finds from other regions of the  world.
