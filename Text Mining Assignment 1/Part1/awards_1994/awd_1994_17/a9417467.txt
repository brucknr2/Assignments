Abstract    :
                9417467  Rajala    This is a "TIE" project on the topic of "Realizability of
              Potential  of Multiuser Detection," to be conducted by the Industry/University 
              Cooperative Research Center for Communications and Signal  Processing at North
              Carolina State University and the  Industry/University Cooperative Research
              Center for Wireless  Information Networks at Rutgers University.    The
              proposed activity is to conduct research to increase  realizability and
              capacity of CDMA (Code-Division Multiple Access)  systems. The proposed project
              will concentrate on the ability of  multiuser detectors to combat multipath
              fading present in the  actual mobile environment.    This project is being cost
              shared with the Industry/University  Cooperative Research Center for Wireless
              Information Networks at  the Rutgers University.    The Program Director
              recommends the North Carolina State University  be awarded $50,000 for 24
              months for this "TIE" project with  Rutgers University.
