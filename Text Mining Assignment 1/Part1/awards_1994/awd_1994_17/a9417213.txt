Abstract    :
              Filippenko  9417213  This research represents a concentrated effort to determine
              the   nature of the progenitor stars, the explosion mechanisms, and the  
              nucleosynthetic products of different types of supernovae.  The   results will
              have broad implications for topics as diverse as the   chemical evolution of
              galaxies, the birthrate of pulsars, and   cosmology.  The adopted approach is
              largely observational, coupled   with theoretical modeling.  A vigorous search
              for new supernovae in   nearby galaxies will be conducted with an automated
              imaging telescope   at Leuschner Observatory, thereby extending an effort that
              began over   a year ago.  Multi-color, long-term light curves of all
              sufficiently   bright supernovae will be obtained with a second robotic
              telescope at   Lick Observatory.  High-quality optical spectra will also be
              obtained   with state-of-the-art equipment in order to study the temporal  
              evolution and statistical properties of supernovae.  Thorough   analysis of the
              data should lead to the development of a more   complete classification scheme
              that focuses on fundamental   parameters.  Besides providing deeper insights
              into their origins and   physical characteristics, quantitative assessment of
              the observed   properties of nearby supernovae should improve the potential of 
               supernovae for cosmological distance determinations.  The newly   commissioned
              Keck 10-meter telescope will be used to obtain spectra   of very distant
              supernovae, in an attempt to measure the expansion   rate and overall curvature
              of the Universe.  ***
