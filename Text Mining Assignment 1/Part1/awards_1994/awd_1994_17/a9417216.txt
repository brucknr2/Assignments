Abstract    :
              9417216  Keizer    This project connects Lane Community College to the Internet
              over  a 56kbps line.  Faculty and students at the schools benefit from  access
              to the resources of the Internet, including libraries and  supercomputers.  In
              addition, they are able to communicate and  collaborate with colleagues at
              other institutions in pursuit of  research and educational projects.  The award
              provides partial  support of the project for two years.
