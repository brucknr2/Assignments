Abstract    :
              9417276  Lazonick    This award supports a three-year cooperative research
              project between  Dr. William Lazonick of the University of Massachusetts-Lowell
              and  Dr. Kazuo Wada of the University of Tokyo. The objective of this 
              cooperative research project is to study indigenous innovation in  materials,
              machines, and intersectoral technology transfer as well as  the role of
              national technology policy in promoting and facilitating  indigenous
              innovation.  By comparing the experiences of  Great  Britain, the United
              States, and Japan, the collaborators will analyze  the distinctive national
              characteristics of technology in the transition  from textiles to automobiles. 
              This project expects to make the  analysis of successful industrial development
              in advanced economies  relevant to the experiences of less developed and
              developing  economies.    This proposal brings together research scientists
              from two countries  working on the biochemical properties of wood.   Dr.
              Eriksson s  group has extensive knowledge and experience in biochemistry of 
              cellulolytic enzymes including CDH.  The team led by Dr. Samejima  has worked
              on enzymatic surface analysis of cellulose and pulp.  By  combining these
              expertises, the two groups can achieve a deeper  understanding and more rapid
              progress than can either group alone.   Therefore, this proposal fulfills the
              objectives of the Program in its  exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge
              through an international  collaboration.  ***
