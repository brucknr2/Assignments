Abstract    :
              9417259  Murphy  St. Joseph College requests support from NSF for connection of 
              its campus network to the wide-area network provided by the  University of
              Maine.  They will provide operations management and  information services and
              it will give the college a 56 thousand  bits per second connection to the
              NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45  million bits per second) National Backbone
              network.    Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.  By 
              linking to the mid-level and national networks St. Joseph's  faculty and
              academics will maintain a position of leadership in  research and educational
              innovation by profiting from remote  access to super computer centers, data
              bases and information  services, high speed communications, file transfer and
              remote  login, and access to library resources. This is also a unique 
              opportunity for the school to explore innovative educational  resources.
