Abstract    :
                The Small Grants for Exploratory Research is a mechanism at the National
              Science Foundation to provide support for small-scale, exploratory, high-risk
              research in all fields of science.  Dr. Silver has found the appearance of
              non-neuronal cell types in the brain following specific behaviors associated
              with reproduction. She has presented evidence to suggest that this new
              population of cells are mast cells of the immune system.   Dr. Silver and her
              students will now examine the appearance of putative mast cells by determining
              whether they are migrating into the brain in response to appropriate
              environmental and behavioral stimuli, or whether these cells preexist in the
              CNS but remain undetectable. She will also examine the influence of behavioral
              and endocrine state on this population of non-neuronal cells.  To accomplish
              this aim, Dr. Silver and her students will determine whether there is a sexual
              dimorphism in the distribution and number of putative mast cells and define the
              role played by gonadal and pituitary hormones in this phenomenon.  Finally, she
              will use state-of-the art anatomical techniques to characterize this population
              of cells as mast cells and determine whether they possess receptors for steroid
              and peptide hormones.  This research is appropriate for the SGER competition
              since it will provide strong preliminary work on a novel and exciting idea
              which opens a completely new direction in the field of behavioral
              neuroendocrinology.  The results could provide a new mechanism for
              peptide-hormone release in the brain as well as to establish an
              interrelationship between the immune and neural systems during normally
              occurring behaviors.
