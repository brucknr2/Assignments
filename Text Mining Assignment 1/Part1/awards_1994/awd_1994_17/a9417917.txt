Abstract    :
              9417917  Rutherford   This award provides partial (75%) funding for an upgrade
              to the electron microprobe installed and operated in the Department of
              Geological Sciences at Brown University. The institution is committed to
              providing the remaining funds necessary to carry out the project. The
              components of the upgrade will include a new computer for the operating system
              and a new wave-length dispersive X-ray spectrometer system. The electron
              microprobe is a heavily used analytical instrument combining accurate chemical
              composition measurement capabilities with micrometer scale spatial resolution.
              Several active research faculty and their students at Brown are dependent on
              the capabilities of the upgraded microprobe for their research in petrology,
              volcanology, planetary science, experimental geochemistry, and oceanography.
