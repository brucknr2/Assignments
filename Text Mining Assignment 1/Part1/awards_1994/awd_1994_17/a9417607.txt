Abstract    :
              9417607  Rugo  Nearnet represented by Bolt Beranek and Newman requests support 
              from NSF for connection of six institutions including: Albertus  Magnus
              College, Franklin Pierce Law Center, New England College,  Proctor Academy,
              Trinity College, and the Vermont Law School.  Nearnet is the NSF mid-level
              network that serves the New England  area.  Its primary goal is to facilitate
              collaborative projects  and sharing of resources between institution, including
              those  outside the state.    NEARnet will provide operations management and
              information  services and it will give the universities and colleges a 
              connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per  second)
              National Backbone network.    The each of the institutions has written a
              description of its  organization and a statement of the benefits of Internet
              access  that it expects including: greater functionality and network  speed to
              be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make  file transfers along
              with being able to implement a more reliable  mail system. Students and faculty
              research will benefit from the  links.  This is also a unique opportunity for
              the schools to  explore innovative educational resources.  Their diversity will
               expose NEARnet to a broader range of user requirements.  Nearnet  will use the
              information obtained by serving this diverse group  for the benefit of New
              England's academic and research community.
