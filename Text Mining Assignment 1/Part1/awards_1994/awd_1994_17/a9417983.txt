Abstract    :
              9417983  Thiq project is a study of the dynamic interaction of  transient
              weather systems with the surface katabatic wind  system inland from the Siple
              Coast in East Antarctica.  The  topography of the Siple Coast channels the cold
              air from  the interior into intense and persistent streams of  katabatic winds
              which flow out over the Ross Ice Shelf.    The periodic passage of
              synoptic-scale cyclonic storms  affects the structure and behavior of the
              surface wind  streams by reinforcing the surface flow into surge events, 
              extending for as much as a thousand miles across the Ross  Ice Shelf, and the
              katabatic winds may affect the  generation of cyclonic storms by forming a
              strongly  baroclinic zone on the Ice Shelf.    This project will integrate
              observations from a network of  nine automatic weather stations, multi-spectral
              satellite  imagery, and numerical modeling with the goal of testing  and
              elaborating upon hypotheses established from prior  investigations of the
              dynamics of katabatic winds.  Specific aspects to be addressed include the
              relative  importance of katabatic flows in West and East Antarctica, 
              evaluation of the impacts of pressure gradient and cloud-  radiative forcing,
              and the interaction of the katabatic  flow field with mesoscale cyclones.  ***
