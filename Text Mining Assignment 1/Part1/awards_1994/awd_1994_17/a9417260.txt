Abstract    :
              9417260  Sievers    This award supports the participation of eight U.S.
              scientists in a  U.S.-Japan seminar on New Far Infrared Sources, Detectors, and
               Solid State Measurement Techniques, to be held at the University of  Tokyo
              from October 8-13, 1995.  The co-organizers are Dr. A. J.  Sievers of Cornell
              University and Professor Keigo Nagasaka of the  University of Tokyo.  The
              incoherent synchrotron and coherent  transition radiation sources are being
              explored nearly simaltaneously  in both the U.S. and Japan.  But some of these
              sources, such as the  free electron laser and optoelectronic laser, are being
              developed  mainly in the U.S. while the tunable soslid state p-Ge laserKey 
              researchers from Japan and the U.S. will be brought together to  consider
              potential uses for   Site visits to the Fuji training Center and  the
              Synchrotron-orbital-radiation-ring facility will also part of the  agenda.   
              The seminar will foster the type of contact between Japanese and U.S. 
              scientists that can be expected to have significant influence on the  future
              course of the field.  The proposed participants and observers  have been
              selected for their past contributions and current activity in  the field and
              the meeting can be expected to produce concrete plans  for future cooperation
              and exchange.  Therefore, this proposal fulfills  the objectives of the Program
              in its exchange and transfer of scientific  knowledge through an international
              collaboration.  ***
