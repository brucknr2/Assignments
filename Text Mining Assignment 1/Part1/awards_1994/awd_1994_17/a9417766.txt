Abstract    :
              Willet  9417766  Relative convergende between lithospheric plates cannot be
              described by the simple kinetic rules of plane tectonics.  Convergence leads
              inevitably to deformation of one or both plates.  In the case of continental
              collision, convergence produces dramatic deformation with attendant uplift,
              erosion, mountain building and high relief.  This most spectacular of the
              Earth's tectonic processes is the cause of much of the Earth's conctinental
              geology throught eh formation fo continents by successive collisions and
              mechanical accretion, but also important are the impacts of cllisional
              orogenesis on the ancient and modern atmosphere, biosphere, and hydrosphere. 
              Mountain building processes affect global atmospheric circulation patterns and
              hence global climate, but climate also affects mountain building through its
              effeciency in eroding excess topography.  Understanding and modeling the
              coupling and feedback between the lithospheric and atmospheric systems is one
              of the goals of the Earth Systems Evolution program of the Canadian Institute
              for Advanced Research of which this project is a part.  This project focuses on
              the lithospheric mechanical process component of the Earth system by numerical
              modeling of lithosoheric deformation and comparison to geological (surface) and
              geophysical (subsurface) observations in orogenic belts.  ****
