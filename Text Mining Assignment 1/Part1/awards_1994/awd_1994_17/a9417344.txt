Abstract    :
              9417344  Sengupta    This award supports the participation of seven U.S.
              scientists in a  U.S.-Japan seminar on Thermal Engineering for Global
              Environmental  Protection, to be held in San Francisco, California from July
              10-14,  1995.  The co-organizers are Dr. Subrata Sengupta of the University  of
              Michigan-Dearborn and Professor Taeko Sano of Tokai University.  The seminar
              will address the influence of thermal engineering in  pollutant formation,
              control, and dispersion.  Topics to be discussed  include: thermal process in
              pollutant formation and control; thermal  engineering for energy conservation;
              and local and global impact of  dispersion in the environment.    This meeting
              is the fourth in a series of U.S.-Japan seminars in this  field held over a
              period of 10 years.  Although a core of individuals  has provided continuity
              from meeting to meeting, participants in the  seminars have changed through the
              years to reflect an appropriate  pairing between U.S. and Japanese participants
              and the progress of the  research.  The U.S. participants provide a broad cross
              section of  expertise and geographical representation in the general area of 
              thermal engineering, and were selected on the basis of being the most  active
              researchers in the U.S. Therefore, this proposal fulfills the  objectives of
              the Program in its exchange and transfer of scientific  knowledge through an
              international collaboration.  ***
