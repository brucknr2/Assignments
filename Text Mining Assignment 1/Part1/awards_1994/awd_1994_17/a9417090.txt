Abstract    :
              Gayley, Kenneth G.  9417090    Gayley will continue his NSF-supported research
              on resonance line formation and profile diagnostics.  The goal is to extend the
              analytical diagnostics derived so far to a wider class of resonance profiles. 
              Instead of assuming an isolated two-level atom as he has done so far, he will
              focus on the more general effects of background continuum opacity, resonance
              line blending, and the diagnostics of cross-redistribution.  This research is
              applicable to interpreting spectra of cool star atmospheres, in particular
              observations of cool chromospheres whose temperatures are depressed by line
              cooling.  ***
