Abstract    :
              9417553  Graham  This is an integrated geochemical and geophysical 
              investigation of the poorly-studied, 930 km-long portion of  the Southeast
              Indian Ridge straddling the Amsterdam-St. Paul  hotspot platform. Hypotenses on
              the tectonics of mid-ocean  ridges and flow in the oceanic upper mantle,
              particularly  the interaction between hotspots and mid-ocean ridges, will  be
              tested.  There is also an exploratory aspect of the  project in the geochemical
              characterization of a little  known section of the ridge  ***
