Abstract    :
              9417365  Puentedura  Bennington College requests support from NSF for connection
              of  its campus network to the New England wide area network, NEARnet.  NEARnet
              will provide operations management and information  services and it will give
              the University a 56 thousand bits per  second connection to the NSFNET, a high
              speed (1.5 - 45 million  bits per second) National Backbone network.   
              Bennington College is a national site in Apple Computer's New  Media Center
              Program and as such it is a natural companion in  bringing a full range of
              current technologies to bear on liberal  education.  The college's pedagogy is
              traditionally hands-on in  all subjects; access to the Internet will greatly
              extend the  direct reach of Bennington's faculty and students.
