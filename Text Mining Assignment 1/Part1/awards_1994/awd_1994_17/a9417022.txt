Abstract    :
              9417022  Rankin  The American Mathematical Society requests a grant in the
              amount of $110,688  for the twenty--fifth AMS-SIAM Summer Seminar in Applied
              Mathematics, to be  held in the summer of 1995. Previous seminars were held
              annually or at two or  three year intervals since 1957 for a total of 24
              seminars.  The 1995 topic, "Mathematics of Numerical Analysis", was selected by
              the 1993  AMS-SIAM Committee on Applied Mathematics.  Members of the Organizing
               Committee for the 1995 Sumer Seminar are:  Stephen Smale (chair), Gene 
              Allgower, Lenore Blum, Alexandre Chorin, Phillippe Ciaret, Felipe Cucker, 
              James Demmel, Ron DeVore, Gene Golub, Arieh Iserles, Bert Jongen, Herb Keller, 
              J.L. Lions, Jim Renegar, Michael Shub, Gilbert Strang, Shmuel Winograd  and
              Henryk Wozniakowski.        The 1995 Summer Seminar will be held during a
              four-week period in  July/August, 1995, at Park City, Utah.  The Society will
              be responsible for  making suitable arrangements for lecture and seminar rooms,
              and for handling  administrative matters.
