Abstract    :
              9417605  Sheridan  The objective of this proposal is to obtain a better
              understanding of the physical and geochemical processes related to the giant
              1964 eruption of Shiveluch Volcano, Kamchatka.  The eruptive event and products
              of Shiveluch, the focus of this research, will be compaped with published
              information and reconnaissance field work on the other major edifice destroying
              eruptions  Kusdach (1907), Bezymianny (1956), and Mount St. Helens (1980) . 
              The goal will be to understand the similarities and differences of these four
              major eruptions.  Field and laboratory studies will ascertain the nature of
              processes leading to the explosive rupture of the eruptive system and the
              mechanism responsible for the lateral transport of the materials.  Integrated
              study of the eruptive history of the entire volcano and the petrologic and
              geochemical character of the juvenile products will provide data to determine
              possible relationships among:  characteristics of eruptive events, evolution of
              the melts, formation of volcanic debris avalanches, and occurrence of lateral
              blast eruptions.  This research would improve our understanding of a very
              important class of phenomena that has a significant impact on volcanic risk
              assessment and mitigation.  Results form this study also could prove useful for
              long-term prediction of eruptive behavior at other dangerous volcanoes.
