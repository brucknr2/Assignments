Abstract    :
              Abstract   Lubbock Methodist Hospital System - Howell R. Porter   Connection to
              NSFNET  Proposal No. NCR-9417124  This proposal for connecting the Lubbock
              Methodist Hospital  System to the Internet will facilitate rapid,
              cost-effective  access to the vast array of resources and services available on
               the Internet for faculty and students at the hospital.     It will enhance the
              research and education environment by  connecting the hospital network to the
              network at Texas Tech.   Texas Tech is connected to the Internet and THENET, a
              regional  network service in Texas, who will provide connectivity to the 
              Internet for Lubbock Methodist.
