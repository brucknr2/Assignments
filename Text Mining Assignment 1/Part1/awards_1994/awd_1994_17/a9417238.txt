Abstract    :
              9417238  Bebernes       Work supported by this Small Grant for Exploratory
              Research  award seeks to explore the nature of solutions of partial 
              differential equations in the neighborhood of singularities. More  precisely,
              in the evolution of combustion processes, solutions to  mathematical models
              only partially account for a description of  the temperature region after
              reaction begins. Such evolutionary  processes are typically initiated by
              boundary heat addition, by  localized volumetric heating, by passage of a
              dynamic wave or by  very fast compression.  Localized heating during the
              ignition  period creates regions in which the heat production rate  accelerates
              as the reactants are consumed.  These sharply focused  hot spots can create
              explosive bursts of power generation which  can trigger the propagation of
              reaction waves through the medium.   It is of both practical importance and
              theoretical interest to  understand how and why detonations might be produced
              in various  circumstances.  The goal of this exploratory, high risk project  is
              to attempt to analyze how precisely describable hot spot  profiles, known for
              realistic ignition models, initiate these  reaction waves and determine their
              evolution.  ***
