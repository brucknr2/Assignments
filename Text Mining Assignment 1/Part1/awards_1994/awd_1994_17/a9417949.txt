Abstract    :
              9417949  Dixon   This award provides partial (one-third) funding for the
              acquisition of a Fourier transform infrared microscope system to be installed
              and operated in the Department of Marine Geology & Geophysics at the University
              of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences. The main
              application of the instrument will be to determine H2O and CO2 contents in
              glass inclusions in crystals and glasses from igneous rock samples collected at
              mid-ocean ridges, oceanic islands, and volcanoes. The data acquired with the
              instrument will be used to address scientific problems related to the role of
              volatiles in volcanic eruption mechanisms.  ***
