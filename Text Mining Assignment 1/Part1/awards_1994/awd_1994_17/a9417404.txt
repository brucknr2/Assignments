Abstract    :
              9417404  Dick       This is an accomplishment based renewal of the principal 
              investigator's long term studies of abyssal peridotites.  The  principal
              investigator will study the harzburgite-dunite complex  drilled at the Hess
              Deep by the Ocean Drilling Program Leg 147,  the composition of the East
              Pacific Rise mantle from rocks  dredged from fracture zones, determine a North
              Atlantic melting  trend from dredges peridotites, and continue studies of
              abyssal  plagioclase peridotites.  ***
