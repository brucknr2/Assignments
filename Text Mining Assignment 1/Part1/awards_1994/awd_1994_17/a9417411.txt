Abstract    :
              9417411  McIntosh    Studies of arc-continent collisions provide valuable
              insights into  orogenic processes and continental accretion. The Taiwan
              orogenic  belt provides a modern example of this process, which has served as 
              an important model for studying ancient orogens now exposed on  land. Uplift
              rates measured along the collision suture in  southeastern Taiwan are among the
              fastest in the world, yet little  is known about the crustal structure beneath
              this region or the  mechanisms responsible for uplift at the critical
              transition from  subduction to collision located in the offshore to the south
              of  Taiwan.    The present project  will provide detailed new information with 
              which to examine Taiwan crustal structure and the collision  process. Data to
              be acquired include multi-channel seismic  reflection and seismic refraction
              data from the offshore region, as  well as simultaneous crustal refraction
              measurements on land. A  major advantage to undertaking such a study in Taiwan
              is that  progressively younger stages of the propagating collision can be 
              viewed by moving southward along the collision zone. Thus, the  detailed
              aspects of the collision process can be examined from an  evolutionary
              perspective. Results from the project will be critical  in planning drilling by
              the Ocean Drilling Program. This is a  cooperative project supported by
              scientists at four U.S.  institutions and the Institute of Oceanography of the
              National  Taiwan University.  ***
