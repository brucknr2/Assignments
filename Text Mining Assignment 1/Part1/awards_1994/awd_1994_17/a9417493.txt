Abstract    :
              9417493  Revenaugh    This research is to study the early portion of seismic
              high   frequency records dominated by complicated ground motions   comprising
              the coda of the direct body wave phases.  Energy within   the coda derives from
              many sources, including: source region   heterogeneity, mantle multipathing,
              and local site response, the   latter being an important contributor to strong
              ground motion and,   hence, to seismic hazard.  Recent work has drawn attention
              to the   role of scattering from topography and fault zone heterogeneity -  
              often 10's of kilometers away - in producing energetic coda   arrivals for
              large, local earthquakes.  Data from a number of   seismograph networks will be
              analyzed using a variant of Kirchoff   migration.  Once specific sites of high
              scattering potential have   been identified, their contribution to seismic
              hazard can be   further examined with short-term deployments of portable  
              seismographs.  This research is a component of the National   Earthquake Hazard
              Reduction Program.  ***
