Abstract    :
              Deutscher  9417610  The study of enzymes and metabolic processes in vitro can
              give only a partial picture of how  enzymes actually function in cells.  A
              growing number of investigators have begun to consider  how the interaction of
              macromolecules, their restricted movement, and the high concentration  of these
              components within cells all influence the catalytic action of enzymes in vivo. 
              This  information is at the forefront of an emerging discipline that is
              attempting to meld what is known  about cell structure, macromolecular
              organization, metabolic pathways, and enzyme mechanisms  into a coherent
              picture of how cells carry out their many metabolic processes.  %%%  The Gordon
              Research Conference on Enzyme Organization and Cell Function will meet in 
              Oxnard, California, January 15-20, 1995.  It is a multi-disciplinary meeting
              that brings together  enzymologists, structural biologists, cell biologists and
              molecular biologists who all share a  common interest in trying to understand
              how enzymes, and other macromolecules, are organized  and function within
              cells.  It is the aim of this conference to foster the interaction and exchange
               of ideas among the workers in diverse fields whose research is directed
              towards elucidating how  enzymes are organized and function in vivo.  ***
