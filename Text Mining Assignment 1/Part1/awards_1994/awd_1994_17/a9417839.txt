Abstract    :
              9417839  Carling    This award will partially support the travel and living
              expenses  for Dr. Donald E. Carling, Department of Plant, Animal  and Soil
              Science at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, while  he is on sabbatical leave
              in Australia.  Dr. Carling will be  working in collaboration with Dr. Philip
              O'Brien of the  School of Biological and Environmental Science at Murdoch 
              University located in Perth, Western Australia. The research   will focus on
              the genetic and molecular characterization of  Rhizoctonia solani, a parasitic
              plant fungi.  R. solani is an  important pathogen among crop plants, yet little
              is known  about its genetics, pathogenicity characteristics, and molecular 
              biology.    R.solani is divided into a number of subspecific groups called 
              anastomosis groups (AG) based upon the ability of hyphae of  related isolates
              to interconnect.  Research will be conducted on  collections of R. solani AG-3
              that are virulent on potato and  tobacco plants and on heterokaryotic and
              homokaryotic isolates of  AG-8 that are either virulent or avirulent on the
              roots of  potato and wheat plants.  Dr. O'Brien and his colleagues have  been
              studying the molecular biology of R. solani and have  perfected a technique of
              generating homokaryotic isolates with a  protoplast procedure used in studying
              mating and incompatibility  systems.  Dr. Carling and his group have been
              active in the  characterization of new anastomosis groupings.  The study 
              brings together the complementary skills of the two research  groups.  The
              research activity could ultimately lead to  increasing crop yields while using
              fewer chemical agents to  control disease.  The award is supported under the  
              U.S.-Australia Cooperative Science Program.  ***
