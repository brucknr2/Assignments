Abstract    :
              9417356  Eriksson    This award supports a two-year cooperative research project
              between  Dr. Karl-Erik Eriksson of the University of Georgia and Dr. Masahiro 
              Samejima of the University of Tokyo. The objective of this  cooperative
              research project is to construct a new enzymatic system  for cellulose surface
              analysis.  The investigators intend to exploit two  characteristics for
              cellulose surface analysis: high specificity for  substrate and high catalytic
              activity.  It will also be necessary to  further characterize specific
              antibodies for immunolocalization studies  as well as to examine the practical
              application of  cellobiose  dehydrogenases (CDH) to celluloses from a variety
              of industrial  processes.    This proposal brings together research scientists
              from two countries  working on the biochemical properties of wood.   Dr.
              Eriksson s  group has extensive knowledge and experience in biochemistry of 
              cellulolytic enzymes including CDH.  The team led by Dr. Samejima  has worked
              on enzymatic surface analysis of cellulose and pulp.  By  combining these
              expertises, the two groups can achieve a deeper  understanding and more rapid
              progress than can either group alone.   Therefore, this proposal fulfills the
              objectives of the Program in its  exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge
              through an international  collaboration.  ***
