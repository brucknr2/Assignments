Abstract    :
              9417939  Miller       The northern Basin and Range province is a 700 km wide
              region  of distributed Cenozoic extension between the unextended Colorado 
              Plateau and the Sierra Nevada.  This project will employ FT  analysis to
              examine the temporal and spatial details of this  extension to discern how many
               phases of extension occurred and  whether they were synchronous or diachronous
              and how the extension  may be related to and how the extension may be related
              to other  geologic phenomena such as magmatism or plate interaction.  Results 
              may help develop a more complete picture of how regional extensions  proceeds,
              which in turn may contribute to the assessment of various  competing models for
              the fundamental causes and processes involved.
