Abstract    :
              9417525  Mak         Hydroxyl radial (OH) is the primary oxidant of the earth's 
              atmosphere and so its concentration determines, to a large degree,  the
              lifetimes of a host of trace gases.  Carbon monoxide (CO) is a  reactive
              species which controls the OH concentration in many parts  of the remote
              atmosphere.  The isotopes of atmospheric carbon  monoxide can be used to
              constrain both the OH concentration as well  as the relative source strengths
              of CO.  In the first case, 14CO is  measured to constrain OH concentrations. 
              Since the 14CO cosmogenic  production rate is known, its loss rate, and
              therefore the average  OH concentration, can be deduced if the atmospheric
              inventory is  determined.  In the second case, the stable isotopes (13CO and
              C18O)  are measured to help assess the relative source strengths, since 
              certain sources of CO have characteristic isotopic signatures.         The main
              sources of CO are methane oxidation by OH, non-  methane hydrocarbon oxidation
              by OH, biomass burning, and fossil  fuel combustion.  However, the relative
              importance of these sources  is poorly known.  Determining the atmospheric
              abundance and  seasonality of the isotopes of CO will provide important 
              information concerning the relative magnitude of those sources.   During the
              1970's and 1980's CO has been increasing at a rate of  about 1% per year, but
              for the last three to five years, this trend  has reversed direction, and CO
              has been decreasing globally at a  rate of 6-7% per year.  The causes of these
              interannual variations  are not known.  Analysis of the isotopic composition of
              CO can help  constrain the relative source rates.         The PI proposes to
              build a clean air sampling system and  cryogenic vacuum extraction line which
              will allow for the  collection, separation, and analysis of air samples for the
               isotopes of carbon monoxide (14CO, 13CO, and C18O), and to then begin 
              measurement of these isotopes from air samples collected at the  Mauna Loa
              Observatory (in collaboration with the NOAA CMDL   facility) and from samples
              collected in-flight between California  and New Zealand.
