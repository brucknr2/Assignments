Abstract    :
                9417071  Campbell           The recently discovered photosynthetic prokaryotes
               Prochlorococcus spp., which contain a unique set of pigment  including divinyl
              chlorophyll a and b, have been shown to be  an important component of the
              phytoplankton community  contributing 25 to 60% of total chlorophyll biomass. 
              In  the subtropical central Pacific Ocean, Prochlorococcus  dominate in the
              upper 100 m of the water column in  chlorophyll and carbon biomass.  The
              primary goal of this  research is this research is to examine the factors which
               limit the growth and distribution of Prochlorococcus.  A  primary objective is
              to investigate the effects of light and  nitrogen-source on the growth of
              different Prochlorococcus  strains in culture and in the field.  Specifically
              the  research will conduct the following experiments on  laboratory cultures of
              Prochlorococcus: 1) compare the  effects of irradiance and nitrogen source on
              photosynthetic  parameters (P vs. I and N vs. I), nitrogen uptake rates and 
              growth rates; 2) determine nitrogen uptake rates of varying  Prochlorococcus
              populations in the central Pacific; and 3)  assess the ability of NH4 to
              inhibit NO3 and urea uptake in  Prochlorococcus.  In addition to the laboratory
              experiments,  four quarterly cruises will be conducted to station ALOHA in  the
              North Pacific where field populations of Prochlorococcus  will be compared with
              the distribution of other  phytoplankton species with depth and nutrient
              profiles.  Further, field populations of Prochlorococcus will be  assayed for
              growth rates, the effects of light intensity on  growth rate, and nutrients
              addition experiments.  Finally,  monoclonal antibody probes will be used to
              provide a means  of certain identification and enumeration of distinct 
              Prochlorococcus populations.
