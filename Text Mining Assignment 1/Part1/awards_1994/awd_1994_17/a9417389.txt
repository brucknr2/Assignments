Abstract    :
              9417389  Hughes     This grant is to provide approximately 20% of the support
              for the operations of the International Seismological Centre, in cooperation
              with the University of Reading, UK, which is the world's repository for seismic
              data from about 1,850 stations world-wide.  These data are used to compute
              hypocenters for approximately 36,800 earthquakes and explosions per year.  This
              service represents the most complete source of seismic event occurrences
              available, and the event locations and raw phase data are a major resource for
              researchers for structure of the earth and for seismic hazard and statistics. 
              This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction
              Program.  ***    ??
