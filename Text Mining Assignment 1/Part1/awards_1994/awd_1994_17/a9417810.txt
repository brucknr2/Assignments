Abstract    :
              9417810  Phillips    The end of the last glaciation was accomplished by a series
              of  major and abrupt climatic events.  It is clear that changes in the 
              atmospheric transport of water vapor played a key role in the  deglacial
              process.  Although these events apparently resulted in a  global secession of
              glacial conditions, the details of the sequence  of events is poorly known
              outside the North Atlantic region.  In  this project we propose to apply new
              geochronological and  paleohydrological methods to the interpretation of
              glacial and  lacustrine data in a single, closed drainage basin: the
              paleo-Owens  River system in the western Great Basin.  We will apply mass 
              spectrometric U/Th and cosmosgenic 36Cl dating to refining the  existing
              chronology for lacustrine deposits and shorelines in the  terminal basins. 
              This chronology will be compared with one derived  from cosmosgenic 36Cl and
              carbon-14 for glacial deposits and  surfaces in the eastern Sierra Nevada, at
              the headwaters of the  Owens River.  These new and refined chronologies will
              allow the  sequence of events for the glacial and lacustrine systems to be 
              compared with each other. The combined sequence  will then be  quantitatively
              interpreted in terms of climatic driving forces,  using a transient numerical
              energy and mass balance model.   Finally, the reconstructed climatic history
              can be compared with  recent ice core and marine sediment records of global
              conditions to  assess how the global events were reflected by changes in 
              temperature and water vapor transport in a continental   setting.
