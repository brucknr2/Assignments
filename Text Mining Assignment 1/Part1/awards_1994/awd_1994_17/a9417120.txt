Abstract    :
              9417120  Campos  The OCHNET/NSFNET Connection project will integrate the
              existing  network at Alton Ochsner Medical Foundation (AOMF) with the  NSFNET. 
              This integration will provide access to national  databases for all the
              components of the Divisions of Education  and Research.  This connection will
              also nourish peer  communication and data exchange with external collaborators.
                 Immediate benefits will include access to bibliographic databases  and
              electronic mail for the Division of Education, which  encompasses the Medical
              Library, Graduate Medical Education,  Continuing Medical Education, the School
              of Allied Health  Sciences, Medical Editing, Audio Visual Services and Medical 
              Editing.  It will also provide access to nucleic acid and protein  sequence
              databases and large-scale data exchanges with   collaborators which will
              enhance the Division of Research's  activities.
