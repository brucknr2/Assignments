Abstract    :
              9417759  Cowan       Brittle shear zones are common features in many tectonic 
              settings, yet in spite of the importance of brittle shear zones and  the
              probability that slip along some of them was seismogenic, there  is as yet no
              unifying kinematic model relating the mesoscopic  fabrics of the fault rocks
              within them to the strain paths or flow  types characterizing shear zone
              deformation.  This project will  combine field data with extensive modeling to
              help develop and test  the hypothesis that general coaxial shear is the
              predominant flow  type as it is in ductile shear zones.  Results are expected
              to  improve the ability to interpret and kinematically analyze fabrics  in
              brittle shear zones.
