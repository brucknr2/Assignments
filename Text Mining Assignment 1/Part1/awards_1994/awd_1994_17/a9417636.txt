Abstract    :
              9417636 Dunand  This grant examines the high temperature mechanical properties
              and microstructure of oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) aluminum and
              magnesium alloys.  A unique combination of particle size, volume fraction, and
              grain size allows the probing of the fundamental  mechanisms of dispersion
              strengthening.  The alloys feature  oxides with: (1) volume fraction from 20 to
              30 vol.% (above typical values for mechanically-alloyed or
              precipitation-strengthened alloys); (2) particle sizes between 0.2 and 0.8
              microns (smaller than metal matrix composites, but larger than
              mechanically-alloyed or rapidly-solidified alloys); (3) grain sizes that are
              either very fine, 0.5 microns, or very coarse, 1 centimeter, spanning a larger
              range of sizes than most dispersion strengthened alloys.  Samples are tested in
              uniaxial tension at elevated temperatures in a range of strain rates. 
              Transmission electron microscopy is used to study dislocation interaction with
              oxide particles.  This research allows examination of issues such as the nature
              of the threshold stress, dislocation climb phenomena at particle-matrix
              interfaces, and the role of grain and subgrain boundaries in the deformation of
              dispersion-strengthened alloys. %%% The scientific goal is to correlate the
              microstructure with the mechanical properties through micromechanical modeling
              of the dislocation-particle interactions in the novel situation of very high
              volume fractions of unshearable particles.  This research could lead to
              improved high temperature, lightweight metal alloys for structural
              applications. ***
