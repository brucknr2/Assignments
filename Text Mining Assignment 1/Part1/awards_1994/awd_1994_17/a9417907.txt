Abstract    :
              9417907  Eich    This award will partially support travel, living expenses   and
              publication costs for Dr. Margaret H. Eich and a   graduate research assistant
              from Southern Methodist University   to conduct cooperative research with Dr.
              Maria Orlowska and  Dr. Robert Colomb, of the Department of Computer Science at
              the  University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia.  The  collaborative
              research will focus on developing new checkpointing  and recovery algorithms
              aimed at distributed databases.    Database checkpointing saves the state of a
              database on a stable  memory separate from the primary database copy.  In the
              event of  a failure of a primary copy, the loss can be restored using the 
              backup copy of the log.  Checkpointing techniques so far examined  by the
              Southern Methodist group require no synchronization  between transactions and
              checkpointing, and also facilitate a  partial recovery of the database after
              failure.  These features  are desirable for both a high throughput Main Memory
              Database  (MMDB) system, and also for a distributed database environment.   
              Objectives for this cooperative work are to examine techniques  for extending
              MMDB recovery to distributed databases.  The  specific work to be conducted
              will apply partition checkpointing  to distributed database environments, will
              expand commit and  partial recovery algorithms for distributed environments,
              and  will perform initial analytic studies validating the developed 
              approaches.  ***
