Abstract    :
              9417265  Theofanous    This award supports the participation of 10 U.S.
              scientists in a U.S.-  Japan seminar on Intense Multiphase Interactions, to be
              held in Santa  Barbara, California from June 9-13, 1995.  The co-organizers are
              Dr.  Theofanis Theofanous of the University of California at Santa Barbara  and
              Professor Mamoru Akiyama of the University of Tokyo. This  seminar will address
              a single, very special, phenomenon known as   Steam (or Vapor) Explosion.   The
              phenomenon is of great interest  to several diverse fields including
              volcanology, industrial safety, and  in the production of specialty materials. 
              Progress in the  understanding of this phenomena has been slow but definite,
              due  primarily to major advances in computing power and experimental 
              techniques.  This seminar will also enhance progress in this area.     The U.S.
              participants provide a broad cross section of expertise and  geographical
              representation in the area of heat transfer and fluid  mechanics, and were
              selected on the basis of being the most active  researchers in the U.S.
              Therefore, this proposal fulfills the objectives  of the Program in its
              exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge   through an international
              collaboration.  ***
