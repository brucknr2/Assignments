Abstract    :
              9417088  Archibald    This project represents a collaborative research effort by
               San Diego State University, the Natural History Museum  (Chiba) and the
              National Science Museum (Tokyo) in Japan.  The project will focus on
              morphological study of well  preserved skulls and limb elements of fossil
              pinnipeds  (seals, sea lions and walruses) from Japan in rock deposits  that
              span the late Oligocene through the Pleistocene (27-.5  million years ago). Of
              special interest are basal pinnipeds  ancestral to the major groups of living
              pinnipeds. These  archaic fossil pinnipeds from Japan are second only to those 
              in the US in number and diversity of species, making them of  critical
              importance for studies of early pinniped evolution.  By comparative study of
              these specimens in Japan and the US,  the investigators wil be able to test
              current hypotheses of  the evolutionary relationships among pinnipeds and their
               biogeographic history in the North Pacific. Project funding  will enable a
              leading expert in the US and a graduate  student to study fossil pinnipeds
              housed in various museum  collections in Japan over the next three years.  *** 
                This project in systematic biology and paleontology will  enable the
              initiation of collaborative work between  colleagues in Japan and the US. This
              valuable collaboration  represents a necessary first step toward the
              development of  a comprehensive assesssment of pinniped origins and 
              diversification in the North Pacific.
