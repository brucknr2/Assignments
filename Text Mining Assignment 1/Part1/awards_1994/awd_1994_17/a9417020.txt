Abstract    :
              9417020  Perry    This award will support the participation of twelve U. S. 
              investigators to take part in a workshop in the area of high  performance, wear
              resistant films. The meeting will be held  in Sydney, Australia in February
              1995. The American coordinator  is Dr. Anthony J. Perry, Director for Research
              and Technology   at ISM Technologies, Inc. located in San Diego, California.  
              The Australian organizer is Dr. Philip J. Martin, Research  Scientist with the
              Surface Engineering Group at the CSIRO  National Measurement Laboratory in
              Sydney. The workshop is  being conducted under the U.S.-Australia Cooperative
              Science  Program and support in Australia is provided through the  Department
              of Industry, Science and Technology (DIST).    Hard films made by Physical
              Vapor Deposition (PVD) improve both  wear and corrosion resistance of surfaces.
              The critical issues  are the preparation and treatment of the film-substrate
              interface  for maximum adhesion, the formation of dense, mechanically robust 
              films, and the measurement and control of film properties. The  workshop will
              bring together leading researchers in the  significant areas of broad based PVD
              studies. The U.S.  participants to the workshop will bring expertise in the 
              measurement and control of film mechanical properties; the  Australian side has
              considerable expertise in PVD technology in  sputtering and cathodic arc
              evaporation. It is anticipated that  workshop manuscripts will be published in
              connection with the  scientific journal Surface Coatings and Technology.
