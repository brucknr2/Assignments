Abstract    :
              ***  9417857  Ke    This award supports collaborative work between Hengming Ke, 
              University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and Fan Haifu,  Institute of
              Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing,  on application of direct
              methods in determination of  macromolecular structure.  The importance of the
              proposed  research lies in its potential contribution to fields of  structural
              biology, where the ability to determine  macromolecular structures quickly and
              routinely would be  very valuable.  Current methods are time-consuming and 
              cumbersome, as noted in the reviews.  The two PIs bring  complementary
              expertise to the research:  Ke has experience  and expertise in the
              determination of protein structures and  Fan is a recognized authority in
              direct methods.  Thus, the  joint project brings together two groups with
              specialization  in different fields of crystallography.  Support on the 
              Chinese side will be provided by the Chinese Academy of  Sciences.  ***
