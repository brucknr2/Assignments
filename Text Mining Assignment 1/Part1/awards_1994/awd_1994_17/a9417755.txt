Abstract    :
              9417755  Allen  The ability of local density approximation band theory to
              predict  properties of matter will be explored.  Algorithms will be tested  to
              make global searches for ground-state crystal structures.   Magnetic
              excitations and electrical resistivity of metals will be  calculated. 
              Vibrational energy relaxation in carbon-sixty will be  modeled.  %%%  Theory
              will be used to predict properties of crystalline matter  starting from
              fundamental concepts.  Specifically, methods for  predicting the crystal
              structure, magnetism and electrical  conductivity of materials will be
              developed and applied to various  real materials of current interest.  These
              methods, if successful  will have wide applicability.
