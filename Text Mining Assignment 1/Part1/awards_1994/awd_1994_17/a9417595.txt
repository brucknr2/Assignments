Abstract    :
              9417595  Kazovsky  Wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) is rapidly evolving as
              a key technology for future optical networks ranging from local area networks
              (LANs) to wide-area networks (WANs).  Third-order fiber nonlinearities
              (self-phase modulation (SPM), cross-phase modulation (XPM) and four-wave mixing
              (FWM) set limit on the capacity of WDM networks.  We propose to investigate,
              both theoretically and experimentally, the effect of XPM and FWM produced on
              one wavelength channel by the others, by investigating the statistics of
              amplitude and frequency noise produced by these effects.  We will
              quantitatively evaluate penalties imposed by XPM and FWM on measure on system
              performance, such as bit error rate (BER) and eye closure.  We will investigate
              techniques for minimizing the impact of XPM and FWM by varying optical power,
              number of wavelengths, channel spacing, modulation frequency and format,
              dispersion, coding, polarization, and receiver type.  Through this
              investigation, we will develop quantitative models of the impact of XPM and FWM
              on WDM systems, techniques to minimize this impact, and techniques to achieve
              optimum system performance consistent with the unavoidable presence of
              nonlinear effects in such networks.  ***
