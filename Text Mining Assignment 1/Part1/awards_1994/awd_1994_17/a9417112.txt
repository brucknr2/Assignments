Abstract    :
              Balick, Bruce   AST 94-17112  Balick and his group will investigate the mass
              loss mechanisms in evolved stars with visible nebulae.  His previous NSF grant
              support was to study and model the planetary nebulae around low mass stars. 
              This work iq the next step --  to extend the observations and the models to
              nebulae surrounding more massive stars -- the Luminous Blue Variables,
              Wolf-Rayet and Of-type stars.  ***
