              Abstract  ATM-9417563  Gray, William M.  Colorado State University  Title:
              Climate Analysis and Extended Range Seasonal Prediction    This project
              involves the analysis and further development of basic  scientific concepts
              related to extended range quantitative climatic  forecast schemes for Atlantic
              basin seasonal hurricane activity,  African Sahel seasonal rainfall, ENSO
              variations, selective  regional Asian monsoon rainfall, and the potential for
              seasonal  predictability in the middle latitudes.  Along with the basic 
              science concerning underlying mechanisms, this work seeks accuracy  at 9-14
              month forecast lead times, sufficient to allow the  development and
              implementation of meaningful policy and mitigating  actions.  The spectrum of
              potential climate precursor signals will  be exhaustively explored.  Potential
              predictability will be studied  in the hindcast mode, principally from global
              data sets for the  last 35 to 45 years (primarily since 1950), but with some 
              extensions to much earlier data.  Similarly, statistical regression 
              methodology for combining predictor signals using both Least  Absolute
              Deviations and Ordinary Least Squares procedures will be  extensively explored.
               Although surprisingly skillful seasonal  hindcast test results have been
              obtained, these results suggest  that greater forecast skill is possible
              through further analyses  with additional combinations of climate variables. 
              Equal emphasis  in this research is directed toward diagnostic work for greater
               physical understanding of the underlying atmospheric and oceanic  processes
              responsible for long range precursor signals.    This research is important
              because it seeks to improve our ability  to predict climate variations of major
              economic and human safety  importance.
