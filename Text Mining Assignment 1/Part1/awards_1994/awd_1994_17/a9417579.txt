Abstract    :
              9417579  Courter  The NC-REN, the North Carolina Research and Education Network
              is a  mid-level network that serves the State of North Carolina.  NC-REN  is
              connected directly to the NSFNET Backbone Network.  It is the  intention of
              NC-REN to offer NSFNET connections to all higher  education institutions in
              North Carolina.    This proposal requests support to establish ten new
              connections for  eight small private colleges and two community college located
               throughout the state: Barber Scotia College, Haywood Community  College,
              Livingstone College, Methodist College, Montreat-Anderson  College, NC Wesleyan
              College, Peace College, St. Andrews  Presbyterian College, Wilkes Community
              College, and Wingate  College.    A primary goal of NC-REN is to facilitate
              collaborative projects  and sharing of resources between institution, including
              those  outside the state.  NC-REN will provide operations management and 
              information services as well as provide appropriate dedicated  connections to
              the ten institutions listed above.     The colleges need greater functionality
              and network speed to be  able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make
              file transfers  along with being able to implement a more reliable mail system.
                Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.  This is  also a
              unique opportunity for the schools to explore innovative  educational
              resources.
