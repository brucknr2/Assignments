Abstract    :
              9417577  O'Halla  Davenport College requests support from NSF for connection of
              its  campus to MICHnet.  MICHnet is the midlevel network located in  the state
              of Michigan that will provide operations and network  information services.  It
              will give the Davenport College a 56  thousand bits per second connection to
              the NSFNET, a high speed  (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone
              network.    The college needs greater functionality and network speed to be 
              able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers  along with
              being able to implement a more reliable mail system.  Students and faculty
              research will benefit from the link.  This  is also a unique opportunity for
              the school to explore innovative  educational resources.
