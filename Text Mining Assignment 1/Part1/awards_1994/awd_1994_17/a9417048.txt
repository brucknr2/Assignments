Abstract    :
              9417048  Hickey  In this project, the PI will complete the analysis of data
              obtained  during the winter, 1990-91, in a study of the Columbia River Plume.  
              Formal data reports for CTD and moored array data will be prepared,  along with
              publications on plume dynamics.  Focus will be on the  momentum balance in the
              plume, effects of the plume on wind-driven  circulation over the inner shelf,
              merging of tidal fronts into the  plume, and the importance of interfacial
              mixing to plume  dispersion.  ***
