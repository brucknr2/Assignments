Abstract    :
                This award supports research in the area of typed lambda-calculi,   with
              special emphasis on the combinatorics, complexity, and logic    of type
              inference.  Specific problems concern type-  reconstruction,   type-checking,
              and related aspects, and are motivated by design   and implementation issues in
              programming languages.    Particular attention is given to algebraic
              characterizations of  these problems. Such characterizations give rise to new
              and  more general forms  of unification, in particular semi  unification, often
              with applications in  other parts of  computer science (term-rewriting systems,
              database theory,  computational linguistics).    Based on some of the same
              techniques,   the project explores problems in two research areas,   both with
              important applications: (1) higher-order matching \  (for automatic theorem 
              proving) and (2) extensions of ML-style   polymorphism (for polymorphically
              typed programming languages).
