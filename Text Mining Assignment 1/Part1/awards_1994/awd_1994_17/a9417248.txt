Abstract    :
              9417248  Turner    This award supports a two-year cooperative  research project
              between Dr. Edwin Turner of  Princeton University and Professor Masayuki 
              Umemura of the University of Tsukuba.  This  research will support a
              collaborative theoretical  investigation of the critical physical processes 
              that affected black hole formation very early in  the history of the universe
              and of observations  that might further illuminate the issue.  The  researchers
              will focus on hydrodynamics,  concentrating on the possibility that massive 
              black holes can form directly during the initial  collapse of protogalaxies at
              high redshifts.        The U.S. and Japanese investigators have all 
              independently carried out research programs in  the focus area..  The team led
              by Dr. Turner will  be concerned with observations whereas Professor  Umemura s
              group will concern itself with  numerical simulations.  By combining these 
              expertises, the two groups can achieve a deeper  understanding and more rapid
              progress than can  either group alone.  ***
