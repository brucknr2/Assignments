Abstract    :
              9417435  Jain            ABSTRACT      UCSD MS Program in World Class
              Manufacturing Engineering    The University of California, San Diego proposes
              to create a 2-year MS Program World Class Manufacturing Engineering with a
              strong international and information systems focus.  In partnerships with ALCOA
              Electronic Packaging, Hewlett-Packard, Hughes Aircraft, and TITAN Linkabit, it
              is targeted toward displaced defense engineers, particularly women and
              minorities.  Aiming to take advantage of manufacturing and management strengths
              overseas, the program has a unique emphasis on foreign language and culture
              learning (approximately 50% of the students) and includes a 9-month internship
              in a manufacturing firm in the U.S. or abroad.  With good support from
              institutions with strong international studies program, it expects a steady
              state of 30 students per year with expansion in later years to feed in
              undergraduates.  ***
