Abstract    :
              This award provides support for the Seventh International  Conference on Random
              Structures and Algorithms which will be held  in Atlanta on May 16-20, 1995. 
              The aim of this meeting is to  present recent research, and to identify and
              explore new  directions for further development, in random discrete 
              structures, randomized algorithms and broad areas of application  of
              probabilistic methods in discrete mathematics and computer  science.  In
              addition to the intrinsic interest of the  mathematics, these fields have
              numerous applications to such  subjects as the reliability of communication,
              neural networks,  percolation and polymerization processes, and sequencing DNA.
                 This research is in the general area of Combinatorics.  Combinatorics
              attempts to find efficient methods to study how  discrete collections can be
              organized.  The behavior of discrete  systems is extremely important to modern
              communications.  For  example, the design of large networks, as in telephone
              systems,  and the design of algorithms in computer science all deal with 
              discrete sets of objects, and this makes use of combinatorial  research.
