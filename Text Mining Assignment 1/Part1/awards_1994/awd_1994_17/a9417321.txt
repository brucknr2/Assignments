Abstract    :
              9417321  Turekian    The present-day high 187Os/186Os signature of osmium in the
              oceans  is the consequence of weathering of continental crust.  The supply  of
              crustal Os to the oceans is primarily effected through stream  transport.  The
              main form of labile Os appears to be an adsorbed  phase on stream particles. 
              Release and mobility of Os in the  estuarine environment is complex because of
              the processes of  oxidation and reduction occurring in the estuary zonally and
              with  depth in the sediment which act to sequester and release Os.  
              Anthropogenically mobilized Os, with a characteristically non-  crustal value
              of 187Os/186Os of about 1, has been identified in a  study of New Haven Harbor
              and transport from this site eastward  about 15km has been documented.  The
              extension of the study to Long  Island Sound and the Hudson River  using the
              comparable         anthropogenic Osimprint, probably from hospital waste from
              New York  City, will provide a measure of the mobility of Os in estuaries and 
              the flux to the open ocean.  Preliminary results indicate the  feasibility of
              such a study, the details of which are described in  greater detail in the
              following pages.
