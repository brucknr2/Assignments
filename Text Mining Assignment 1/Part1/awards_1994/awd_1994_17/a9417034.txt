Abstract    :
              \9417034  Blumenthal  This award is to provide support for the International
              C.elegans  Meeting to be held at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, 
              Wisconsin, June 1995 and June 1997.  Research on the nematode  Caenorhabditis
              elegans ranges from such global problems as the  functioning of an entire
              nervous system and the evolution of form  to the molecular bases of gene
              structure and function.  C. elegans  has become an important experimental
              organism for the study of many  aspects of animal biology, particularly the
              genetic and molecular  bases of development and behavior. The goal of the
              meeting is to  enhance exchanges of knowledge, methods, mutants, and clones
              which  is vital in establishing the sense of excitement and collegiality  that
              characterizes this field.  ***
