Abstract    :
              9417559  Landau    This award supports the participation of 12 U.S. scientists
              in a U.S.-  Japan seminar on New Trends in Computer Simulations of Spin 
              Systems, to be held in Honolulu from August 29-September 1, 1995.   The
              co-organizers are Dr. David Landau of the University of Georgia  and Professor
              Masuo Suzuki of the University of Tokyo. The purpose  of this seminar is to
              bring together U.S. and Japanese scientists in an  environment that is
              conducive to informal interaction in addition to  formal presentation. 
              Participants are leaders in different aspects of  computational physics, who
              come from diverse institutions in different  geographical areas of each country
              and who are at different stages of  their careers.  The topics of interest
              include the determination of  critical exponents in different spin models, the
              nature of phase  transitions in complex spin systems, and the development of 
              algorithms for both classical and quantum models.    The seminar will foster
              the type of contact between Japanese and U.S.  scientists that can be expected
              to have significant influence on the  future course of the field.  The proposed
              participants and observers  have been selected for their past contributions and
              current activity in  the field, and the meeting can be expected to produce
              concrete plans  for future cooperation and exchange.  Therefore, this proposal
              fulfills  the objectives of the Program in its exchange and transfer of
              scientific  knowledge through an international collaboration.  ***
