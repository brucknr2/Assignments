Abstract    :
              Mutel, Robert L.  94-17353  Mutel will conduct a three-year program to use the
              VLA and VLBA to investigate properties of non-thermal radio emissions from
              close, late-type binaries which show evidence for enhanced activity.  It is a
              3-part program: 1) to determine the spatial distribution of radio emission in
              the outer magnetospheres of several binaries with the VLBA; 2) to determine the
              frequency dependence of the polarization, spectra and time history of several
              classes of active binaries using the VLA; and 3) to use the VLA and VLBA
              observations to test and develop quantitative models for the geometry and
              dynamics of stellar magnetospheres for close binaries.  ***
