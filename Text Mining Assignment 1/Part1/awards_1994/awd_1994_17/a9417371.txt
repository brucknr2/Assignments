Abstract    :
              Thorne  9417371  Theoretical research will be conducted at the interface between
              general relativity theory and astrophysics studying the generation of
              gravitational waves by astrophysical objects.  A minor additional effort will
              study non-gravitational wave aspects of black holes and neutron stars.    The
              gravitational-wave research will be focused on waves detectable by LIGO (the
              Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) to identify what
              wave-generation computations are needed for LIGO.  Of special concern will be
              the waves produced in the last ~10 minutes of  the life of a binary system made
              up from neutron stars or black holes.    During these 10 minutes the two bodies
              spiral inward, producing  approximately 10,000 wave cycles that carry detailed
              information about the bodies' orbit, masses, and spins.  During the last few
              milliseconds the bodies violently coalesce, producing waves that carry
              information about the equation of state of nuclear matter in the neutron star
              case and about the nonlinear dynamics of space-time curvature in the black hole
              case.  The resulting waveforms must be computed to high accuracy for use as
              theoretical templates in analyzing LIGO data.  ***
