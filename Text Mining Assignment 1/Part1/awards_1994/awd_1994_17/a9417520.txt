Abstract    :
                    ABSTRACT  CTS-9417520  George Karniadakis       A three-dimensional
              numerical model will be formulated, programmed, and carried out to predict the
              unsteady velocity, vorticity, and temperature fields in the wake behind a
              heated circular cylinder. The proposed numerical model more correctly accounts
              for the three-dimensionality of the flow, and comparisons with the results of
              more traditional approaches will be made. Comparisons for validity will also be
              made with the experimental measurements of a co-funded project.
