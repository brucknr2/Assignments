Abstract    :
              9417569  Hassler  The Catholic University of America's School of Engineering has
               established a consortium of local-area high school that seeks to  introduce
              scientific and engineering concepts early in the  educational experience.  It
              is envisioned that this program will  promote engineering in the secondary
              schools, and provide a much  needed educational tool by providing a high speed
              modem  connection from each of the high schools (at present they  include:
              Elizabeth Seton High School; Georgetown Visitation  Preparatory High School;
              St. John's College High School; Gonzaga  College High School; Bishop Ireton
              High School; and DeMatha  Catholic High School) to the worldwide Internet
              through a  mentoring program at the School of Engineering.    Summer programs
              will provide teacher training on specific  engineering software applications
              and on general knowledge and  use of the Internet.    This project represents a
              strong beginning to what should be a  continuing effort in redefining the
              educational process in  science and engineering.
