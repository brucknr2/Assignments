Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  OPP-9417491  KRUSE    This proposal is for support of a North American
              Symposium on Harvest Assessment Methods in Rural Northern Communities. The goal
              is to better understand the factors, technical, cultural and political, that
              are critical to the success of fish and wildlife assessments. Harvest
              assessment improvements would help sustain productivity of resources important
              to northern communities and help reduce problems of undue government
              interventions in local resource harvesting. These issues are central to the
              development of effective and sustainable resource use in the Arctic.  ***
