Abstract    :
              9417445  Baker    The objective of this research is to measure the growth (by
              vapor  diffusion) and evaporation of individual ice crystals in the  laboratory
              using a new levitation technique, wherein the crystal is  suspended by
              superimposed (AC & DC) electric fields.  Temperature  and moisture will be
              controlled (0 to -50C) to reproduce plausible  atmospheric conditions.  ***
