Abstract    :
              9417706  Walker  The aim of this research project is to reach an understanding
              of planetary differentiation by igneous processes.  Methods of study to be used
              include melting and/or dehydration experiments, petrographic and microprobe
              studies and theoretical and numerical modeling.   Projects to be undertaken
              include: (a) exploration of liquid compositional dependence of the partitioning
              of siderophile elements between metal and silicate liquids - relative to
              planetary core formation's impact upon mantle siderophile element abundances,
              (b) development of a P-T-X saturation model for natural liquids in equilibrium
              with garnet-structured crystals, and (c) improvement of the doping properties,
              reliability, and availability of the LaCrO3 semiconductor heaters - relevant to
              the needs of this study and a wider community for methods of improved
              experimental heating with low thermal gradients.
