Abstract    :
                  9417753  KONDRASHOV   Recent experimental data suggest that many organisms
              experience high total rates of slightly deleterious mutations (1 or more per
              generation).  This means that selection against such mutations is intense and
              can influence various aspects of populations.  A general representation of
              mutation-selection balance will be developed, which allows for arbitrary
              patterns of selection, and for the evolution of genes that modify the genetic
              system.  This representation will be based on consideration of the number of
              mutant alleles in the genome, and on application of the methods of quantitative
              genetics of such traits.  This representation will be applied to investigate
              three problems: 1) the   evolution of the length of the haploid and diploid
              phases; 2) the coevolution of mutability and facultative asexuality or selfing;
              and 3) the coevolution of recombination and inbreeding.  Both mathematical and
              computer models will be used.  The results will contribute to the understanding
              of the general features of selection against slightly deleterious mutations,
              and of the evolution of life cycles, reproduction, and mutability.
