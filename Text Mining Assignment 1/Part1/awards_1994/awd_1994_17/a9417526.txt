Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  PERSSON  CTS-9417526    The proposed study is an Industry-University
              Cooperative Research Project between the New Mexico Institute of Mining and
              Technology and Nelson Brothers Inc.  The PIs propose a systematic study of the
              chemistry of ammonium nitrate (AN) and ammonium nitrate mixed with fuel oil
              (ANFO) at pressures similar to those encountered during the detonation of solid
              explosives.  The objective is to understand the fundamental mechanisms of
              reaction occurring in the detonation of these materials and to find additives
              which will reduce the red smoke thought to contain the oxides of nitrogen, NO,
              and NO2, that is generated when AN and ANFO are used as explosives especially
              at high pressures.    Three different laboratory experiments will be used to
              study the decomposition of these energetic materials.  These consist of (1)
              ignition and surface burning by contact with an adiabatically compressed heated
              inert gas, (2) shock compression by impact with a flyer plate, and (3)
              detonation of 1 kg charges in a closed chamber.  Reaction products will be
              analyzed by FTIR and GCMS.  These laboratory studies will be carried out at New
              Mexico.    Large scale field test at Nelson Brothers Inc., aimed at obtaining
              more information on the composition of the red clouds, and the testing of the
              new proposed compositions and blasting methods, will be carried out.  Color
              video and sampling of the product gases will be used and results compared to
              the conventional explosives.
