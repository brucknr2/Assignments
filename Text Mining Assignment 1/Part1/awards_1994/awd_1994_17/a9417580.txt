Abstract    :
              Wenk  9417580   The proposal is to investigate ductile deformation of
              polymineralic rocks and accompanying development of preferred orientation and
              anisotropy.  Finite element methods will be used to model deformation of
              crystal aggregates at the submicroscopic intragrain scale and compare results
              with analytical upper and lower bounds solutions.  Based on results
              constitutive equations for deformation of plastically anisotropy and
              heterogeneous polymineralic rocks can be proposed.  FEM methods will also be
              used to model large heterogeneous systems such as convection of the Earth's
              mantle, with more realistic geometry and material constraints than in a
              preliminary pilot study.  Instead of using a single number for viscosity to
              describe the material behavior as is done in classical isotropic convection
              studies, each element will contain an assembly of 500 grains and deform
              according to principles of strain compatibility and stress equilibrium.  These
              models of anisotropy convection based on polycrystal plasticity concepts will
              be useful  for geodynamics and seismology to understand development and
              interpretation of anisotropy of elastic waves.  ****
