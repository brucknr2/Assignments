Abstract    :
              9417188    Bisset    Description:  This project supports Dr. Michael  Bisset, a
              young U.S. physicist who received his  Ph.D. in 1994 from the University of
              Hawaii, to  spend one year as a postdoctoral scholar at the  Tata Institute of
              Fundamental Research (TIFR)  in Bombay, India.  During his stay at the TIFR  he
              will be engaged in research on collider  physics phenomenology, and in
              particular in the  search for particles of supersymmetry at hadron  colliders. 
              He will be collaborating with Dr.  D.P. Roy of the Theoretical Physics Group at
               the TIFR.    Scope:  The U.S. and the Indian scientists are  interested in the
              same area, namely the  phenomonology of Higgs and superparticle search  at
              supercolliders.  While the Indian scientist  is a leading figure in the field,
              the U.S.  scientist has contributed significantly to the  field, during his
              Ph.D. studies.  The  opportunity offered for Dr. Bisset to work at  one of
              India's best renowned institutes, and  with scientists of international
              reputation is  likely to further his scientific career, and to  enhance his
              research capabilities.  This  opportunity should also increase the potential 
              for future Indo-U.S. scientific collaboration  in the field of theoretical
              physics.  This  project meets the objectives of the Division   of International
              Programs.  ***
