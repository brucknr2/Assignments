Abstract    :
              9417971  Axelrod   Although numerous (50+) Middle Miocene (18-12 Ma) Floras have
              been collected and a good number described from the great Basin region, little
              is known of its vegetation and climatic history following 10 Ma.  This proposal
              plans to collect and describe 16 new fosssil floras dataed 10-5 Ma from the
              region and integrate them with described pollen floras that contain "sage" taxa
              that make up the present lowland flora but are unrepresented by megafossils. 
              Description and analysis of these floras will provide a resource for diverse
              fields of research.  1) Rates of climate change in the later Neogene and its
              role in modification of composition of floras and mammalian faunas.  2)
              Climatic conditions at these sites can provide a reliable basis for
              interpreting the developement of paleosoils.  3) Temperatures inferred for the
              fossil floras provide a basis for estimating elevation.  4)  Rates of
              evoluation of woody plants and of mammals during the period 10-5 Ma.  5) 
              Influence of taphonomy on floral composition at diverse sites (i.e., lake,
              floodplain, volcanic mudfow).  6)  And as a resource, the species of each flora
              are entered into the data base in Mus.  Paleo. UC Berkeley and are available
              via Internet.
