Abstract    :
              9417474  Thompson  There are a number of important national programs and a 
              variety of industrial application today that require the use  or monitoring of
              radiation in the ultraviolet and even  shorter wavelengths.  The need for  high
              accuracy radiometry  in this region of the spectrum is becoming increasingly 
              urgent.  In response to this, a workshop  with multiagency  co-sponsorship will
              address measurement, instrumentation,  and standards necessary for absolute
              measurements of  irradiance and radiance.   The goals of  the workshop will  be
              to identify the needs of the UV measurement communities,  to compile a list of
              specific recommendations to improve the  nations UV measurement capabilities,
              and to determine  agencies' role in supporting these efforts.  In addition, 
              the workshop will showcase the measurement needs for  biological UV-B effects
              and for long-term solar UV-B  monitoring.  The proceeding of the workshop will
              be  published as a National Institute of Standards and  Technology  Special
              Publication.  ***
