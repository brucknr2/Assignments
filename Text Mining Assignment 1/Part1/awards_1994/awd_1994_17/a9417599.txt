Abstract    :
              9417599  Katz  Mirror symmetry, since its discovery about five years ago, has 
              been under intense investigation by both physicists and  mathematics.  From the
              viewpoint of physics, mirror symmetry  provides a powerful computational tool
              for extracting the  properties of a broad class of string compactifications; it
              has  also led to arguments establishing that there are physical  processes in
              string theory resulting in unusual developments such  as space-time topology
              change.  From the viewpoint of  mathematics, mirror symmetry uncovers a
              hitherto unknown  structure in algebraic geometry which shows a deep connection
               between a priori distinct algebraic varieties through their  common conformal
              field theory.  This physical connection, among  other things, allows for the
              calculation of various topological  properties which have proven intractable
              using more standard  mathematical methods.  recent research in mirror symmetry
              has  underscored the unusual degree to which it serves as an arena  where
              physical and mathematical methods can be harmoniously  united to produce
              important results for both fields of study.  The Mirror Symmetry Workshop will
              be held at Oklahoma State  University February 9-12, 1995.  The efficacy of
              this workshop  will be augmented by its taking place during a Special Year in 
              Algebraic Geometry which will be held at Oklahoma State  University during the
              1994-95 academic year with partial support  from the Division of Mathematical
              Sciences of the National  Science Foundation.  ***
