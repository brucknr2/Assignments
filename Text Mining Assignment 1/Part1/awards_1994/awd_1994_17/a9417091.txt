Abstract    :
              9417091  Jeffries    This award supports a two-year cooperative research project
              led by  Dr. Stuart Jeffries of the Bartol Research Institute and Professor Yoji
               Osaki of the University of Tokyo. The collaborators will study the 
              composition and dynamics of the Sun s interior and atmosphere  through
              measurement of its acoustic oscillations (helioseismology.)      The
              collaboration is a natural combination of expertise: the U.S. team  has
              obtained some of the highest quality, imaged, helioseismic data  currently
              available whereas the Japanese researchers are theoreticians  in solar
              oscillations.  By combining these expertises, the two groups  can achieve a
              deeper understanding and more rapid progress than can  either group alone. 
              Therefore, this proposal fulfills the objectives of  the Program in its
              exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge  through an international
              collaboration.  ***
