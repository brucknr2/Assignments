Abstract    :
              9417001  Sadee    This award supports a three-year cooperative research project
              between  Dr. Wolfgang Sadee, School of Pharmacy, University of California,  San
              Francisco and Professor Tatsuya Haga  of Tokyo University.  The  first
              objective of this joint proposal is to identify those receptor  domains
              responsible for activating the receptor kinases to initiate  phosphorylation. 
              The second objective focuses on the role of  phosphorylation in protein
              coupling and cellular trafficking.  The  results are expected to reveal diverse
              effects of phosphorylation  including desensitization of signal transduction.  
               This proposal brings together research scientists from two countries  working
              in the area of neuron function.  Dr. Sadee and his graduate  students will have
              the opportunity to become familiar with research  techniques and practices at
              Tokyo University.  Therefore, this  proposal fulfills the objectives of the
              Program in its exchange and  transfer of scientific knowledge through an
              international collaboration.  ***
