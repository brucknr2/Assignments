Abstract    :
              Zuckerman  9417158  This research involves observational study and theoretical
              analysis of the gas that might accompany circumstellar disks of dust. 
              Sensitive studies of gas orbiting young stars of known age could provide
              important constraints for theories of solar system formation, in particular
              time scales involved for the building of Jupiter-like planets from residual
              interplanetary gas.  Jupiter and Saturn likely formed from such gas durine the
              time that it was retained in the solar nebula, typically up to about 10 million
              years.  The primary objective of the study is to use the largest and most
              sensitive millimeter wavelength radio telescopes to measure the mass of gaseous
              material that orbits stars with ages between one and ten million years, when
              giant planet formation is predicted.  Very recently, identification of a sample
              of stars with likely ages in the critical time interval have been identified
              and the IRAM 30-m radio telescope has detected molecular gas orbiting many of
              these stars.  In this regard millimeter wavelength molecular spectroscopy is an
              especially valuable tool since, in addition to a measure of gas mass, it
              provides a diagnostic of disk kinematics and chemistry.  The age of a young
              target star may be estimated in a variety of ways including, for example, its
              location in the sky relative to dusty molecular clouds, its luminosity relative
              to main sequence stars of the same temperature, and the strength of certain key
              lines in its optical spectrum.  Concerning the latter, the proposed research
              includes measurements of optical lines of lithium, calcium, and hydrogen atoms
              using high resolution eschelle spectrographs.   ***
