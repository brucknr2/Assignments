Abstract    :
              9417921  Onstott   This award provides partial (52%) funding for the purchase of
              equipment components to upgrade a Nd-YAG laser system installed and operated in
              the Department of Geological and Geophysical Sciences at Princeton University.
              The institution is committed to providing the remaining funds necessary to
              carry out the project. The upgrade will allow the laser, which normally emits
              radiation in the infra-red range to quadruple its frequency into the
              ultraviolet range. The upgrade will improve the performance of the laser in
              applications where it is used as a microprobe sampling device for argon-argon
              dating of minerals.  ***
