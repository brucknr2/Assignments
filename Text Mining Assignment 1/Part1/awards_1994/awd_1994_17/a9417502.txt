Abstract    :
                9417502  Nurmikko    This poject concentrates on research in which high speed
              optical  and optoelectronic techniques are applied to the study of lower 
              dimensional electronic excitations in small heterostructures in  compound
              semiconductors.  In particular, new terahertz transient  spectroscopic methods
              will be applied to the study of few and many  electron systems in quantum wires
              and dots in quantizing magnetic  fields, with emphasis on the ballistic and
              coherent response.   Enhanced spatial resolution in high amplitude THz fields
              will be  provided by near field imaging methods.    % % %    This project aims
              at the study of electrom motion in small  semiconductor structures, on a scale
              much smaller than a  micrometer.  The electrons may be confined along a very
              thin wire  or in a box, this will make them behave more as waves rather than 
              particles.  Ultrashort laser pulse techniques are applied to  provide an
              initial impact of excitation of the electrons and to  follow their subsequent
              motion on a timescale of about one  trillionth of a second.  In particular, a
              novel spectroscopic  arrangement that uses so-called terahertz techniques will
              be  employed.  ***
