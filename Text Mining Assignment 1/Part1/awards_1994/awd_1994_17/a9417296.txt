Abstract    :
              9417296  Ogelman       The observations of radio pulsars and accreting neutron 
              stars yield information on the dynamics and structure of  neutron stars.  The
              aim of this proposal is to learn about  neutron star structure from
              observations pertaining to  neutron star dynamics.       A dynamical model for
              radio pulsar glitches, developed  by the PI and collaborators, will be used for
              fitting the  glitches and postglitch timing data.       An evolutionary
              picture, with young and older pulsars  exhibiting different glitch behavior,
              will be explored,  along with a statistical study of the distribution of glitch
               sizes and interglitch intervals.       The radiation of the energy dissipated
              by internal  torgues will be searched for in X-ray observations of radio 
              pulsars.       A comparative study of luminosity power spectra from  different
              types of accreting neutron stars as well as timing  noise from accretion
              powered pulsars will be attempted.  ***
