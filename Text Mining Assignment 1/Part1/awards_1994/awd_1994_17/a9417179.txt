Abstract    :
                9417179  Van Hove    This award supports a two-year cooperative research
              project between  Dr. Michel Van Hove of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and 
              Professor Hiroshi Tochihara of  Hokkaido University. The  collaborators will
              conduct research on atomic-scale surface structures  of ordered surface alloys
              obtained by depositing alkali metals on  transition and noble metals.  These
              surface materials are of  considerable interest in such important technologies
              as catalysis and  magnetic superlattice properties.  The main technique to be
              used will  be low energy electron diffraction (LEED.)    The sample
              preparations and LEED intensity measurements will be  carried out at Hokkaido
              University in the laboratory of Professor  Tochihara who is particularly
              well-experienced with complex alkali  metal adsorption structures.  The
              structural analysis of the measured  data will be performed by Dr. Van Hove in
              Berkeley.  By combining  these expertises, the two groups can achieve a deeper
              understanding  and more rapid progress than can either group alone.  Therefore,
              this  proposal fulfills the objectives of the Program in its exchange and 
              transfer of scientific knowledge through an international collaboration.  ***
