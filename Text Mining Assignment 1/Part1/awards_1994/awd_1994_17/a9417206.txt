Abstract    :
              9417206  Durand    Description: This project supports cooperation  between Dr.
              Dominique Durand, Biomedical  Engineering Department at Case Western Reserve 
              University in Cleveland, OH, and Dr. Bassel  Tawfik, Biomedical Engineering
              Department at  Cairo University in Egypt.  The project deals  with a new method
              for parameter estimation,  especially in the environment of biological 
              systems.  The method, which utilizes Linear  Associative Memories (LAM) has
              been applied to  the estimation of electronic parameters of  nerve cells.  The
              initial results indicate that  parameter estimates for a neural estimation 
              problems obtained by LAM, always fall within  the neighborhood of the "true"
              solution.  The  objectives of this project are: to assess the  degree of
              immunity of the LAM methods to the  problem of local minima; to develop the
              method  further by first using a recursive algorithm to  improve its range; to
              add non-linear terms to  improve the accuracy; and finally to apply this 
              technique to the estimation of neuronal  parameters of granule cells in the
              hippocampus  using data collected in Dr. Durand laboratory.    Scope:  This
              project will allow a cooperative  activity between the two investigators and 
              their respective departments where data  collection will be done at CWRU while
              data  analysis will be performed at Cairo University,  and where the final
              examination and evaluation  of the results will be the mutual  responsibility
              of the two principal  investigators.  The project meets the criteria  of the
              Division of International Programs well.  ***
