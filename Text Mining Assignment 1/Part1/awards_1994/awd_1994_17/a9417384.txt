Abstract    :
                A new method for image description, compression, and  manipulation  based on
              finite automata is studied.  A Weighted Finite Automaton  (WFA) computes a real
              function on  0,1, .., n. For n = 2, such a  function can be  interpreted as the
              grayscale function specifying  an image.  The most important  application of
              WFA is the new image-  compression method based on the WFA  inference
              algorithm. This  method can be classified as a fractal compression  method, but
              it  is different and performs considerably better than the previous  fractal
              methods for image compression. It produces an excellent  compression  size to
              quality ratio for the widest variety of  images.  The current  image-data
              compression software performs well;  however, it does not reach the  full
              potential of WFA for image  compression.  One of the main goals of this 
              project is to  optimize the compression algorithm to make it faster and to 
              produce better quality regenerated images for the same  compression rate. 
              Weighted Finite Transducers (WFT) are a tool for the description  and 
              implementation of image transformations. The project will  investigate the WFT 
              and their applications, their efficient  implementation, and the design of 
              inference algorithms for WFT.
