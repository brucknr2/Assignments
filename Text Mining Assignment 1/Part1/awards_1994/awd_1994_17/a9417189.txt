Abstract    :
              9417189  Barger    This award supports a three-year cooperative research project
              between  Dr. Vernon Barger of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and 
              Professor Tsutomu Yanagida of  Tohoku University. The  collaborators assembled
              also include phenomenologists from the  University of Pennsylvania and the
              University of Hawaii as well as  theorists from Nagoya University and the
              National Laboratory for  High Energy Physics (KEK).   This project will address
              some of the  most important areas of research in the phenomenology of 
              fundamental particle interactions. This collaboration will facilitate in- 
              depth studies of the phenomenology of physics beyond the Standard  Model on the
              following topics: physics at linear e+e- colliders;  supersymmetry; strong WW
              scattering; astrophysics; and B physics.    This proposal brings together
              research scientists from two countries  working in the area of theoretical
              physics.  The U.S. scientists will  have the opportunity to become familiar
              with research techniques and  equipment at Tohoku University and KEK. 
              Therefore, this proposal  fulfills the objectives of the Program in its
              exchange and transfer of  scientific knowledge through an international
              collaboration.  ***
