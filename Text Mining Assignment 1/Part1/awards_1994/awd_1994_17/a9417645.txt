Abstract    :
              Gurnis  9417645  The time has come to more fully understand the flow and
              rheology of slabs from initial descent of the oceanic   lithosphere as it
              slides by the over-riding plate down through its complex passage into the
              mantle transition   zone.  This will require that a new generation of dynamic
              models be simultaneously tested against both   observations at intermediate
              scales (10-100 km) and at larger scales (100-100000km).  This lime of research
              has   been made possible by recent incorporation of faults between subducted
              and over-riding plates in dynamic slab   models.  When faults are incorporated
              between plates, oceanic trenches naturally arise and the essential trends of  
              all relevant observations are reproducible.  ****
