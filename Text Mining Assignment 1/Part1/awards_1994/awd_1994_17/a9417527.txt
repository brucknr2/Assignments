Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9417527  L. Collins    It is  proposed a Direct Numerical
              Simulation (DNS) method to analyze the effect of turbulence on the aerosol
              formation and coagulation of titanium dioxide pigment particles.  Quantitative
              predictions of the rate of nucleation, particle collisions, growth rates, and
              the final particle size distribution will be obtained by calculating the
              coherent turbulent structure and using microstructural aspects of the two-phase
              flow system.  The computational results will be compared to the experiments
              performed at the DuPont Co.     The proposed method, if successful, will open a
              new approach to understand and predict the turbulent flow aerosol reactors,
              with application to advance materials.  ***
