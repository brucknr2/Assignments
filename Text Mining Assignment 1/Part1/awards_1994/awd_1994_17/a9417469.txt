Abstract    :
              9417469  Safari    The primary objective of this research is to study the
              effects of  grain size on the phase transitions and dielectric properties of 
              important dielectric and electrostrictive materials including:  barium
              titanate, lead titanate, and lead magnesium niobate.  The  research is being
              performed jointly between the  Industry/University Cooperative Research Center
              for  Microengineered Ceramics at the University of New Mexico and the 
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Ceramics at  Rutgers
              University.  Precursor powders, with controlled  microstructures and chemical
              purity and nanosized dimensions, are  being produced via a novel aerosol
              decomposition process at the  University of New Mexico.  The powders are
              characterized using  spectroscopy, microscopy, and surface area techniques.  
              Processing techniques being employed include dry pressing,  hot  isostatic
              pressing, and doctor blade tape casting.  Densification  behavior will be
              studied using dilatometry.   The dielectric  properties are being characterized
              also.    This joint effort is a natural collaboration , as it utilizes the 
              strengths of each institution, and results in more than the sum  of the output
              for each working separately.  The research is very  timely for the electronic
              ceramics industry.  The results of this  research will be of use to
              manufacturers of thin film multilayer  electrostatic/piezoelectric devices.   
              The Program Manager recommends Rutgers University be awarded  $75,000 for 36
              months through a "TIE" project with the University  of New Mexico.
