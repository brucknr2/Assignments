Abstract    :
              9417882  Crumbly       This proposal addresses a critical problem in the
              geosciences,  the problem of under-represented minorities in the goesciences
              and  especially as students.  A major difficulty in attracting talented, 
              science-oriented minority students to the geosciences is that,  while the
              historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) have  had the best track
              record in educating Black scientists, few HBCUs  have geoscience departments. 
              This proposal capitalizes on the  successes and the networks of HBCUs and
              creatively addresses the  problem of how to train these young scientists in
              geology and  geophysics by giving them solid backgrounds at an HBCU in
              chemistry  or mathematics (either of which will stand students in very good 
              stead in careers in geoscience) and intensive geoscience training  at a major
              university.  The approach also has the potential for  creating a critical mass
              of Black students studying geology at one  institution, something that
              individual institutions find virtually  impossible to accomplish.
