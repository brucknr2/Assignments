Abstract    :
              Woosley, Stanford  9417161  Woosley and his group will continue theoretical
              studies of stellar evolution, supernovae and nucleosynthesis.  They plan to
              improve the physics in their computer models for stars more massive than eight
              solar-masses, to continue their efforts to find the prototypical theoretical
              counterparts for supernovae of various types (SN 1993J,for example), to build
              more realistic multidimensional computer models of the supernova explosion
              itself for massive stars and white dwarfs, and to explore the entire range of
              isotopic nucleosynthesis created in these events.  ***
