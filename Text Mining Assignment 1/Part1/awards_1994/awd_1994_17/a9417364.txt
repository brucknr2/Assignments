Abstract    :
              9417364  Middleton  This award will support and maintain the negative-ion source
               and AMS development program at the University of  Pennsylvania for a period of
              three years.  The principal  objective of the program are:  (1) to extend the
              present  studies of polyatomic and molecular ions that are currently  underway
              with carbon and aluminum.  In particular, to search  for new double-negative
              clusters, utilizing the methods  developed to detect and veridy double-negative
              clusters of  carbon by acceleration in the tandem Van de Graaff  accelerator. 
              (2) to revise, expand, and prepare the  Negative Ion Cookbook for formal
              publication.  Much new data  would be included on polyatomic and molecular ions
              and on  the negative-ion signatures of some common compounds and  minerals. 
              (3) Continue to develop the triode source that is  expected to produce an order
              of magnitude more current than  the present high-intensity source. The
              availability of such  a source will have impact in several fields including 
              nuclear science where it should enable higher intensity  relativistic heavy-ion
              beams to be accelerated in RHIC.  (4)  develop new techniques for accelerator
              mass spectroscopy  (AMS). ***
