Abstract    :
              9417979  Nabelek   This award will support a comprehensive geochemical and
              petrologic study of the generation of peraluminous leucogranites with focus on
              the Precambrian terrane in the Black Hills, South Dakota.  Because petrological
              and geochemical relationships in the area are similar to other peraluminous
              leucogranite suires worldwide, the results from the study will result in a
              better understanding of perlauminous granite generation in general.  The
              analytical work will include SEM and X-ray image analysis of the distribution
              of accessory phases, analysis of whole rocks and mineral separates for major
              and trace elements, analysis of minerals by electron microprobe, oxygen isotope
              analyses of whole rocks and minerals and possibly ICP-MS analysis of fluid
              inclusions.  The data will be interpreted in view of published experimental
              studies of granite generation and theory of trace elements and isotopic
              behavior during crustal melting.
