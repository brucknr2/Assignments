Abstract    :
                9417368  Tomasko    The PI and his collaborators propose to continue with
              their study  of aerosols and cloud structures in the atmospheres of Titan, 
              Saturn, and Uranus.  The objective is to determine the optical  properties of
              those three planetary bodies, the vertical and  horizontal distributions of the
              cloud and aerosol particles present  in their atmospheres, and the atmospheric
              microphysics.  The data  will be obtained through ground-based and HST
              observations.  From  the observations and modeling, the investigators expect to
              improve  our knowledge of the composition and chemistry of the bodies' 
              atmospheres; and of how cloud and aerosol particles interact with  solar and
              thermal radiation to modify the atmospheric heat balance,  affect the
              atmospheric dynamics, and control the scattering and  emission of solar and
              planetary radiation.    The proposed research is timely because of the
              plane-crossing of  Saturn's rings in 1995/96 (which virtually eliminates the
              usual  light pollution by the rings and which will not repeat until 2038);  it
              is broad because of its mutli-observatory data acquisition plan;  and, despite
              its focus on three rather different planetary bodies,  it has a unifying theme
              through its focus on the effects of cloud  and aerosol particles on atmospheric
              structure and evolution.
