Abstract    :
              Abstract   Wyoming Medical Center - R. Tobin   Connection to NSFNET  Proposal
              No. NCR-9417064  This proposal for connecting the Wyoming Medical Center to the
               Internet will be introducing Internet as a new information  service to
              participating hospitals.  As a valuable new service,  promotion, awareness, and
              training are critical components of  this project.  Training for WMC personnel
              will be accomplished by  formal instruction on Internet access and usage
              through  collaborative effort between Casper College and Wyoming Medical 
              Center's Information Services Department and health Sciences  Library.   
              Internet access will have a positive impact on patient care by  enhancing
              communication among healthcare providers and by  expanding access t
              health-related information via databases,  discussion lists, libraries and
              academic centers for physicians,  clinical staff and management personnel.     
              Internet access for participating Wyoming hospitals will reduce  the sense of
              professional isolation that exists in an area that  suffers from a shortage of
              health professionals.
