Abstract    :
                    This award to David Griffeath at the University of Wisconsin will  support
              the development of a user-friendly interface to the  Cellular Automaton Machine
              (CAM-8).  The CAM is a parallel  processing machine that was built to handle
              problems modeling  cellular automata.  Cellular automata are rules, usually 
              spatially local in nature, which give rise to interesting and  complex global
              spatial dynamics.  This interface will be  developed in conjunction with
              ecologists and will focus on models  of interest to them.  This Small Grant for
              Exploratory Research  will investigate the potential for the cellular automata
              in  modeling and understanding ecological processes with complex  spatial
              dynamics.
