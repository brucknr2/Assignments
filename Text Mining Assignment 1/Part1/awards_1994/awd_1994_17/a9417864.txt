Abstract    :
              9417864  Busse         The objective of this research is the numerical
              simulation of  fluid flows forced by buoyancy.  Through an analysis of symmetry
               breaking bifurcations, the transition from simple to complex flows  will be
              investigated as a function of both the Reynolds and  Rayleigh numbers.  These
              techniques should identify the structure  and evolution of flows with secondary
              and tertiary bifurcations for  useful meteorological examples.  ***
