Abstract    :
              9417855  Agee  This award will support experiments to determine the effect of
              pressure on the wetting of silicate and oxide grain boundaries by molten iron
              alloy.  dihedral angles of crystal-liquid interfaces will be measured on
              quenched run products to quantify grain boundary wetting and alloy melt
              connectivity.  The proposed starting material is the Homestead L5 ordinary
              chondrite.  Experiments will first be carried out using piston-cylinder
              techniques to establish the optimum conditions for achievement of textural
              equilibrium and to examine the effect of pressure in the 0.5 to 4 GPa range. 
              The second stage of the investigation will attempt to extend the work to higher
              pressures in a multi-anvil device.  The results of the proposed research will
              place important physical constraints on models for core extraction from
              chondritic mantle.
