Abstract    :
              9417523  Composto    The purpose of this U.S.-Czech research project between Dr.
               Russell Composto of the University of Pennsylvania and Dr. Petr  Vlcek of
              Czech Academy of Sciences' Institute of Macromolecular  Chemistry is to
              synthesize novel polymeric materials to study  polymer adsorption at the
              polymer/solid interface.  To do this,  the researchers will use anionic-living
              and group-transfer  polymerization techniques to prepare block copolymers and
              end-  functionalized polymers which bind to oxide surfaces.  These  specialty
              polymers will be blended with a matrix polymer and  spun-cast on an inorganic
              substrate.  The composition profile,  amount absorbed, grafting density of the
              adsorbed species, and  the strength of adsorption will be measured.  Results
              are  expected to contribute to our basic knowledge of polymer adhesion  and may
              have relevance to technological problems in the coatings  industry.    This
              project in materials research fulfills the program objective  of advancing
              scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the  United States and Eastern
              Europe to combine complementary talents  and share research resources in areas
              of strong mutual interest  and competence.
