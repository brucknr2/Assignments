Abstract    :
              9417097  Bernhard         Dissolved oxygen is deplaced to zero within the 
              biological zone of most marine sediments.  Benthic  foraminifera (Protista:
              Sarcodina), the most abundant  meiofaunal group in many marine sediments, are
              one of few  eukaryotic taxa which successfully inhabits anoxic  environments. 
              Unfortunately, little is known about the  physiological ecology of these
              foraminifera.  The broad  objective of this project to examine how certain 
              foraminifera, classically defined as aerobes, survive  episodes of anoxia and
              to determine their behavioral  response to anoxia.  Foraminiferal communities
              will be  studies from two types of sediments of the Southern  California Basin.
               Studies of the physiological ecology of  benthic foraminifera inhabiting
              anoxic environments are  significant to a variety of disciplines, including
              benthic  ecology, evolutionary biology, ecotoxicology, and  paleoceanography. 
              The fossil presence of facultative  anaerobic foraminifera in geologic deposits
              can indicate  where petroleum depostis exist, since oil source deposits 
              generally form during organic-enriched, anaerobic  conditions.
