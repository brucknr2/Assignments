Abstract    :
              9417513  Betts    This award supports the participation of eight U.S. scientists
              in a  U.S.-Japan seminar on Clustering Phenomena in Nuclear and  Mesoscopic
              Systems, to be held at the East-West Conference Center,  Honolulu from December
              14-16, 1995.  The co-organizers are Dr.  Russell Betts of the University of
              Illinois and Dr. Yasuhisa Abe of  Kyoto University. The seminar will explore
              recent advances in cluster  phenomena in nuclei and their connection to
              clustering in a more  general sense.  The current state of comparison between
              theory and  experiment will be covered in detail and the theoretical connection
               between multi-center shell models and the deformed, single-center  shell model
              will be examined.  The relationship between the physics  of clustering in
              nuclear systems to more general aspects of cluster and  molecular physics will
              be discussed to develop a wider understanding  of their common features.    The
              seminar will foster the type of contact between Japanese and U.S.  scientists
              that can be expected to have significant influence on the  future course of the
              field.  The proposed participants and observers  have been selected for their
              past contributions and current activity in  the field and the meeting can be
              expected to produce concrete plans  for future cooperation and exchange. 
              Therefore, this proposal fulfills  the objectives of the Program in its
              exchange and transfer of scientific  knowledge through an international
              collaboration.  ***
