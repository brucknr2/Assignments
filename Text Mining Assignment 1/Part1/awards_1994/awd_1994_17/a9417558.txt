Abstract    :
              9417558  Downer       A three year collaborative effort between US and FSU 
              scientists will explore a novel idea of creating a source  of extremely short
              coherent radiation tunable in the XUV  region.  The idea is based on the
              nonlinear properties of  rapidly ionized atoms to convert the spectrum of
              plasma-  driven laser radiation when the effects of high-order  harmonic
              generation spectral broadening and blueshifting can  be engaged and combined.
