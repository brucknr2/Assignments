Abstract    :
              9417560  Covington    This U.S.-Mexico Program award funds dissertation 
              enhancement research by Mr. Peter Z. Fule, under the  supervision of Dr. W.
              Covington of Northern Arizona  University. Their project is designed to
              determine the  effects of regimes of disturbance by frequent, low-intensity 
              fires on the structure of pine and pine-oak forests at a  site subject to
              recurring fires, representative of extensive  areas of forest land in the
              Sierra Madre Occidental Range of  northern Mexico. Work on this project will be
              carried out at  the La Michilia Biosphere Reserve in Durango, Mexico, with  the
              cooperation of Dr. Jorge Nocedal, Director of the  Reserve.        This project
              is important to both the U.S. and Mexico  because it will support the inclusion
              of disturbance as a  key ecological consideration in the management and 
              conservation plans for the forests of northern Mexico, and  it will provide a
              source of experimental data from an actual  "natural lab," useful in research,
              planning, and restoration  efforts for the fire-dependent forests of our west
              coast.  ***
