Abstract    :
              9417870  Nelson   This award provides partial (50%) funding for a technical
              support position at the isotope geochemistry laboratory in the Department of
              Geological Sciences at the University of Washington. The University is
              committed to providing the remaining funds required to support the position.
              The technician will be in charge of operation and maintenance of the isotope
              geochemistry laboratory which includes a modern thermal ionization source mass
              spectrometer and associated clean-rooms for sample preparation. The technician
              will also train and supervise students and visiting researchers to the
              laboratory. The analytical capabilities of the laboratory include measurement
              of uranium-lead ages and neodymium, strontium, and lead isotope and trace
              element characteristics of rocks and minerals for the purpose of interpreting
              the Earth's tectonic history.  ***
