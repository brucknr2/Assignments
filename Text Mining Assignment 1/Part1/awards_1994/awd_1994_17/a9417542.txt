Abstract    :
              9417542  Wysession    This research is to do seismological mapping of the
              core-mantle boundary.  This boundary is important for models of convection in
              the mantle and of heat transfer from the core.  This work will take advantage
              of essentially untapped sources of digital data to increase by an order of
              magnitude the number of direct observations of the core-mantle boundary.  A
              search will be done for digital waveform catalogs to extract and analyze the
              waveform sets of SKS-SKKS-SHdiff-SVdiff and PKP(DF)-Pdiff phases using a
              calculation of differential travel times involving reflectivity synthetic
              seismograms.  Differential travel times between diffracted and core phases
              eliminate most of the spurious source and receiver effects which are similar
              for both paths.  Current 3-D tomographic mantle velocity models will be used to
              help correct for differences between the degrees of heterogeneity, anomalous
              differences between the diverging diffracted and core phases in the mantle, and
              because the outer core is too fluid to maintain high degrees of heterogeneity,
              anomalous differences between the diffracted and core phase travel times will
              be interpreted as being due to heterogeneities in D".  Variations in the
              frequency amplitudes of the waveforms will also be analyzed to interpret the
              velocity structure of the lowermost mantle, as different D" velocity structures
              affect the SVdiff/SHdiffand SKKS/SKS ratios in different ways.  ***  ??
