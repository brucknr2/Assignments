Abstract    :
              9417637  Soldi  Measurement of polarization observables in low energy nucleon- 
              deuteron scattering will be carried out at the TUNL facility.  The central
              focus will be to study charge symmetry breaking in  the three-body system. 
              Theoretical work using Faddeev  calculations will be carried out in support of
              this experiment.  Studies relating to the extensions of these three-body 
              experiments to CEBAF energies will be carried out, specifically  working on
              field mapping the large magnetic spectrometers which  will be needed.  These
              activities will be carried out in  collaboration with personnel at TUNL and
              CEBAF.  ***
