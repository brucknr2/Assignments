Abstract    :
              9417854  Gidley     This proposal is a renewal request for, "Investigations of 
              Lepton Interactions".  The renewal request combines the previous  grant of the
              same name under Dr. Gidley with a grant for,  "Precision Positronium
              Measurements with Low Energy Positrons"  which was previously funded under the
              director of Dr. Paul  Zitzewitz of the Dearborn campus of the University of
              Michigan.  It is for studies of the properties of positronium atoms which  are
              formed by a combination of an electron with a positron.  It  calls for
              measurements of positronium lifetimes, energy levels  and the presence of
              violation of charge conjugation and parity.  ***
