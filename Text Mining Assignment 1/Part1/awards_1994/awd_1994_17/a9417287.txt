Abstract    :
              9417287  Squires  West Virginia Wesleyan College requests support from NSF for 
              connection of their campus networks to the midlevel network in  West Virginia,
              WVNET, and from their to SURAnet.  SURAnet is the  midlevel network located in
              the southeastern United States.  It  will provide operations management and
              information services and  it will give WV Wesleyan College a 56 thousand bits
              per second  connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per 
              second) National Backbone network.    The college has experienced a growth in
              auxiliary programs that  has added value to the basic mission that the college
              serves to  aid the education of all persons of all ages.  The networking  plan
              at WV Wesleyan College is the foundation for uniting all the  disciplines and
              campus groups.
