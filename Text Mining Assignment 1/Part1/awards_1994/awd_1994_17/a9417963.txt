Abstract    :
              9417963  Freidel    Rapid and extreme climatic fluctuations have occurred
              commonly  during the past 250 thousand years, although infrequently during  the
              Holocene.  Information regarding the mechanisms that controlled  past climatic
              fluctuations and the hydraulic response to such  events will aid in
              understanding possible future climate change.   This study will investigate the
              timing and climatic significance of  an oscillation in lake level of two
              paleolake sub-basins that  occurred during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition
              of Lake  Chewaucan, south-central Oregon.  Two hypotheses will be tested 
              concerning possible causes of the lake-level oscillation:  (1)  The 
              oscillation was caused by increased precipitation during a brief  period when
              the mean position of the jet stream core was located  over the study area, as
              it migrated north following the rapidly  melting Pleistocene ice sheets,
              sometime after 13,800 yrs B.P.  (radiocarbon years before present) but before
              11,000 yrs. B.P.  (2)  The oscillation was caused by cooler temperatures and
              increased  effective moisture associated with the Younger Dryas reversal in 
              deglaciation, after 11,000 yrs B.P. but before 10,000 yrs B.P.   Information to
              test these two hypotheses will be obtained by  excavating across a fan of
              sediment that was deposited along the  shore of one sub-basin lake when an
              adjacent sub-basin lake filled  and overflowed across the sill between the two
              Lakes.  Radiocarbon-  datable materials will be collected in the fan sediments,
              as well  as along the shorelines associated with the1 overflow in both sub- 
              basins.  This study is part of on-going research to investigate the  past
              climate of the Pacific Northwest during the Late Pleistocene  and Holocene, in
              order to learn more about the relationship between  climate, atmospheric
              circulation patterns, and surface hydrology  during a period of rapid climate
              change.
