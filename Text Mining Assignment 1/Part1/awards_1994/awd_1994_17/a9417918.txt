Abstract    :
              9417918  Morgan     This research is to seismically image the crust and upper
              mantle under Iceland to determine the shape of the basaltic melt source region.
               It will be a collaborative study with a large part of the effort supported by
              the National Environment Research Council of the UK, and participation of
              scientists from the Meteorological Office of Iceland, and the U.S. Geological
              Survey and Lawrence Livermore Laboratory in the U.S.  Portable seismic
              instrumentation from PASSCAL (35 stations) and the UK (10 stations) will be
              added to the 20 permanent Icelandic stations for 18 months to use local
              earthquakes and teleseisms to image the subsurface.  Possible correlation with
              data from European stations and U.S. Navy hydrophone arrays will extend the
              range of images.  The results should illuminate theories of hot spot structure
              and convection in the mantle which is a major driving force of plate tectonics.
