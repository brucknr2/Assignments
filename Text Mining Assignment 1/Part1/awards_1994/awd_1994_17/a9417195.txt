Abstract    :
              Mathieu  9417195    This is a two part project to study pre-main sequence
              binaries   with orbital periods of a few years or less.  The first is a high  
              precision radial velocity survey of about 400 of these stars   using the new
              Wisconsin-Indiana-Yale-NOAO (WIYN) 3.5m telescope   and multi-object
              spectrograph.  It is expected that about 50   binaries with periods of less
              than 1000 days, triple the present   number, will be found. The second is an
              enlargement of a previous   successful survey for submillimeter continuum
              emission from   protostellar disks associated with these binary stars using the
                new submillimeter array detector at the JC Maxwell Telescope.    The results
              will be accurate enough to resolve whether the   reduced continuum emission
              from 5-50 AU separation binaries,   those embedded in disks, are due to the
              binary formation   processes or from dynamical torques later clearing gaps in
              the   disks.  ***
