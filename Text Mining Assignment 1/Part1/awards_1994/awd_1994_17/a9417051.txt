Abstract    :
              9417051  Siddharthan  The objective of this study is to develop and validate
              seismic  design guidelines for mechanically stabilized earth (MSE) walls  based
              on their behavior in geotechnical centrifuge tests.  There  are currently no
              realistic guidelines available to predict the  behavior of mechanically
              stabilized earth walls under seismic  loading conditions.    The main goals of
              the study are:    (1)  to conduct centrifuge tests on at least five model 
              configurations with sinusoidal and  earthquake-like base excitations to gain
              insight into the  characteristic behavior of MSE walls,    (2)  to develop a
              simpler rigid-plastic analytical model to  predict permanent seismic
              displacement of MSE walls,    (3)  to validate the proposed numerical model
              using existing and  new centrifuge model  tests and finite element studies, and
                 (4)  to develop simple seismic design guidelines for MSE walls.    The
              centrifuge tests are conducted on the large geotechnical  centrifuge at the
              University of California - Davis.  ***
