Abstract    :
              Ripley  9417687  This pilot project will study processes involved in the
              development of hydrothermal flow systems associated with continental
              rift-related magmatism.  The project will emphasize stable and radiogenic
              isotopic studies of  volcanics and related hypabyssal rocks associated with the
              Duluth Complex in northeastern Minnesota.  Results will contribute to an
              understanding of possible origins of platinum group element mineralization in
              the Duluth complex, and will lead to a better understanding of crust-magma
              interaction in rifting environments.
