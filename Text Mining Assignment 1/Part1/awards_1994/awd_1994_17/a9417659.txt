Abstract    :
              9417659  Espinosa   The ECE Department of the University of Puerto Rico at
              Mayaguez has a tradition of producing highly qualified Computer Engineering
              graduates with the necessary skills, knowledge, and expertise to succeed in
              either graduate school of the industrial environment.  Involving undergraduates
              students in research as; increased their enthusiasm and interest in their
              studies, provided them with additional knowledge and experience, increased
              their employment opportunities, and motivated them towards graduate school.   
              Besides continuing this successful undergraduate research program, the major
              goal of this project is to develop the research environment needed to start a
              Ph.D. program in Computer Engineering and to increase minority participation in
              graduate school and research.  To maintain an excellent research environment
              and to accomplish the CISE II-MI program's goal of increasing minority
              participation the following activities are planned:     * to create a proposal,
              during the first two years, to establish a Ph.D. program in collaboration with 
                 the Math Departments of the Rio Piedras and Mayaguez Campuses:     *
              establish a plan to retain and increase minority participation; conduct
              research and establish a      productivity plan for researchers;     *
              establish a plan for faculty development;     * acquire new research equipment;
              and     * establish a Computer Engineering Center to administer and coordinate
              the proposed activities
