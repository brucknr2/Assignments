Abstract    :
              This award is for support  for a three year project to continue  an on-going
              study of time-dependent processes of Antarctic ice  sheet snow accumulation and
              transport dynamics, using a recently  developed system which automatically
              disperses colored glass  microspheres onto the snow surface at 14 day
              intervals.  The  microspheres act as both a time marker and tracer within the
              snow  profiles.  Currently, two units are deployed on the Ross Ice  Shelf near
              automatic weather stations.  After another year of  operation at the existing
              sites they will be moved and operated  for two years at an automatic weather
              station site influenced by  strong katabatic winds and an automatic geophysical
              observatory  facility on the polar plateau, where precipitation and wind-blown 
              snow characteristics are very different from coastal regions.  This research
              will combine experimental and modeling approaches  to try to understand the
              processes controlling snow accumulation  and wind-driven transport of snow.
