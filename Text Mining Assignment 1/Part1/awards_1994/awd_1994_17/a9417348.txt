Abstract    :
              9417348  Thorne    This award supports a two-year cooperative research project 
              between Dr. Kip Thorne of the California Institute of Technology  and Professor
              Takashi Nakamura of Kyoto University.  This  research is in support of the LIGO
              (Laser Interferometer  Gravitational-Wave Observatory) Project and of the
              corresponding  interferometric gravitational-wave-detection project in Japan:  
              theorists need to compute, from general relativity, the gravitational 
              waveforms produced by such binaries for use as templates in the  analysis of
              the interferometer data.        The Caltech group has great expertise in what
              types of calculations  need to be done and how to relate the results of those
              calculations  to the planned observations; Caltech also has moderate expertise
              in  the calculational techniques.  The Kyoto group has greater expertise  and
              experience than the Caltech group in two of the principal  calculational
              techniques: the theory of perturbations of massive  black holes, and numerical
              simulations of the final coalescence.   By combining these expertises, the two
              groups can achieve a  deeper understanding and more rapid progress than can
              either  group alone.  ***
