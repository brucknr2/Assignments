Abstract    :
              9417175  Wagner  The Medical Center Internet Connection project will expand and 
              integrate the existing network at the Lutheran Medical Center with  NSFNET and
              Internet.    This Internet connection will enable physicians, faculty, 
              researchers, librarieans, staff and students to collaborate with  colleagues
              within the Gundersen/Lutheran Health System and with  those at other Internet
              sites.  Patient care questions, diagnosis  inquiries and treatment plans can be
              electronically discussed.   Collaborative research can also be accomplished
              more readily with  an Internet connection.  The connection will facilitate
              access to  research resources for the 30 rural affiliates, including library 
              resources and National Library of Medicine databases.
