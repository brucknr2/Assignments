Abstract    :
              Iben  9417156  Stellar modeling calculations will be performed on a variety of
              phases   in the lifetimes of certain classes of stars.  These are well-observed
                cases which have not yet been modeled nor explained satisfactorily.    They
              include low-mass asymptotic giant branch stars, stars with 9 to 11   solar
              masses, white dwarfs in the late stages of stellar evolution,   symbiotic
              variable stars, cataclysmic variable stars, and mass transfer   in close white
              dwarf-helium star binaries.  ***
