Abstract    :
              9417499  Hillig    The Principal Investigator wanted to build a special furnace
              to  test out the conceived concept of the Reactive Vapor Infiltration  Process.
               Molybdnum Silicide materials are to be used as the matrix  materials and to be
              reinforced by fibers such as silicide as high  temperature composite materials.
               Molybdnum Silicide is to be made  from activities.  A rapid heating high
              temperature furnace which  can have controlled gaseous or vacuum environments
              and a working  temperature of 1800oC, is needed for the Reactive vapor 
              Infiltration Process.    %%%    The proposed work consisted of building a rapid
              heating furnace,  capable of reaching 1800oC and maintaining controlled gaseous
              or  vacuum environments.  It will be used to test out the concept of  reactive
              Vapor Infiltration Process can be very significant in many  important
              industrial developments.  ***
