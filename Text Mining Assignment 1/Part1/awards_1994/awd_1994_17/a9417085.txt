Abstract    :
              9417085  Pang    This award supports a three-year cooperative research project
              between  Dr. Jong-Shi Pang of the Johns Hopkins University and Professor  Masao
              Fukushima of the Nara Institute of Science and Technology.   The collaborators
              will investigate various iterative methods for  solving finite-dimensional
              variational inequalities and  complementarity problems that arise from
              engineering and science  applications and to gain a solid understanding of the
              relative strengths  and weaknesses of these methods.  Important issues
              pertaining to the  variational inequalities and complementarity problems that
              are deemed  relevant to the design, analysis, and implementation of the
              iterative  methods will also be studied.    This proposal brings together
              research scientists from two countries  working in the area of variational
              inequalities and complementarity  problems.  By joining forces and combining
              resources,  Drs. Pang and  Fukushima will solidify their research efforts,
              strengthen their  individual research programs, expand the scope of
              applications of the  results, and establish a solid base for further
              collaborations between  the two host institutions. Therefore, this proposal
              fulfills the  objectives of the Program in its exchange and transfer of
              scientific  knowledge through an international collaboration.  ***
