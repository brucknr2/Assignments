Abstract    :
              9417992  Engel  This project will focus on nucleation and growth on  silicon 
              substrates of ultrathin dielectric films, to include silicon  dioxide, silicon
              nitride, and silicon oxynitride, at  moderate to low temperatures using neutral
              reactants at  thermal and hyperthermal energies. Ultrathin oxides,  nitrides,
              and oxynitrides will be structurally characterized  at the atomic and molecular
              level using techniques that  include scanning tunneling microscopy, Auger
              electron  spectroscopy, and temperature programmed desorption.    %%%   
              Understanding the fundamental chemistry issues that control  reactive film
              growth of silicon oxide, silicon nitride, and  silicon oxynitride on silicon
              substrates of commercial  importance is a very high priority within the
              electronics  industry.  Requirements for ultrathin atomically abrupt gate 
              oxides of high uniformity demand a clear understanding of  nucleation and
              growth on an atomic and molecular level at  low temperatures, as well as
              knowledge about the thermally  induced stresses at the interface.  ***
