Abstract    :
              9417014  Stone       This is a proposal for 36 months of support from five 
              faculty at Syracuse University to investigate the physics of  b-quark and the
              c-quark with the CLEOIII collaboration at  the Cornell electron-positron
              storage ring, CESR.  The group  has a long history of doing physics at CESR,
              participating  in both construction of the CLEO detector and the analysis. 
              They were leaders in the important analysis of b-> sy  presented at the 27th
              International Conference on High  Energy Physics in Glasgow, they built the
              muon system for  CLEO and Prof. Stone was a leader in the development and 
              construction of the CsI calorimeter.  Most recently they  have been carrying
              out extensive tests on a RICH particle  identification device (PID) for
              installation into CLEOIII.  In the next three year period, in addition to
              continuing  their interest in the analysis, the Syracuse group will  build the
              PID and develop the data acquisition components  necessary to read the
              information from it.  ***
