Abstract    :
              Abstract   Program for Appropriate Technology in Health - Doug Palm   Connection
              to NSFNET  Proposal No. NCR-9417627  The Program for Appropriate Technology in
              Health (PATH) proposes  to connect the local area network in its headquarters
              in Seattle,  Washington to the NSFNET via a 56 thousands bits per second 
              router connection to NorthWestNet.  PATH also proposes acquiring  dial-in
              access to the NSFNET for its Washington, DC office.    Connection to the NSFNET
              will provide PATH staff with important  information resources which can be used
              to enhance program  activities, product development, proposal development, and
              grant  administration.  Program staff will also be able to use the  NSFNET for
              communications an file sharing between PATH offices,  with funders,
              international agencies, U.S. government offices,  and collaborators in North
              America,. Asia, Africa., Latin  America, and the Commonwealth of Independent
              States.    This Internet connection will enable researchers, librarians,  staff
              and students to collaborate with colleagues at other  Internet sites.  Patient
              care questions, diagnosis inquires and  treatment plans can be electronically
              discussed and collaborative  research can be accomplished more readily with an
              Internet  connection.
