Abstract    :
              9417649  Monson     Thermodynamic properties of a fluid adsorbed in a porous
              material are substantially modified by the confinement created by the geometry
              of the porous material.  This plays an important role in adsorption equilibrium
              for pure fluids and in selective adsorption from mixtures.  Theoretical studies
              of such phenomena have been mostly restricted to molecular models in which the
              porous material has a well defined and simply characterized geometry.  This
              proposal is concerned with what happens if the microstructure of the material
              is not so easily defined or characterized.  Such materials are the rule rather
              than the exception in practical applications ranging from adsorption
              separations to catalysis to the modeling of oil reservoirs.  The proposed work
              involves the further development of molecular models of disordered porous
              materials and studies of adsorption equilibrium using molecular simulation. 
              This will be accompanied by the development and application of cluster
              expansion, integral equation and mean field theories.  The nature of phase
              equilibrium in such systems will also be explored.  ***
