Abstract    :
              Recently-developed theoretical insights and numerical methods will  be used to
              generate and solve new mathematical models for  interpreting measured spatial
              and temporal distributions of waves  and associated particle velocity
              distributions in the magnetosphere  and heliosphere.  Emphasis will be on the
              evolution of beam-excited  waves, wave-accelerated particles, and beam
              relaxation, using  kinetic, fluid and hybrid models.  Innovative higher
              dimensional  two-time-scale fluid codes designed  to mimic linear and nonlinear
               kinetic effects will be developed and solved on the NCAR  supercomputers, with
              lower dimensional versions tested against  Vlasov codes.  In collaboration with
              experiments from the Berkeley  Space Sciences Laboratory, theoretical models
              will be constructed  and numerically analyzed, and the results compared with
              in-situ  rocket and satellite measurements  of electrons, ions, magnetized- 
              electron-plasma waves and lower-hybrid wave structures in the  magnetosphere. 
              Relevant magnetospheric wave and particle data will  come from the Alaska-88,
              Bidarca and Alaska-95 rockets, the  imminent Fast Explorer and satellite, the
              Swedish satellite Freja,  and the Cornell Topaz rocket campaigns.  We will
              construct and  numerically analyze closely related mathematical models, which 
              describe similar fundamental underlying processes common to beam-  driven
              Langmuir wave turbulence found in the electron foreshock of  Earth's bow shock
              and in the solar wind, during solar radio  emissions, and postulated as the
              source of the heliospheric  emission measured by Voyager 1 and 2.  Theoretical
              predictions will  be compared with high-time resolution data on particle 
              distributions and Langmuir waves in the electron foreshock and in  the solar
              wind expected from the WIND satellite, to be launched in  November of 1994.
