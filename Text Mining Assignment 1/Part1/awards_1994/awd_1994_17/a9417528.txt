              Abstract  ATM-9417528  McKeague, Ian W.  Florida State University  Title:   
              Empirically Determined Climate Predictability Using            Nonlinear Time
              Series Models    This grant is to apply various modern methods of nonlinear
              time  series analysis to look at the problem of climate predictability.  
              Observed and GCM simulated time series will be examined using the  tools of
              nonlinear dynamical systems theory to construct nonlinear  statistical models. 
              This will enable the PIs to assess the  predictability of climate.
