Abstract    :
              9417924  Sellin       This proposal calls for a study of the, "Interaction of 
              X-Rays, Vacuum UV, and Ions with Atoms, Ions and Surfaces".  It  is for the
              study of various physical processes which occur in  direct photoionization and
              in the related phenomena of electron  emission in grazing incidence collisions
              of ions with clean  surfaces.  It proposes to compare the rates for single and
              double  photoionization both experimentally and theoretically in He.  it 
              proposes to study the production of hollow atoms in Li and to  pursue work in
              collaboration with Japanese co-workers on merged  photon-ion beam experiments. 
              Finally experiments on electron  emission in grazing incidence ion-surface
              interactions will be  studied.  ***
