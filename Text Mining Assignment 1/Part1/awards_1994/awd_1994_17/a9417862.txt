Abstract    :
              9417862  Romanowicz    This research is to conduct two studies which address
              geophysically important questions pertaining to the very deep structure of the
              earth, the core-mantle boundary and inner core, using diffracted S waves on the
              core-mantle boundary on the one hand, and a combination of body-wave data and
              free-oscillation data sensitive to inner core structure, on the other.  The
              first is a systematic study of diffracted SV deep into the seismic shadow of
              the earth's core, especially at epicentral distances in excess of 107 degrees. 
              This analysis should provide a substantial and new contribution to the study of
              lateral heterogeneity at the core-mantle boundary, so important to the
              understanding of core and mantle geodynamics.  The second study addresses the
              important question of inner core anisotropy, and, more specifically the issue
              of reconciling PKP travel time and normal mode splitting data, both in terms of
              depth dependence of anisotropy and its proposed cylindrical symmetry around the
              earth's rotation axis.  This study is relevant to the question of the
              compositional and physical nature of the inner core, its dynamics as well as
              its relation with processes in the outer core.  ***  ??
