Abstract    :
              Abstract   University of Missouri-Columbia - J. Mitchell   Connection to NSFNET 
              Proposal No. NCR-9417227  The University of Missouri-Columbia Health Sciences
              Center (HSC)  requests support to provide Internet access to its outlying 
              health care facilities in the city of Fulton.  This access will  be provided by
              means of a high speed extension of the internal  backbone at the Center.  The
              Health Science Center network is in  turn connected to the Internet through the
              MU campus backbone, so  its extension to the remote facilities will provide
              users at  those sites access to the full array of both Internet and HSC 
              resources.    The Fulton location is especially significant for the HSC in that
               it will serve as a model for network communication to many other  remote sites
              in the future.  The satellite facility in Fayette,  described in this document,
              similar to the operation in Fulton  and would be the next location to be
              brought into the HSC  backbone network with the technology outlined in this
              proposal in  a phased approach.
