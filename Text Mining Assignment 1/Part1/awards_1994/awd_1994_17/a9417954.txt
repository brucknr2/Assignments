Abstract    :
              9417954  Wallin       The Klamath Mountains have been in their present position 
              since the Permian, however there is considerable controversy about  their
              origin in pre-permian times. Essentially, two hypothesis are  current - that
              theses lower Paleozoic rocks were part of a  microplate (Sonomia) that was
              accreted during Permo-Triassic time  or that the Paleozoic euqeoclinal rocks in
              California (Klamaths)  are tectonostragraphically equivalent to coeval rocks in
              Nevada.  This project will utilize the spatial distribution of the age range 
              of Zircons eroded from precambrian rocks along the pacific margin,  and the age
              range of detrital zircons in several formations in the  eastern Klamaths to
              discriminate between these models.  Additionally, the work is expected to
              elucidate the age, provenance  and tectonic significance of lower paleozoic
              siliclastic rocks  (Yreka terrane) in the eastern Klamaths.
