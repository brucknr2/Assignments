Abstract    :
              Abstract  SUNY Genesee Community College - K. Mead   Connection to NSFNET 
              Proposal No.  NCR-9417327  The Genesee Community College (SUNY) requests
              support from NSF for  connection of their campus networks to SUNYnet which is
              in turn the  gateway to the NSFNET.  SUNYnet will provide operations management
               and information services and it will give  Genesee Community  College a 56
              thousand bits per second connection to the NSFNET, a  high speed (1.5 - 45
              million bits per second) National Backbone  network.    The College needs
              greater functionality and network speed to be  able to access supercomputers,
              libraries, and make file transfers  along with being able to implement a more
              reliable mail system.   Students and faculty research will benefit from the
              link.  This is  also a unique opportunity for the schools to explore innovative
               educational resources.
