Abstract    :
                      9417699  Steckler    Predictions of ozone depletion rates in the
              atmosphere depend upon the calculation of reaction rates from a generated
              potential energy surface.  This computationally complex calculation is based on
              first principles, and is simplified by a technique called the variational
              transition state theory (VTST).  Even with these physical simplifications, ab
              initio calculations of a typical 4-5 atom system requires approximately 250
              hours of Cray C90 computer time (the most powerful American Vector Computer). 
              The crux of the first part of the project is the effort taking methods
              developed for vector multiprocessors and converting them to take advantage of
              new, massively parallel systems.  The resulting software (and the conversion
              techniques) should be of general interest to chemists for a variety of
              problems.  The second portion of the research will be the application of these
              newly developed codes to ozone depletion in the Antarctic.  The PI is currently
              a member of the staff of the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC), and has and
              appointment at the California State University -- San Diego (CSUSD).  Since the
              CSU system does not offer Ph.D degrees, the institution qualifies as a
              predominantly undergraduate institution, and much of the program is aimed at
              providing high performance computing environment at CSUSD chemistry
