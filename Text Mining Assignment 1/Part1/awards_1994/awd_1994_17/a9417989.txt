Abstract    :
              From 1990-1993, the Principal Investigator developed a theoretical framework
              examining African American women's gender roles.  This work was published and
              will be used to guide the analysis of secondary data acquired from the Center
              for Research on Women at Memphis State University, and from the Family Data
              Archives    The implications for the results of the data analyses are present
              for furthering theories about the development of African American and European
              American middle class managerial and professional women, adaptive strategies,
              and techniques for success that have only been discussed briefly in the
              literature.  The Principal Investigator's work in progress currently examines
              the gender role development among women in Latin America to determine the
              relationship between societal expectations and orientation and the impact on
              stress as it occurs within the work and family nexus.
