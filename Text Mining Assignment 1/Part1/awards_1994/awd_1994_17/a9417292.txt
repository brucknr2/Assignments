Abstract    :
              9417292  Sloan  Lander University requests support from NSF for connection of
              its  campus network to SunBelt Net.  SunBelt Net is one of the midlevel 
              networks located in the state of South Carolina.  It will provide  operations
              management and information services and it will give  Lander University
              connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45  million bits per second)
              National Backbone network.    The university needs greater functionality and
              network speed to be  able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file
              transfers  along with being able to implement a more reliable mail system. 
              Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.  This is  also a
              unique opportunity for the school to explore innovative  educational resources.
