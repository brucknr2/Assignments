Abstract    :
              9417787  Anderson  The aims of the proposed research are:  (1) to develop and
              test a novel approach to assess the pre-eruptive gas content (especially CO2)
              of basaltic magmas through analysis of glass inclusions in phenocrysts and
              scoria glasses; (2) to apply the approach to Kilauean picrites and
              differentiated lavas in order to constrain the bulk CO2 contents of parental
              magmas, and to quantify gas loss during magma storage, transport, and eruption.
               This approach will allow estimation of pre-eruptive gas contents and bulk CO2
              in many magmas, including ones for which gas monitoring data is non-existent. 
              Reliable estimates of pre-eruptive magmatic gas would be conceptually important
              for understanding magma dynamics, volcano evolution, relations between
              volcanoes and plutons, and volcanic emissions relevant to climate change and
              mass extinctions.
