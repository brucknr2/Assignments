Abstract    :
              9417514  Smalley   This award provides one-half the funding for the acquisition
              of two new Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers and the upgrading of two
              older generation receivers to modern specifications. The Principal Investigator
              and research colleagues at Memphis University's Center for Earthquake Research
              and Information participate in research projects which require the accurate
              geodetic positioning capabilities of state-of-the-art GPS receivers capable of
              baseline measurements with accuracy of better than a centimeter. Much of their
              research is aimed at understanding the accumulation of strain in the Earth's
              crust and the subsequent strain energy release by earthquakes.  ***
