Abstract    :
              Blum  The molecular motion of polymers at solid surfaces must certainly  play a
              critical role in the physical properties of materials used  in a variety of
              applications from advanced composites to electronic  devices.  Despite this
              critical dependence, little is known about  the molecular mobility in these
              very thin layers which can be on  the order of 10 to 100  ngstroms thick.  This
              is because these  layers are too thin for their mobility to be probed by
              conventional  techniques.  This Small Grant for Exploratory Research will 
              initiate studies to probe the interfacial mobility of homopolymers   adsorbed
              on solid surfaces.  Deuterium nuclear magnetic resonance  (NMR) spectroscopy
              will be used to probe the mobility of  specifically deuterated polymers. 
              Methyl-group deuterated  poly(vinyl acetate) and poly(methyl acrylate) will be
              used and  adsorbed on silica at differing amounts.  The deuterium NMR spectra 
              of the bulk and surface adsorbed materials will be used to  determine how the
              dynamics (molecular motion) of the adsorbed  polymers vary as a function as the
              distance from the surface  binding sites.  %%%  If successful, these
              exploratory studies will provide a unique view  of the dynamics of these
              interfacial materials and the results  should allow the development of
              composite materials with enhanced  performance.
