Abstract    :
              Abstract    This study will attempt to determine the contributions of natural 
              and anthropogenic sources to particulate matter less than ten  microns (PM10)
              aerosol at McMurdo Station during the austral  summer.  The natural sources are
              expected to include geological  dust, much of what may be resuspended by
              activities at the  station, seasalt aerosol, and marine-biogenic sulfate.  The 
              contribution of Mt. Erebus is expected to be small.  The  principal
              anthropogenic sources of PM10 are expected to be  combustion-elated emissions
              from six diesel generators, diesel  heat furnaces, and diesel- and
              gasoline-powered support vehicles.  The emissions from each of the major
              sources will be sampled and  their trace element, ion, and elemental and
              organic carbon  composition characterized.  Concentrations of the chemical 
              components will also be determined in 48-hour duration PM10  aerosol samples
              collected continuously for two months in each of  two consecutive summers in
              central McMurdo and at one upwind site  (8-Site). The individual source
              contributions to PM10 will be  determined by Chemical Mass Balance receptor
              modeling using the  ambient sample concentrations and the source composition 
              profiles.  The results of this study will provide guidance for  emission
              reduction strategies at this and other Antarctic  research stations.
