Abstract    :
              Cowley  9417013  The two nearest galaxies to the Milky Way are the small,
              irregular galaxies known as the Large and Small Magellanic clouds.  Unlike our
              own Galaxy, they contain little interstellar dust to dim the stars within them.
               By contrast much of the Milky Way is hidden from observation by thick bands of
              interstellar dust which lie along the plane of the Galaxy preventing
              observation of stars behind it.  Thus, the Magellanic Clouds are ideal
              laboratories in which to study the overall properties of various classes of
              stars.  Both of them contain numerous X-ray sources which are associated with
              highly evolved binary systems.  Study of these objects allows us to learn about
              the properties of stars which are nearing the end of their evolution.  These
              are unusual objects such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes.  The
              goal of this project is to study the X-ray sources in the Magellanic clouds to
              learn more about these end-stages of stellar evolution.  This project will
              combine the accurate positions for these stars obtained with the ROSAT X-ray
              satellite with optical photometry and spectroscopy of these same stars to
              measure their masses, sizes, temperatures, and other physical properties.  It
              is only in these rare binary systems that we have the opportunity to
              investigate directly the properties of degenerate stars and learn how they
              interact with their mutually orbiting companion stars.  ***
