Abstract    :
              9417938  Freedman    This award supports a planning visit for joint research
              between  Dr. Guoan Yue, Professor of Sociology (and Psychology) at Nankai 
              University, Tianjin, Peoples Republic of China, and a research  group headed by
              the Principal Investigator, Daniel Freedman, at  the University of Chicago.  It
              is a study of social attachment in  early childhood across two generations, and
              it uses current  observation (via videotape) and recollections via an interview
               and questionnaire.  It is a cross-cultural study in that  comparable data have
              been previously obtained from Icelanders,  Korean-Americans and
              Bengali-Americans.    The purpose of the study is to address the issue of
              cultural  relativity versus cultural universals with regard to mother-child 
              attachments.  The study will address a series of questions: Are  there
              recognizable, culture-specific patterns of mother-child  attachments?  Are
              cultural patterns of mother-child relationships  resistant to change across
              generations?  Are historically based  societal shifts sufficient to change such
              patterns?  If mother-  child relational patterns prove resistant to change, or
              if they  do not, which theoretical framework best accounts for the facts?
