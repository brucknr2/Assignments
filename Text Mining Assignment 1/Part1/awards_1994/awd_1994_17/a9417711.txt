Abstract    :
              9417711  Peacock       The geology and structure of many metamorphic core
              complexes  is reasonably well-known, however rates and duration of extension 
              and thermal effects, particularly in the upper plate, are not well- 
              constrained.  This project will utilize the well-characterized  Catalina
              metamorphic core complex to address these questions by  determining apatite and
              zircon fission-track ages and track length  distributions for samples collected
              from both the upper and lower  plates.  Results will help constrain the timing,
              duration and rate  of extension, the magnitude of crustal extension and thermal
              effect  of extension on the upper plate.  A rigorous thermal modeling  program
              will guide interpretation of the FT data and should  increase our understanding
              of the thermal evolution of the crust  during extension.
