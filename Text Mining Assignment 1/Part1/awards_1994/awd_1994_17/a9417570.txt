Abstract    :
                This project involves the pilot research of an anthropologist, and an
              economist in Indian villages in tropical Bolivia.   The project hypothesizes
              that the link between deforestation and village integration to markets is
              non-linear, peaking in villages partially integrated to markets, and that these
              villages deforest more because they face more tenure insecurity and higher
              private discount rates.  The researchers will spend 2.5 months in Bolivia in
              the summer of 1995 to collect background data on the Yuracare Indians, identify
              research sites, test the usefulness of diaries, recalls, and formal surveys in
              the villages, try to find price data in time series for Yuracare villages to
              measure the intensity of village integration to markets, test hypotheses
              qualitatively and refine them, get estimates on local costs of field work to
              prepare a budget for a longer study, assess the safety of doing field work, and
              explore the interest of local scholars, NGOs and government institutions in
              collaborating in more extensive research.  This research is important for the
              Human Dimension of Global Change research effort.  Advancing our understanding
              of the causes of deforestation on a household level will be valuable to natural
              resource policy makers as they attempt to design interventions to slow the rate
              of deforestation.
