Abstract    :
              9417005  Riser    This project is to analyze of a set of float data being
              collected  in the Western North Pacific.  Over the past couple of years, 98 
              floats were deployed at 1,000 and 3,000 m between 10 degrees and 40  degrees N,
              140 degrees E as part of the Kuroshio Extension Regional  (KERE) and World
              Ocean Circulation (WOCE) Experiments.  These  floats will be popping up to the
              surface in August 1994 through  July 1995.  The funds granted for this project
              are for tracking the  floats and processing the data.  The data analysis will
              include  combining the data with other WOCE data sets from the North Pacific 
              and model results to produce a synthesis of the state of the North  Pacific
              during the WOCE observing period.
