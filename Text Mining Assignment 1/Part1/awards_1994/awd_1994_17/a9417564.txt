Abstract    :
              The proposed work will be an observational program designed to  characterize
              upper thermospheric and exospheric conditions and  their temporal variability. 
              The fundamental objective is to  measure all important composition and dynamic
              parameters in the  upper reaches of the earth's atmosphere.  The PI will
              establish  techniques to determine thermospheric winds below and above the F- 
              region peak, the escape flux of atomic hydrogen and its thermal and 
              non-thermal partitioning, the velocity distributions of hydrogen  and helium,
              and the independent transport of light ions.  The  project's broader objective,
              besides driving observation and theory  to a unified description of upper
              atmospheric processes, is to  improve understanding of the evolution of
              planetary atmospheres.
