Abstract    :
              9417494  Wiens   This award provides one-half the funding needed for the
              acquisition of an erasable optical jukebox data storage system to be installed
              and operated in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Washington
              University in St. Louis. Washington University is committed to providing the
              remaining funds required for purchasing the equipment. The large volume mass
              data storage system is needed primarily for the research projects of the
              seismological research group in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences
              which are data-intensive and currently include  major field experiments
              involving deployment of  broad-band seismographs in the Southwest Pacific area
              (both island locations and ocean bottom locations) as well as in the
              continental United States for the study of deep Earth structures and earthquake
              sources.  ***
