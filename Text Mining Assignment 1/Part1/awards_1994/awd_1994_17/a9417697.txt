Abstract    :
              This award supports a US contribution to a collaborative project with Argentine 
              geologists and paleontologists to study late Cretaceous to early Tertiary
              marine  fossils in southern Patagonia.  The US contribution will focus on
              decapod  crustaceans (crabs).  Studies of Cretaceous an dTertiary decapod
              crustacean  faunas from several sites in the southern hemisphere has provided
              clear  evidence of faunal relationships between New Zealand and Antarctica, and
              less  well understood relationships between those faunas and the decapods of
              South  America.  Recent study of Paleocene decapods from La Pampa and R o Negro
               provinces, central Argentina, has suggested affinities of these organisms with
               tropical and subtropical Atlantic communities.  Thus, the biogeographic 
              boundaries between the Atlantic and southern circum-Pacific regions must lie 
              within southern Patagonia.    This award will allow the US investigators to
              join an Argentine field program that  is being planned to study Cretaceous and
              early Tertiary fossiliferous marine  rocks in remote regions of southwestern
              Patagonia.  This is a unique  opportunity to gather valuable information about
              the distribution of these crabs  in a remote region.  The objectives of this
              project are: 1) to collect, describe,a  nd classify the decapods crustaceans
              from Cretaceous and Tertiary exposures  in southern Patagonia; 2) to determine
              the implications of this fauna for the  paleobiogeographic evolution of the
              southern high latitudes; and 3) to assess  the significance of these organisms
              to our understanding of the origin and  evolution of modern decapods.  This
              work is important to creating a  paleoenvironmental framework for
              interpretation of the important Cretaceous  and Tertiary faunas from Seymour
              Island, Antarctica.
