Abstract    :
              9417307  Rai  This grant will provide partial support for 30 graduate students 
              and postdocs to attend the 11th International Conference on Ultra- 
              Relativistic Nucleus-Nucleus Collisions, Quark Matter '95 will be  held on
              January 9-13, 1995, at the Monterey Conference Center,  Monterey, CA.  This is
              a major conference in a new thrust area  for Nuclear Physics and about 400
              scientists are expected to  attend.  The conference will concentrate on recent
              results from  experiments at BNL and CERN, theoretical advances and future 
              plans for work at RHIC and LHC.  ***
