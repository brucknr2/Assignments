Abstract    :
              9417059  Wapner    This award supports the participation of twelve U.S.
              scientists in a  U.S.-Japan seminar on Optimizing Relationships Between 
              Environment and Behavior, to be held at Clark University in  Worcester,
              Massachusetts from August 8-9, 1995.  The co-organizers  are Dr. Seymour Wapner
              of Clark University and Professor Takashi  Takahashi of the University of
              Tokyo. The main purposes of this  seminar are to advance cross-cultural
              collaboration and to provide  new opportunities to plan future research that
              will serve to optimize  environment-behavior relationships in the 21st century.
               Topics to be  discussed include: environment-behavior relations for the 21st 
              century; general processes in environment-behavior relations; 
              environment-behavior relations in the city, in families, and in aging.    This
              meeting is the fourth in a series of U.S.-Japan seminars in this  field held
              over a period of 15 years.  Although a core of individuals  has provided
              continuity from meeting to meeting, participants in the  seminars have changed
              through the years to reflect an appropriate  pairing between U.S. and Japanese
              participants and the progress of the  research.  The U.S. participants provide
              a broad cross section of  expertise and geographical representation in the
              general area of  environmental psychology, and were selected on the basis of
              being  the most active researchers in the U.S. Therefore, this proposal
              fulfills  the objectives of the Program in its exchange and transfer of
              scientific  knowledge through an international collaboration.  ***
