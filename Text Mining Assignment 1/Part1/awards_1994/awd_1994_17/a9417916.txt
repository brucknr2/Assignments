Abstract    :
              9417916  Hake  Experiments suggest that the homeobox containing gene, kn1, is a
              reasonable candidate for a gene which influences meristem development in both
              maize and Arabidopsis. A variety of approaches will be taken in order to
              understand how kn1 functions. Additional loss-of-function mutants will be
              obtained. Excisions of the transposable element Ds from a Ds-induced dominant
              allele in corn will be analyzed and anti-sense phenotypes of the Arabidopsis
              homologue will be obtained. Two approaches for isolating potential downstream
              target genes will be taken. The Arabidopsis over expression phenotype will be
              used to isolate suppressors and to find enhancer trap lines whose expression
              patterns change in relation to ectopic expression of kn1 or its homologue.
              Concurrently, a subtractive library made from maize knotted leaves will be used
              to isolate clones that show increased expression in knotted leaves as compared
              to normal leaves. Those clones will be characterized and expression patterns
              determined.   %%%  Plant development occurs by the action of meristems, groups
              of self-renewing cells whose derivatives elaborate the organs of the mature
              plant. In order to understand how the meristem functions, it is important to
              identify genes that play a role in the meristem. The kn1 homeobox containing
              gene is a reasonable candidate for a gene which influences meristem development
              and a variety of experiments and approaches will be taken in order to
              understand how this gene functions.  ***
