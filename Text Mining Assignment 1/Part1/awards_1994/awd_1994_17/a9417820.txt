Abstract    :
              9417820  Devlin       This is a request for renewed support for a group of 6 
              faculty at Rutgers University to do research in two of the  most important
              experiments at the Fermi National Accelerator  Laboratory.  It is a combination
              of two groups both of which  have had NSF support.       Devlin, Watts and
              Conway are members of the CDF  collaboration exploring high PT physics adn
              heavy quark  production in antiproton-proton collisions at 1.8Gev.  This  a
              mature experiment and the Rutgers group developed,  provided and has maintained
              the level 3 trigger system - a  cluster of high speed workstations which
              processes the  output of the experiment in real time and makes the final  event
              selection.       Schnetzer, Thompson and Somalwar are key members of the  KTEV
              collaboration which is setting up the next generation  of experiments to
              explore CP violation in Kaon decays.  This  fixed target experiment is in the
              preparation phase and is  expected to run in early 1996.  The Rutgers group is 
              especially interested in rare kaon decays which are a by  product of CP
              experiment and whose observation may provide  clues about physics beyond the
              Standard Model.  ***
