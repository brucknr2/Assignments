Abstract    :
              Arnett, David   AST 94-17346  In massive stars neutrino cooling accelerates the
              last stages of evolution to the point that direct simulation of the
              hydrodynamics of convection is feasible with high performance computation.  The
              first multidimensional simulations of the late stages of the evolution of
              massive stars have just begun and will be systematically extended by this work.
               The hydrodynamic simulations will be continued to later times to provide a
              direct connection between observations of SN 1987A and other nearby
              corecollapse supernovae and what the star is actually doing.  ***
