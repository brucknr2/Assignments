Abstract    :
              9417833  Rashid    Description:   This project supports  participation of a U.S.
              delegation in an  International Seminar at the Bangladesh  University of
              Engineering and Technology (BUET)  in Dhaka.  The seminar will be devoted to
              the  topic "Comparative Evaluation of Flood Control  Approaches for Bangladesh
              and the Mississippi  Rivers".  The P.I., Dr. Salim Rashid of the  University of
              Illinois, Urbana, is also the  Vice President of the U.S.-based Bangladesh 
              Environment and Flood Committee in America  (BEFCA).  Dr. Rashid, with support
              from BEFCA,  will conduct the seminar with Dr. M. Mozzamel  Hoque, Professor
              and Director, Institute of  Flood Control and Drainage Research at the  BUET. 
              The seminar is scheduled for March 12th  to March 15th, 1995, and is expected
              to focus  on ways of comparing flood disasters in  developed  and developing
              countries, and of transferring  knowledge about disaster alleviation.  It will 
              particularly emphasize the aspects of the  socio-economic impacts of flood
              control.                              Scope:  This project meets objectives of
              the  Division of International Programs:  it  supports a joint seminar in an
              area of  importance to the U.S. and the collaborating  foreign country,
              Bangladesh.  The topics are  particularly important, in light of the recent 
              floods in the U.S., including the major  Missouri flooding in 1993 and the
              California  floods of 1995, and given the nearly perennial  flood problems in
              Bangladesh.  The  seminar  should lead to recommendations on research  areas in
              flood control policies and flood  damage mitigation procedures.  ***
