Abstract    :
              Abstract   University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences - John Roy   Connection
              to NSFNET  Proposal No. NCR-9417087  This proposal for connecting the
              University of Arkansas for  Medical Sciences to the Internet will facilitate
              rapid, cost-  effective access to the vast array of resources and services 
              available on the Internet for faculty and students at the  Arkansas Area Health
              Education Centers (AHEC).    It will enhance the research environment at the
              AHECs through  improved access to Internet resources, encourage faculty and 
              researcher interaction and collaboration, allow the sharing of  departmental
              information and disease databases, improve overall  communications
              capabilities, facilitate more effective evaluation  of program outcomes and
              strengthen the professional support  system for rural providers.
