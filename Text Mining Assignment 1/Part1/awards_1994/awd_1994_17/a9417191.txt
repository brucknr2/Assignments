Abstract    :
              Simon, Michal  9417191  In the nearby Taurus and Ophiuchus star forming regions,
              most of the stars are formed in multiple systems.  Binary formation appears to
              be the dominant mode of star formation.  The first goal of this research is to
              investigate whether this result is a peculiarity of either the class of young
              stars observed or of the star forming region.  Very large, new samples of X-Ray
              selected young stars in the Orion OB association and Corona Australis will be
              surveyed for multiplicity.  The second goal is to measure the most fundamental
              stellar parameter, the mass, in at least some of the young star binaries.  High
              resolution IR spectroscopy offers the possibility of identifying low mass
              companions that elude detection in the visible.  The third goal is to study the
              early evolution of binaries and their inner disks by angularly resolved IR
              spectroscopy.  ***
