Abstract    :
                9417111  Wooster    This award will provide funding for U.S. ocean scientists,
               particularly those in the academic research community, to  participate in the
              activities of the North Pacific Marine Science  Organization (PICES).  This
              organization was established in 1992 to  promote and coordinate marine
              scientific research in order to  advance knowledge of living marine resources,
              land-ocean and  atmosphere-ocean interactions, ecosystem components and
              processes,  resource usage, ocean response to global weather and climate 
              change, and human impacts in the North Pacific.  Participation by  U.S.
              scientists in Annual Meetings, as well as in sessional or  intercessional
              workshops, will be funded through this award.  In  addition, U.S. scientist
              participating in one of four standing  scientific committees (Biological
              Oceanography, Fishery Science,  Marine Environmental Quality, and Physical
              Oceanography and  Climate) will receive travel funding for required activities.
