Abstract    :
              9417258  Bonner  Russell Sage College requests support from NSF for connection
              of  its Sagenet Consortium Network to NYSERnet.  NYSERnet is the  midlevel
              network located in the state of New York.  Sagenet is  composed of Russell Sage
              College of Troy, Sage Junior College of  Albany, Sage Evening College, and Sage
              Graduate School.  NYSERnet  will provide operations management and information
              services and  it will give Russell Sage College a 56 thousand bits per second 
              connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per  second)
              National Backbone network.    The College needs greater functionality and
              network speed to be  able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file
              transfers  along with being able to implement a more reliable mail system. 
              Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.  This  is also a
              unique opportunity for the school to explore innovative  educational resources.
