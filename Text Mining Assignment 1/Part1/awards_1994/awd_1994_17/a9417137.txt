Abstract    :
              9417137  PERRY         This award is a renewal of an award to the National
              Academy  of Science to support the work of the National Research Council's 
              Board on Global Change (NRC/BGC).  Most of this award ($459,060)  provides
              funds to enable the NRC/BGC and other NRC committees and  boards to continue to
              provide assistance to agencies  participating with NSF in core functions of the
              NSTC Committee on  Environment and Natural Resources's Subcommittee on Global
              Change  Research (CENR/SGCR) in the development and evaluation of the  U.S.
              Global Change Research Program (US/GCRP).  Through this  additional funding,
              which was contributed by agencies  participating as members in the CENR/SGCR,
              the NRC/BGC and  related NRC boards and committees will continue to fulfill
              their  responsibilities in the following areas:       1.  Provision of advice
              to the CEES/SGCR on the U.S. Global  Change Research Program (US/GCRP);      
              2.  Provision of periodic reviews of the US/GCRP;       3.  Service as a
              liaison between the U.S. and other nations  in international planning efforts;
              and       4.  Establishment and operation of special ad hoc groups to  address
              issues of special concern regarding the US/GCRP.         In addition to
              continuing these core activities, an  additional $76,090 is made available to
              NAS through interagency  transfer of funds from NOAA and funds from NSF to
              support a  National Forum on Environment and Natural Resources R&D held in 
              late March 1994 at the request of the White House Office of  Science and
              Technology Policy.         Funds for these activities have been provided by
              NSF, the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National 
              Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the National Institute  for
              Environmental Health Statistics.
