Abstract    :
              9417446  Carter           This award provides funding to the NOAA Geosciences 
              Laboratory, Table Mountain, Boulder, Colorado for three years of  support of an
              absolute gravity measuring facility which will be  operated for the use of the
              academically based U.S. geophysics  research community.  The NOAA Geosciences
              Laboratory will house a  new absolute gravity meter system recently acquired by
              the  University of Colorado, periodically calibrate the instrument and  keep it
              in repair as needed, and provide field engineering  assistance to users of the
              facility during field deployments of the  instrument package.         The
              instrument will be  used primarily in basic and applied  studies of global sea
              level, mountain building, crustal  deformation, earthquakes, and the detection
              of underground movement  of water and magma.  ***
