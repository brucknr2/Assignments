Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry   Division,
              Prof. Gilbert Nathanson of the Chemistry Department of the   University of
              Wisconsin in Madison will continue his researches on the   interactions between
              gases and liquids, these ranging from repulsive   collisions to trapping and
              solvation.  Three sets of experiments will be   conducted:  1. paraffin,
              olefin, and aromatic liquids will be bombarded   by hydrocarbon gases in order
              to learn how changes in the structure and   bonding of liquid phase molecules
              govern surface corrugation and   gas-liquid energy transfer;  2. inert gas
              atoms will bombard the surfaces   of liquid metals indium and gallium and the
              In/Ga eutectic alloy to   examine the roles played by surface and sub-surface
              atoms in absorbing   the impact energy;  3. gaseous water, ammonia, short chain
              alcohols, and   hydrogen chloride will bombard a sulfuric acid surface to map
              out the   scattering from, and solvation in, sulfuric acid as function of
              impact   angle and collision energy.  Mass spectroscopy and time-of-flight  
              velocity analysis will be used to monitor the identity, translational   energy,
              and direction of scattered products.  There is little experimental work being
              done probing the liquid   interfaces at the molecular length scales.  This
              research has a high   probability of exposing new phenomena and discovering new
              aspects of   gas-surface interaction mechanisms.  The techniques employed in
              this   research were developed by the principal investigator.  The results of  
              this research will have bearing on other areas of physical chemistry such   as
              nucleation, vaporization,  chemical reactions at surfaces, polymer   physics,
              and atmospheric chemistry involving aerosol particles.
