Abstract    :
              9417168  Mitchell  Delta State University request support from NSF for
              connection of  their campus network to SURAnet.  SURAnet is the midlevel
              network  located in the southeastern United States.  It will provide 
              operations management and information services and it will give   Delta State
              University a 56 thousand bits per second connection  to the NSFNET, a high
              speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second)  National Backbone network.    The
              University needs greater functionality and network speed to  be able to access
              supercomputers, libraries, and make file  transfers along with being able to
              implement a more reliable mail  system. Students and faculty research will
              benefit from the link.   This is also a unique opportunity for the school to
              explore  innovative educational resources.
