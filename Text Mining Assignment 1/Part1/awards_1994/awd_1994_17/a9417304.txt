Abstract    :
              9417304  Xu        Large scale atmospheric systems such as low and high pressure
              centers are  typically governed by a balance of  pressure gradient and coriolis
              forces and are,  therefore, termed  balanced  flow.  For small-scale phenomena
              such as  thunderstorms, this balance typically does not hold and these weather
              features are  referred to as being governed by  unbalanced  flows.  The
              Principal Investigator will  perform a numerical and theoretical study of these
              two flow types.          Density current features, squall lines and mesoscale
              vortices are important  mesoscale weather producing systems and often persist
              over timescales longer than  individual convective storms.  These long-lived
              mesoscale structures may involve  different types of interactions between the
              balanced large scale flows and more  transient small scale motions.  Studying
              the related balanced dynamics versus  unbalanced dynamics may lead to a new
              understanding of why the concerned structure  is long-lived.  The balanced (or
              unbalanced transient) flow component in a mesoscale  convective system is
              likely to be controlled deterministically (or stochastically) by the  large
              scale environmental flow.  Identifying the balanced and unbalanced flow 
              components in mesoscale convective systems may provide useful information for 
              improving or developing cloud parameterization schemes for numerical weather or
               climate prediction models.    ***
