              Abstract  ATM-9417818  Wake, Cameron  University of New Hampshire  Title: Ice
              Core Records from Monsoon Asia    The highlands of central Asia possess a
              diversity of natural  archives from which detailed paleoclimatic records can be
              developed  (e.g., lake sediments, loess, tree rings, ice cores, glacier 
              fluctuations, geomorphologic features).  Despite this potential,  relatively
              little is known concerning climatic changes in the  region over time scales
              ranging from centuries to hundreds of  thousands of years.  The primary
              objective of this project is to  develop multi-variate, well-dated,
              high-resolution (annual)  paleoclimatic records for monsoon Asia for the last
              500 to >1000  years.  This project will focus on the chemical and physical 
              analysis of deep (approximately 200m) firn/ice cores recovered from  two high
              elevation (>6000m) glaciers in the Nepalese Himalaya.   Time-series developed
              from the physical and chemical analysis of  the ice core will form the basis of
              a regional paleoclimatic  record.  The proposed ice core research in monsoon
              Asia represents  a key component of the Himalayan Interdisciplinary
              Paleoclimate  Project (HIPP).  HIPP is aimed at improving our understanding of 
              the behavior of the Indian and Plateau monsoons over the past 2000  years,
              20,000 years, and beyond.  Multi-variate paleoclimatic  records from a wide
              variety of natural archives in the highlands of  Central Asia.  In addition,
              multivariate, high resolution ice core  records from the Himalayas will be
              compared directly with similar  detailed ice core data records recovered from
              Tibet, Peru,  Greenland and Antarctica, thereby developing a broader, more 
              globally comprehensive ice core data base from which to investigate  global
              change.
