Abstract    :
              9417768  Bethke    Developing a quantitative understanding of how rapidly
              groundwater migrates through the subsurface in sedimentary basins is
              fundamental to our ability to safely dispose of toxic and radioactive wastes as
              well as  to continued successful exploration for petroleum and metallic 
              resources.  Scientists estimate flow  rates using computer models based on
              physical laws of  flow and with geochemical methods based on the decay of
              radioactive or accumulation of radiogenic isotopes.   Surprisingly, the two
              independent approaches, both seemingly correct, give broadly differing results.
                This study aims to reconcile these discrepancies by using quantitative
              methods that  rigorously account for the many factors influencing the 
              distribution of isotopes in very old groundwater within sedimentary basins
