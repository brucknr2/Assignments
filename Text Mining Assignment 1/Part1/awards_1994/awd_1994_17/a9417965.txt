Abstract    :
              9417965  JEFFERY  This award will support travel costs, subsistence, and meeting
              registration for participants in a Conference on Development: Molecules,
              Mechanisms, and Phylogenetics that will be held at Bodega Marine Laboratory,
              University of California, Davis, in September 1995.  Plans include selecting
              eight young scientists (graduate or postgraduate students) whose attendance
              will be supported.  This is an exciting subject which integrates molecular
              phylogenetic systematic methods with the study of development.  %%%  Such
              comparative methods can be very important for understanding how developmental
              mechanisms have changed within major groups of organisms and contribute to this
              aspect of our understanding of the earth's biodiversity.  ***
