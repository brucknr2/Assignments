Abstract    :
              9417214  Zafiriou         To better understand the mineralization of dissolved 
              organic matter (DOM) this study will assess the CO cycle, a  key species in the
              marine organic carbon, by evaluating  independently its sources and sinks.   
              CO serves as a tracer for budgeting other substances in the  equation:         
                   1O2+aDOM+xhv--->dHOOH+eCO+fCO2+chv-DOM  (hv=photons, hv-DOM=light altered
              dissolved organic matter).    CO production and CO losses by microbial
              oxidation and gas  exchange in the mixed layer can be equated.  Thus mixed- 
              layer CO can be calibrated as a tracer in marine geochemical  units via its
              sinks, and in photochemical units via its  source.  Then determining the terms
              a-f in the equation  permits using their ratios to budget other photo-reactant 
              and photo-product terms.         Cruises constraining CO microbial oxidation,
              and  sampling for laboratory studies of a-f will cover varied  sites to allow
              generalizing globally.  Time-series studies  will be done in local coastal
              waters influenced by high-  latitude rivers, the N.Atlantic gyre where optical 
              properties driving photoprocesses vary seasonally (Bermuda)  and on CALCOFI
              transects in productive coastal (California)  waters.  A Seattle-Hobart cruise
              will add a large-scale  Pacific data set (NOAA/RITS).  CO gas exchange will be 
              estimated by traditional methods; CO microbial oxidation  will be measured in
              incubations as CO loss or conversion of  14CO2.
