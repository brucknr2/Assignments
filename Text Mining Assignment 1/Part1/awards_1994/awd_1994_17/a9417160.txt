              Abstract  ATM-9417160  Peteet, Dorothy  Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory  Title:
              High-Resolution Vegetation and Climate Records from the U.S.         Southeast;
              Glacial to Holocene Changes    This award supports a project designed to
              establish the patterns of  vegetation change across the U.S. southeast.  The
              timing, magnitude  and geographical extent of the vegetation response, in
              conjunction  with ice and ocean records, will help link mid-latitude and high- 
              latitude climate regimes.    Improved chronological control on a variety of
              paleoclimate records  has focused attention on the rapidity with which climate
              may  change.  This proposal will result in high-resolution  paleovegetation
              records from Virginia, North Carolina and Georgia,  encompassing an interval
              from approximately 18,000 to 9000 yrs BP.   These records, combined with those
              existing, will reveal if  vegetation responds unidirectionally across the
              region.  Climate  forcings will be identified and their potential to influence
              the  southeastern region will be evaluated with general circulation  model
              (GCM) simulations.  The GCM simulations will evaluate the  model's sensitivity
              to variations in solar insolation, ice sheet  extent and height, and sea
              surface temperatures (SSTs) in the North  Atlantic Ocean.  Data-model
              comparisons will point to future  directions of observational and model
              research.
