Abstract    :
              9417410  Boucot       The aim of this research is to increase biogeographic 
              refinement that will allow advances in understanding of  global biogeography,
              paleogeography and plate tectonic  relations for the relatively poorly
              constrained time  interval from the Middle Ordovician to the Middle Devonian. 
              Work involves preparation and study of a very large number  of samples already
              collected from diverse parts of the  world; included will be photography,
              identification, and  comparative analysis of brachiopod collections from
              Vietnam,  NW China, Iran, New York, Peru and Nova Scotia.  Work  includes
              collaboration with co-workers in the U.S. and Asia.  The project is part of a
              long term effort to compile a  survey of climatically sensitive sediment data
              for most of  the Phanerozoic, in order to delineate climatic  zones of  the
              past in more reliable detail.
