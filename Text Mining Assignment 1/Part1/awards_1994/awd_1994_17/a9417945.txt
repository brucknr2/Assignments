Abstract    :
              9417945  Navrotsky  This award will support high temperature calorimetry studies
               of the energetics of aluminosilicate melts, glasses,  crystals, and amorphous
              materials containing Ti, Zr, and La.  Emphasis will be on  measurements of heat
              capacities, heats  of formation, mixing, vitrification, fusion and phase 
              separation in situ at high temperature.  The goals are to  understand the role
              of high field strength cations in  affecting the energetic, structural, and
              physical properties  of crystals, melts and glasses, to link microscopic 
              structural features with macroscopic thermodynamics, and to  apply these
              findings to the behavior of magmatic and ceramic  systems.
