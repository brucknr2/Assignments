Abstract    :
              9417901  Reynolds       This project is an interdisciplinary study of the
              Cenozoic  evolution of the crust and lithosphere across the Colorado, 
              Plateau-Basin and Range boundary.  Lateral changes in crustal and  lithospheric
              thickness across this major tectonic boundary, and  their relationship to the
              extension of continental crust, will be  assessed.  Two transects will be
              studied by:  geologic mapping and  structural geology; sedimentological,
              stratigraphic and fission  track analysis; and volcanic, petrologic and
              geochemical analyses.   The results will provide insight into continental
              extensional  processes and will have direct relevance to many other extensional
               tectonic regimes elsewhere.
