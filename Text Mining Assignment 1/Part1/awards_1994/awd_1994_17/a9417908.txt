Abstract    :
              Johnson  9417908  The PIs will study how well various configurations of surface
              displacement measurements can constrain estimates of subsurface fault slip,
              with particular attention to the determination of coseismic fault motion.  With
              the burgeoning use of new techniques for surface displacement
              measurement-notably GPS and more recently SAR interferometry-an investment in
              how best to conduct these measurements in advance of anticipated earthquakes
              should pay off in a better understanding of the earthquake process and of earth
              structure models near these faults once the earthquakes occur.  ****
