Abstract    :
              9417724  Madison    This award will support the participation of ten U.S.
              scientists  to take part in a workshop in the area of Atomic, Molecular and 
              Optical (AMO) Physics.  The workshop will be held in Canberra,  Australia in
              mid-February 1995.  The American coordinator is   Prof. Donald H. Madison from
              the Department of Physics at the  University of Missouri - Rolla.  The
              Australian organizer is  Dr. Stephen J. Buckman from the Electron Physics Group
              at the  Australian National University in Canberra.  The workshop is  being
              conducted under the U.S.-Australia Cooperative Science  Program and support in
              Australia primarily is provided through  the Department of Industry, Science
              and Technology (DIST).    The workshop will bring together a wide diversity of
              expertise  from both countries for the purpose of discussing the current 
              status and future directions for research in the area of AMO  physics.  The
              expected outcome is the identification of important  problems that need to be
              solved and the formation of  collaborations which will address these problems. 
              Among the  topics to be considered at the workshop are the following: 
              Fundamental Scattering Processes, Laser Assisted Collisions and  Laser
              Spectroscopy, Cluster Spectroscopy and Collisions,  Photoelectron Spectroscopy
              and Surface/Solid Studies.  The   proceedings of the meeting will be published
              in a special issue  of the Australian Journal of Physics.
