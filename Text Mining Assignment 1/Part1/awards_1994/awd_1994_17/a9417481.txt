Abstract    :
              Loper  9417481  The proposed research consists of two related projects dealing
              with small-scale buoyant magnetostrophic flow in the Earth's core.  The first
              project has two complementary motivations: to understand better the relation
              between the observed secular variation and the dynamical state of the uppermost
              portion of the outer core and to investigate whether the presence of a rigid
              boundary can break the symmetry of the buoyancy-driven flow and generate
              helicity and an alpha effect.  The flow and field driven by a prescribed
              buoyancy distribution will be found by solving the linearized momentum and
              magnetic-diffusion equations in an oblique Caresian coordinate system using a
              double Fourier transform.  The second project will seek to determine the
              equilibrium shape and size of small-scale deformable buoyant parcels in the
              core, as well as their rise velocity.  The linearized momentum and
              magnetic-diffusion equation.  ****
