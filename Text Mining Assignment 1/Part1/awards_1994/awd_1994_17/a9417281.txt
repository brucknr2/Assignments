Abstract    :
              9417281  Yuen    This award supports a three-year cooperative research project
              between  Dr. David Yuen of the University of Minnesota and Professor Satoru 
              Honda of the University of Hiroshima.  The objective of this  cooperative
              research project is to study the dynamics and physical  properties of the
              transition zone of the earth s mantle by numerical  modeling and measurement of
              the creep properties of mantle minerals  characteristic of the transition zone.
               Research outcomes will enhance  our knowledge of solid-earth geophysics,
              high-performance  computing, advanced visualization techniques, experimental 
              techniques in rock deformation and multi-anvil cell technology.     This
              proposal brings together research scientists from two countries  working on
              mantle dynamics and convection.  The research problem  to be undertaken has
              many facets and cannot be undertaken  successfully by any one group.  By
              combining their expertises, the  two groups can achieve a deeper understanding
              and more rapid  progress than can either group alone.  Therefore, this proposal
              fulfills  the objectives of the Program in its exchange and transfer of
              scientific  knowledge through an international collaboration.  ***
