Abstract    :
              Baron, Edward  9417242  Baron will model the spectra and light-curves of both
              Type II and Type I supernovae.  He will calculate detailed models of both light
              curves and synthetic spectra of supernovae in order to compare with
              observations from the ultraviolet to the infrared in order to predict
              velocities, abundances, and distances to supernovae, as well as to constrain
              theoretical models for the explosion mechanism, progenitor system, and yield of
              radioactive Ni and Ti.  Baron has refined the expanding photosphere method into
              an accurate tool for determining calibration independent distances to
              supernovae.  His models give accurate values of the total emitted flux of
              supernova and thus should give accurate results for the Hubble constant.  ***
