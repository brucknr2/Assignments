              This investigator will use a whole-spectrum fluorescence system to study
              intracellular calcium-dependent cellular triggering.  When this is applied to
              the fluorescent probe Indo-1 it can detect simultaneous changes in
              intracellular calcium as well as a competing ion such as barium.  This system
              will be applied to the analysis of transients in intracellular calcium
              concentration particularly the calcium influx due to ligand activated calcium
              channels, which provide a second messenger in many nonexcitable cells.  The PI
              will set up a cell imaging and a single cell spectroscopy microscope.  In its
              single cell mode it will allow full spectra to be acquired with all wavelengths
              to be measured simultaneously via a solid state camera attached to the
              spectrometer. %%%  The use of a whole-spectrum fluorescence system, which can
              detect simultaneous changes in intracellular calcium as well as a competing
              ion, will permit the simultaneous study of the equilibrium of Indo-1 with two
              different cations.  A cell imaging and single cell spectroscopy microscope will
              be also be set up.  These techniques  will be used to correlate calcium
              oscillations with cell activation. ***                         ;
