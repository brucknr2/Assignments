Abstract    :
              Bruenn, Stephen  AST 94-17574  The main topic of this investigation is
              convection and its relation to the supernova explosion mechanism.  Other
              workers have identified three convective regimes: prompt postshock convection,
              neutron fingers, and larger macroconvection.  In each case the convective
              regime has been claimed to be crucial for the supernova explosion mechanism. 
              The PI and collaborators will continue to carefully evaluate each of these
              claims.  ***
