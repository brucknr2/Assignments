Abstract    :
              9417763  Haller    The special properties of single crystals (bulk and Layered 
              structures) with isotopically controlled composition will be  used in self and
              dopant diffusion studies.  Internal isotope  interfaces in superlattices of
              70Ge 74Ge with approximately  200 nanometer thick individual layers will be
              investigated  by Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy.  Materials with more 
              complicated diffusion processes will be studied in the  second phase.  Group
              II-VI direct bandgap zinc based  compounds and gallium nitride, blue light
              emitters, will be  doped with mono-isotope dopants.  They will be investigated 
              using local vibrational mode spectroscopy.  The  simplification in impurity
              spectra caused by isotope control  promises a new level of understanding of the
              local impurity  structure.  The results may lead to improved modeling of 
              devices with ever decreasing dimensions and increasing  complexity.  %%%  The
              end of the cold war has opened up the possibility of  obtaining large
              quantities of isotopically highly enriched  semiconductor materials from Russia
              and the Ukraine.  These  isotopically pure materials will be used to study
              atomic  diffusion in a completely new way.  Multilayers of different  isotopes
              of the same elements (e.g. germanium 70 and 74)  will be formed by thin film
              crystal growth.  Interdiffusion  at the interface will be investigated using
              Secondary Ion  Mass Spectroscopy.  After studying chemically pure isotope 
              structures, doped systems and mutlilayers of some new  semiconductors used in
              optoelectronics applications will be  studied.  The vibrational; spectra of a
              range of low mass  impurities in isotopically pure semiconductors will also be 
              investigated.  The results will lead to improved modeling of  electronic
              devices with every decreasing dimensions and  increasing complexity.  ***
