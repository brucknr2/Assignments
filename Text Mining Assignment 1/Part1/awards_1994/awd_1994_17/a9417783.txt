Abstract    :
              This RUI grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports  undergraduate studies
              of Professor Curran at the College of the  Holy Cross. The studies focus on the
              role of enforced proximity on  intramolecular reactions as models for enzyme
              catalysis.  Structural  analogues of Kemp's triacid (a cyclohexanetricarboxylic
              acid) with  variation in the third axial and equatorial groups will be used as 
              molecular templates for ten projects. These independent projects  are designed
              to unravel how changes in the steric and electronic  nature of neighboring
              functional groups affect the rate of the  acylolysis reaction.    In this
              synthetic project Dr. Fendler will study the steric and  electronic effects of
              neighboring groups on the rate of acylolysis of  Kemp s triacid to model such
              effects on enzymatic reaction rates.  The studies clarify important structural
              effects and will provide  undergraduate students with an excellent experimental
              training in  interdisciplinary chemical research.
