Abstract    :
                We do not clearly understand what the benefits and costs of group living are
              for primates generally.   Sex differences may play a role.  In most primate
              species, females remain in their natal groups for life, whereas males disperse
              prior to maturity.  Given the prevalence of this female-bonded system, what are
              the benefits and costs of male group members for females?   The number of males
              per group varies between and within primate species, but we do not know why. 
              This dissertation project will examine some short-term benefits and costs of
              sociality in such a female-bonded primate social system in Costa Rica.  The
              main benefits proposed for group living are predator protection and improved
              access to resources, while tha main cost is presumed to be within-group
              competition.  The study will compare specific behaviors associated with
              predator defense, resource defense, and resource competition in males and
              females.  Findings will be related to evolutionary explanations of primate
              sociality.  Information from the project will enhance our understanding of
              sociality and its adaptive significance in primates.  The project will also
              train a very promising young scientist.
