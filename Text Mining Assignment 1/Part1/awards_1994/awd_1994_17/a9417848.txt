Abstract    :
              This award is for support for three years of funding to  perform physical and
              visible studies of ice cores from the  Siple Coast drainage of West Antarctica,
              for paleoclimatic  and ice-dynamical purposes.  The visible inspection will 
              help to assess the utility of visible annual layering for  dating purposes of
              ice cores from West Antarctica and  studies of an ice core from Ice Stream C
              will provide a  calibration of passive seismic measurements being made by 
              another group on Ice Stream C.  The results of this study  should provide
              essential information for dating of the ice  cores planned from West Antarctica
              and should lead to a  better understanding of the processes controlling fabric 
              development and flow of ice.
