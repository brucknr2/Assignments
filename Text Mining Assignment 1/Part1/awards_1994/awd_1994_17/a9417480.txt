Abstract    :
                                              9417480  Li    This is a  three year cooperative
              research project  proposed  by Drs. Yuan -Hui Li and Christopher Measures,
              University of  Hawaii, and Professors T. M. Hsiung and Su-Cheng Pai,  Taiwan
              National University.   This proposal requests funds  to carry out oceanographic
              research to understand the  seasonal distribution patterns of the trace metals
              in the  East China Sea and Kuroshio-Current System.  This study is a  part of
              the international Joint Global Ocean Flux (JGOF)  Experiments.  The goal of
              this study is to improve the  understanding of the sources, sinks, and
              transport processes  of the trace elements in this region as well as their 
              contribution to the Western Pacific.   The investigators are  highly regarded
              for their analytical abilities for  oceanographic analysis and their
              contribution to ocean  research.   The proposed collaboration is mutually 
              beneficial.  The U.S. principal investigators will benefit  from the access and
              the ship and data support from the  Taiwan oceanographic surveys in a unique
              part of the Pacific  Ocean where little or no trace element data are available,
               while Taiwan scientists will gain data on trace metal  distribution with which
              they can greatly improve the  understanding of the dynamics of regional seas.  
              This is an  excellent project, which addresses an important problem in 
              chemical oceanography.   This project is jointly supported  by the NSF and the
              Taiwan National Science Council (NSC),  which provides major support for ship
              and laboratory  operations in Taiwan.  The modest support from the NSF in  this
              case is extensively leveraged by the NSC.
