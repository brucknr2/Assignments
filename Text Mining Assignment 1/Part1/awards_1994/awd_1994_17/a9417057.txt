Abstract    :
              Starrfield  9417057    Novae occur in cataclysmic binary systems in which a
              Roche lobe  filling secondary is losing hydrogen-rich material through the 
              inner Lagrangian point onto a white dwarf primary.  The  accumulating shell of
              material on the white dwarf is unstable to a  thermonuclear runaway and
              hydrodynamic simulations of this  phenomenon reproduce many of the observed
              features of the nova  outburst.  The proposed research falls into two main
              areas:   theoretical studies of the classical nova outburst and related  topics
              using both the PI s hydrodynamic-nucleosynthesis stellar  evolution code plus a
              new radiation-hydrodynamic code and, in  addition, optical observational
              studies in support of the  theoretical investigations.    The questions to be
              answered theoretically are: (1) Since virtually  all well studied novae exhibit
              enriched nuclear abundances in the  material ejected by the explosion, what is
              the source of that  enrichment? (2) Since many recent novae exhibit ejecta
              enriched in  oxygen, neon, and magnesium, what are the consequences of
              accretion  onto ONeMg white dwarfs and why do these novae eject so much 
              material? (3) Since both V1500 Cygni and GQMus have been identified  as binary
              systems containing magnetized white dwarfs (AM Her  variable), what are the
              consequences of strong magnetic fields on  the outburst? (4) Since observations
              of novae by the ROSAT and IUE  satellites have now measured the turn off times
              for V1974 Cygni and  GQMus, what is the cause of the cessation of nuclear
              burning and  the return to quiescence of the white dwarf? (5) Since we now have
               superb collections of data on the outbursts of a number of recent  novae such
              as V1974 Cyg, Cas 1993, and LMC 1990#1, how well can   we simulate the
              outbursts of these novae? (6) Since all fast novae  seem to experience a phase
              of super-Eddington luminosity, what are  the critical factors that produce this
              phase?      Finally, optical observations to study the evolution of novae in  
              outburst and determine energy b udgets, elemental abundances, and  turn off
              times will be continued.  ***
