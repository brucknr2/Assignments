Abstract    :
              9417018  Moum  A horizontally-towed body fully instrumented to resolve
              horizontal  shears over   vertical scales of 1-70 m while measuring turbulent
              fluctuations  along the towing   path will be developed and tested in a
              scientific experiment. The  towed body will be   capable to operate at depths
              up to 3000 m and within 100 m of  sloping boundaries.   The science experiment
              will determine the representative scales of  mixing and   internal waves in an
              area of rough topography and abrupt bathymetry  on the   continental shelf of
              the Eastern Pacific and compare these to  abyssal values in the   interior of
              the ocean away from boundaries.
