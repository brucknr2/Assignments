Abstract    :
              9417423  Livingston         By the end of their lifetimes, the U.S. Joint Global
               Ocean Flux Study (U.S. JGOFS)  and Global Ecosystems  Dynamics (GLOBEC) will
              have accumulated enormous databases  on the biogeochemistry and ecology of the
              world ocean.  Translating the results of hundreds of experiments and  hundreds
              of thousands of observations, collected at many  places and over more than a
              decade of time, into a statement  of how the ocean functions as a dominant
              component in global  ecology is a daunting task.  Before the final modeling and
               synthesis can be done, the immense data base must be  collected and organized,
              subjected to quality control  checks, and organized for redistribution.  That
              is what the  principal investigator and his colleagues on this grant will  do. 
              They will organize a user-friendly data management  system enabling individual
              U.S. JGOFS-GLOBEC scientists to  submit and retrieve high-quality data rapidly
              and in a  standardized, well-organized format while these two  initiatives are
              still underway.  Each investigator will then  have access to synoptic data
              collected by other  investigators at any given site or on any given cruise.  On
               a grander scale and extending beyond the lifetimes of the  two initiatives,
              biogeochemical and ecological modelers will  be able to access pre-linked
              database for studies of global-  scale ocean phenomena.  Data management
              efforts such as this  one are important for maximizing the scientific benefit 
              derivable from large multi-investigator, multidisciplinary  research projects
              like U.S. JGOFS and GLOBEC.
