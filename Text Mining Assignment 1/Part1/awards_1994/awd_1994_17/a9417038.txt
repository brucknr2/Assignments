Abstract    :
              9417038  van Geen       This project will test the hypothesis that accumulation
              of  Cd is enhanced in suboxic sediments, potentially altering the  global
              oceanic inventory.  Cd is one of two tracers used to infer  nutrient content of
              the deep ocean, and at present results from  Cd do not agree with those of the
              other tracer, 13-C.  Determining the cause of the discrepancy will permit more 
              accurate estimates of past ocean nutrients, which are related to  primary
              production and therefore to the global carbon cycle.  ***
