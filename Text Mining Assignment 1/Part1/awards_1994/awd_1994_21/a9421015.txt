Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9421015  Julia Kornfield    The structure of polymeric materials
              under the effect of hydrodynamical forces will be experimentally investigated,
              with application to designing and processing materials with engineered
              macroscopic properties.  Two, model polymeric materials with intrinsically
              anisotropic structures have been selected as model materials, block copolymers
              and side-group liquid crystals.  Molecular and microstructural flow-induced
              alignments will be measured as a function of macroscopic stress and strain
              during floe, at different length scales.  A series of mechanical, optical and
              Nuclear magnetic Resonance (NMR) techniques developed by the P.I. will be used
              to monitor the structural evolution of polymer melts during continuous and
              oscillatory shear motion.  It is expected that the results of the research will
              guide the polymer selection and the corresponding processing steps require to
              achieved a desired microstructural alignment and macroscopic properties.    The
              project combines fundamental experiments and new ideas for industrially
              relevant polymeric materials and devices.  Innovative ideas are proposed
              concerning the use of flow induced microstructures in polymers, and use of
              stress to switch the structure and related properties of a polymer between two
              states.  ***
