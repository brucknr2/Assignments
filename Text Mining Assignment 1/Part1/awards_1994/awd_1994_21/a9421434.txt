Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
              supports  research by Dr. Lisa McElwee-White of the Chemistry Department,
              University of Florida,  on the use of metal carbynes in organic synthesis.  New
              routes to seven- and eight-membered  metallacycles, cyclobutanones, fused
              vinylcyclopropanes, furans, oligomers, and other  products will be developed. 
              Radical cation and carbene intermediates are formed during  photolysis of
              molybdenum and tungsten carbynes.  After rearrangement and loss of the  carbyne
              ligand, generation of a variety of organic products is possible.  For example, 
              complexes with carbyne substituents which contain tethered olefins and dienes
              can trap the  intermediates by intramolecular ene reaction, cyclopropanation,
              metathesis or  4+2   cycloaddition.  Carbon-carbon bond formation by attack of
              the radical cations on unsaturated  species can also be exploited, as can
              intramolecular trapping to yield cyclized products.    Organometallic compounds
              in which the metal is bound to carbon by a triple bond are called  carbynes. 
              Although much is known about the reactions of these compounds, they have not 
              been used in organic synthesis.  In this research, a wide variety of cyclic
              organic compounds  will be prepared using this approach, which may offer a
              simple route to many complex  organic structures.
