Abstract    :
              This is the initial funding of a project submitted by the Computer  Sciences and
              Telecommunications Board (CSTB) of the Commission on  Physical Sciences,
              Mathematics, and Applications of the National  Research Council (NRC).  The
              CSTB organizes a  multi-stage  convening activity for academia, business, and
              industry to consider  the deployment of technologies and services expected for
              the near-  term national information infrastructure (NII), their relationships 
              to key applications which are representative of those under the NII  umbrella,
              and their anticipated degree of interoperability.   Activities under this
              project include an initial workshop to  structure the kinds of information on
              which common understanding is  desired, a solicitation of white papers to
              explore industry,  technology, and applications perspectives based on the
              outcome of  the initial workshop, convening of a larger forum to air and 
              discuss perspectives presented in the white papers, and a synthesis  of the
              insights from all these activities and from related reports  generated by
              others into a succinct summary to inform the  development of the initial phase
              of the NII  roadmap  development.
