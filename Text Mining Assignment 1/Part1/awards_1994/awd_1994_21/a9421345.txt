Abstract    :
              9421345  Tarduno   This award provides one-half the funding required to obtain
              laboratory equipment for paleomagnetic research, including a superconducting
              magnetometer, a thermal demagnetizer, an alternating field demagnetizer, and a
              magnetic susceptibility bridge. This instrument system is to be installed and
              operated in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at the
              University of Rochester. The University is committed to providing the remaining
              funds necessary for the acquisition of the equipment. The equipment will be
              used primarily in the research of the Principal Investigator and his qtudents
              in three general areas: (1) Tectonics-geodynamics, (2) Magnetostratigraphy and
              geomagnetic reversal chronology, (3) environmental magnetism and the fidelity
              of the geomagnetic record.  ***
