Abstract    :
              SRS 94-21743  Rung  This three-year project will support the seventh in a series
               of surveys sponsored by the Conference Board of the  Mathematical Sciences
              (CBMS), and conducted by the American  Mathematical Society (AMS) to gather
              data on activity in  academic departments in the mathematical sciences.  The 
              surveys have been conducted at five-year intervals,  beginning in 1965.  This
              national survey of two-year and  four-year institutions obtains detailed data
              on  undergraduate enrollment, faculty counts and  characteristics, and general
              academic activity.  Separate  questionnaires are used for four-year and
              two-year  institutions.  A stratified random sample of institutions is 
              selected.  Data and analysis are presented in a survey  report appearing in the
              Mathematical Association of America  (MAA) notes and Reports Series of the MAA,
              and are further  distributed through presentations at professional meetings 
              and special articles.    This project will be conducted under the direction of
              a nine-  member committee broadly representative of the academic  communities
              to be surveyed.  Parties involved in significant  redesign and restructuring of
              undergraduate education in  mathematics will be important contributors to
              planning for  this effort as well.
