Abstract    :
              CTS-9421089  David Cahill  U/Ill, Urbana          ABSTRACT         Experimental
              measurements of  thermal conductivity will be carried out on thin-film
              amorphous oxide layers. These layers are typical of coatings used to protect
              high-temperature components such as turbine blades. The work seeks to
              understand the role of various proposed mechanisms for heat transfer in these
              films. Improved understanding potentially will be used to produce novel systems
              with improved properties.
