Abstract    :
              9421888  Laughlin    A theoretical study will be made of the microscopic quantum
              mechanics of high  temperature superconductors using a strategy that emphasizes
              experimental  phenomenology over first principles computation.  The goals of
              the work are to  reconcile the enormous number of experimental facts in this
              field with one  another, to prioritize these facts, to distinguish genuinely
              new physical  behavior from that due to sample imperfection, and to motivate
              significant new  experiments.  This approach reflects the view that the
              important new physical  ideas in this field have already been articulated, and
              that the task is now to  distinguish among them in the laboratory.  Theory must
              be involved in this  process because the evidence of new physics is subtle and
              is often found in the  inconsistencies between one experiment and another. 
              Also, it has now become  evident that experimental confusion tends not to clear
              up by itself in this  field. Some specific computations for magnetic
              Hamiltonians are also proposed  as is some further investigation into the
              properties of superconducting states  that violate time-reversal symmmetry. 
              This is a natural extension of work on  anyon superconductivity performed on
              the previous grant.  %%%  A program of theoretical research on high temperature
              superconductivity will be  undertaken which emphasizes interpreting existing
              experimental results and  building on these to create new models and suggesting
              new experiments.  ***
