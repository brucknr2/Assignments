Abstract    :
                9421393  Puzdrowski    All vertebrate animals possess a reflex response system
              that allows them to stabilize the eyes as the head is moved -- referred to as
              the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR).  The brain circuits which control the reflex
              are similar throughout vertebrates with the exception that they are somewhat
              different in certain fishes (the "elasmobranchs").  With this award Dr. Rick
              Puzdrowski will conduct experiments to determine if the form of the
              elasmobranch VOR circuit is a unique specialization of that group, or instead
              is a fundamental circuit plan from which the circuits of all other vertebrates
              may have evolved.  This will be accomplished by examining details of the
              anatomy and physiology of the VOR circuits in fish related to the
              elsamobranchs.  The information provided by this research will give us
              important insights into how the fundamental operations of our brains were
              built-up during the course of evolution.  ***
