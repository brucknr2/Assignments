Abstract    :
              9421714  Wojcicki       Two research projects at the forefront of elementary 
              particle physics are supported by this grant to a Stanford  University faculty
              member, postdoctoral associates and  graduate students.  Data recently obtained
              will be analyzed  to yield by far the best results on rare decays of neutral K 
              mesons.  That will provide critical tests of the validity of  the Standard
              Model theoretical structure and clues to its  possible extension and
              refinement.  The masses of the  neutrinos the lightest members of the
              elementary particle  families a continuing important subject.  Recent hints
              that  those masses are not zero provide further stimulus for the  second
              activity, a conceptual feasibility study, in  collaboration with physicists at
              other institutions in this  country and abroad, of a bold experimental search
              for  oscillations among neutrinos in different families whose  objective is a
              specific technical design that will make use  of National Laboratory
              facilities.  ***
