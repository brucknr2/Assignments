Abstract    :
              9421360    Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase) has been
              shown to be involved in learning and memory in both mammals and fruit flies. 
              This enzyme has properties which have suggested that it may be a "molecular
              switch", capable of initiating changes in cellular properties.  Studies of CaM
              kinase in Drosophila melanogaster have shown that this enzyme is required for
              learning and memory in an associative behavior.  In addition, it has been shown
              that the larval neuromuscular junction of flies expressing an inhibitor of CaM
              kinase produce abnormal repetitive firing to single stimuli, and have depressed
              plasticity.  This model system is being used to investigate the molecular basis
              of these effects.  A mutant lacking CaM kinase provides a template on which to
              test theories about the enzymatic properties of the kinase which are required
              for normal neuronal activity.
