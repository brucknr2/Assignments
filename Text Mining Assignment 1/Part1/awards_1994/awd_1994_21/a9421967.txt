Abstract    :
              Drs. Hellman and Healey are conducting a small, interdisciplinary conference on
              "Quantum Measurement:  Decoherence and Modal Interpretations."  The workshop is
              to take place at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, May 4-7, 1995. 
              Their goal is to bring together leading physicists and philosophers of science
              who share a common interest in the problems of quantum measurement so that each
              group may become better acquainted with work of the other group.  Both groups
              have been actively pursuing research programs that may represent genuine
              progress on this long-standing, deep problem-area in the foundations of quantum
              mechanics.  Participating philosophers of science are concentrating on various
              recently proposed "modal" and "interactive" interpretations which, consistently
              with known limitations, allow assignments of definite values of measurable
              quantities in certain circumstances (including measurement interactions) in
              which such values are not recognized according to the conventional
              interpretative framework.  Participating physicists are concentrating on both
              the evidence for a genuine problem at the macroscopic level and on the role of
              environmentally-induced decoherence of the state in bringing about definite
              values of measurable quantities.  All participants  should seek to understand
              how these proposals are related to one another and to what extent any promising
              approach to the measurement problem emerges from them.  The conference can
              stimulate interdisciplinary cooperation in the continued pursuit of answers to
              these related questions.
