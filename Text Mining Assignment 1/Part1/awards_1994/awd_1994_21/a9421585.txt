Abstract    :
              9421585  Mattice    This award supports Professor Wayne Mattice and a
              postdoctoral  fellow and a graduate student from his research group at the 
              University of Akron, to collaborate in materials research with  Professor Kurt
              Binder of the Physics Institute of the University  of Mainz, German, and
              Professor Ulrich Suter, of the Polymer  Institute of ETH, Zurich, Switzerland. 
              The objective of their  collaboration is to develop improved methods for the
              study of  polymers.  Combining the strengths of the three research groups  and
              avoiding duplication of effort will facilitate efficient  development of
              algorithms and software for simulating physical  properties of these
              macromolecules.  The new software should be  particularly robust because it
              will combine the special strengths  of the three laboratories.    Simulations
              of the physical properties of macromolecules  generally are much more difficult
              than simulations of small  molecules.  These challenges arise from differences
              in the  numbers of conformations, distance scales and time scales.  There  are
              several current approaches for the design of simulations,  each of which have
              only limited application to selected  circumstances.  For example, fully
              atomistic simulations are  severely limited in the time and space scales of the
              physical  phenomena that can be addressed, while, on the other hand, 
              simulations on lattices can incorporate large scales of time and  distance, but
              cannot incorporate sufficient structural detail so  that the chains in the
              simulations can be identified with real  polymers.  The proposed U.S.-European
              collaboration is intended  to develop methods that combine the best attributes
              of both these  techniques, so that the simulations will have greatly improved 
              usefulness.  ***
