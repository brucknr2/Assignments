Abstract    :
              9421279  Middleton    This project connects Montcalm Community College to the
              Internet over a 56  kbps line.  Faculty and students at the school benefit from
              access to the  resources of the Internet, including libraries and
              supercomputers.  In  addition, they are able to communicate and collaborate
              with colleagues at  other institutions in pursuit of research and educational
              projects.  The  award provides partial support of the project for two years.
