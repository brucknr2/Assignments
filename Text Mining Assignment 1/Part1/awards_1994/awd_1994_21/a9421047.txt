Abstract    :
                 This workshop is designed as a first step to exchange information and write a
              report on the evolution of biochemical mechanisms for signal transduction, from
              simple unicellular to complex multicellular organisms.  The workshop will
              search for general principles and will hope to start a database and network,
              and to catalyze research in this important area of biology.  The workshop will 
              begin to define the important issues in the evolution of biological information
              processing.
