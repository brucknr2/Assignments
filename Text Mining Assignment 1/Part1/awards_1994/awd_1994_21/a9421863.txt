Abstract    :
              9421863  Messing    This is a planning grant proposal to conduct a planning 
              meeting with potential industrial members to establish an   Industry/
              University Cooperative Research Center for Particulate  Materials at
              Pennsylvania State University.    To remain competitive with the U.S. as well
              as internationally,  powder/particulate material industries must actively
              engage in the  technology improvement and development.  An Industry/University 
              Cooperative Research Center for Particulate Materials could provide  a
              horizontally-integrated, generic research program for the benefit  of the
              powder/particulate material processing and manufacturing  industries.  The
              major research thrusts include:  powder synthesis,  powder handling and flow,
              grinding and dispersion, press and sinter  systems, and characterization in
              support of these emphasis areas.    Currently, industry has already endorsed
              the concept of the  Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for
              Particulate  Materials through cash membership from three companies and 
              equipment donations from three other.  A planning meeting is  scheduled to be
              held on September 27-28, 1994.  It is anticipated  that over 30 industrial
              representatives will attend the meeting.    The Program Manager recommends
              Pennsylvania State University be  awarded $10,000 for six months to conduct
              this planning meeting.
