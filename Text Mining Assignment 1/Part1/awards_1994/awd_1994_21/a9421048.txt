Abstract    :
              Professor Hounshell is convening a workshop of  natural scientists, policy
              makers, historians, social and behavioral scientists to establish the
              dimensions of the impact of the Cold War on science and technology.  With an
              understanding of how the Cold War shaped the development and institutions of
              science and technology, the participants will then turn to formulation of
              realistic science and technology policies for the post-Cold War era.  This
              workshop will be held at the Santa Fe Institute near to Las Alamos, the site
              where the first atomic bomb was developed and one of the premier Cold War
              institutions.  The workshop will be held from September 19-20, 1994.    The
              Cold War altered the course of science and technology (S&T) in both the United
              States and the Soviet Union.  The pursuit of knowledge became an instrument for
              ensuring national security.  Government policies for funding S&T  shifted
              dramatically as did the methods of producing new knowledge.  National security
              establishments burgeoned and brought into being new institutions for the
              manipulation of knowledge.  With the collapse of the Soviet Union and the
              Eastern Bloc, the rationale for the existence of many of the institutions,
              structures, patterns of thought, habits, culture and mentalities collapsed as
              well.  As we move to a post-Cold War S&T policy, a full understanding of the
              development of these patterns is essential in order most effectively to replace
              them with policies to meet the new situation.   This workshop will provide the
              background for the construction of these new policies.
