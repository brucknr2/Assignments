Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a three year study to analyze  geophysical data
              (airborne and ground based radio-echo profiles,  surface ice motion and strain
              rate data, snow accumulation rate  and surface temperature data) collected both
              on Taylor Dome and  Taylor Glacier to aid in the paleo-climatic interpretation
              of the  Taylor Dome ice core.  The project will have three components: 1) 
              Processing of data from the airborne radio-echo survey which was  flown  over
              Taylor Dome.  This data will be combined with ground-  based radar profiles and
              used along with the stratigraphy to  infer mass balance and ice flow, using 2-D
              and 3-D ice flow  models; 2) Refinement and improve-ment of  thermomechanical
              model  calculations (incorporating ice velocity, strain data, surface 
              accumulation rate data and ice core data) to allow a better  dating of the deep
              ice core; and 3) Analy-sis of all data sets in  order to compare the ice core
              paleoclimate record with the  radiocarbon-dated Dry Valleys record of
              paleoclimate.  No new  field work is involved in this project.
