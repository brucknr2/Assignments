Abstract    :
              9421807  Kamil   A major challenge confronting biology today is to understand
              the evolution and adaptive significance of cognitive abilities.  In order to
              meet this challenge,  biologists have begun to investigate how cognitive
              abilities are actually used by animals in confronting the problems they face in
              nature.  This information, in turn, leads to hypotheses about how different
              species may possess differing suites of cognitive abilities.  In the proposed
              research, Drs. Kamil and Balda will use a comparative approach, studying
              closely related species whose natural histories are different.  Because the
              natural histories differ, the species confront somewhat  different  challenges
              in nature and therefore, they hypothesize, possess  differing cognitive
              abilities.  In one set of experiments, they will investigate difference in
              spatial memory that are associated with species differences in dependence on
              stored food whose locations are remembered by food-caching animals.  In another
              set of experiments, they will test for differences in cognitive ability among
              species who differ in sociality.  These two sets of experiments will further
              our understanding of the evolution of cognition and of the role of cognitive
              abilities in the natural world.
