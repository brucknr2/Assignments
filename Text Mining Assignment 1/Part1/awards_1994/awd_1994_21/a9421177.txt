Abstract    :
              The post-doctoral fellow supported by this award  will work on the general
              problem of assessing the impact of data collected in the upper ocean to climate
              model predictions   The efficacy of assimilating upper ocean velocity data as
              part of an Ocean Analysis System (OAS) and their impact on coupled model based
              predictions of seasonal to interannual climate variabilitywill be investigated 
              This work will provide the needed guidance and justification for transferring
              the TOGA observing system in the Pacific from a research to an operational
              mode.
