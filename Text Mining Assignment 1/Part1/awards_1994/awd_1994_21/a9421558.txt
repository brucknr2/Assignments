Abstract    :
              Proposal  #9421558  Wood    Biologically relevant environmental monitoring can
              be achieved using the genetic responses of microbes to environment conditions
              as sensors, particularly the specific and generalized responses to toxicity. 
              The generalized toxicity response may be especially important when prior
              knowledge of the type of toxin is unavailable.  Real-time transduction of the
              genetic responses is most commonly provided by coupling a gene encoding a
              bioluminescent protein to the system.  The information content of a single
              luminescent signal generally is insufficient to compensate for the complexity
              of living systems, however.    The Promega Corporation proposes development of
              a system based on multiplexing by wavelength to increase the information
              content of the signal transduction process.  Their research has shown that the
              color of light emitted by beetle luciferases can be controlled by changing less
              than 1% of their primary structures.  This unique situation should allow
              incorporation of functionally equivalent but distinguishable signal generators
              into a single sensor, thus granting internal control of the sensor response.   
              The product of this work will be a platform design for a signal transduction
              system to provide reliable and robust performance microbial sensors.  The
              general and fundamental nature of design will make it widely portable into
              different sensor configuration.
