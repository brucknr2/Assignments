Abstract    :
              ***  9421958  Cohen    This study is focused on University-Industry Research 
              Cooperative Centers (UIRC) and the most complete data base  about UIRC's yet
              collected with principal funding by the  Ford Foundation. This study will
              provide the most complete  analysis and extension of the available data.
              Relationships  between the funder(s) of UIRC's, the firms/industry 
              membership/size of UIRC budgets, areas of research, costs  and benefits to
              members, benefit-cost ratios, publications,  students trained, degrees,
              patents, and other inputs and  outputs are examined. The entire data base and
              analysis is  available to other researches. In addition to complete 
              statistical analysis of the data base follow-up telephone  interviews provide
              additional qualitative information  including initial probes of some industry
              managers of the  benefits and costs/advantages and disadvantages of IURC 
              membership.    ***
