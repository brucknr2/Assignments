Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program   supports
              research on interstitial hydrides by Dr. Robert Bau of the   Chemistry
              Department, University of Southern California.  Single-crystal   neutron
              diffraction will be used to determine the location of hydrogen   atoms in a
              variety of organometallic hydrides.  Emphasis will be placed   on metal cluster
              complexes in which hydrogen is suspected to be in   4-coordinate or
              5-coordinate sites.   Attempts will be made to correlate   the structural
              results with NMR data for reference use, and variable   temperature
              measurements will be taken in both neutron diffraction and   NMR experiments.  
              Compounds to be investigated include carbonyl hydride   clusters of ruthenium,
              osmium, rhodium and platinum.  Metal cluster compounds are important in many
              areas of materials and   inorganic chemistry as well as catalysis, and
              subsurface hydrogen may   have a role in reactions of metals in catalytic
              reactions.   However,   interstitial hydride in metals is not well understood. 
               In this   research, the structural characteristics of interstitial hydride in
              a   number of unusual environments will be determined.   These include  
              hydrogen atoms which may be surrounded by four or five nearest-neighbor  
              atoms, rather than the more commonly observed six, and also cases in   which
              contain two hydrogen atoms share the same interstitial space.     These studies
              will also expand knowledge about movement of hydrogen into   interstitial
              spaces with different geometries and temperature dependence   of hydrogen
              movement in metal hydrides.
