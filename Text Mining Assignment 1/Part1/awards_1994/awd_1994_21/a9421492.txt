Abstract    :
              This award made in the Organic Dynamics Program will support the research   of
              Paul Engel at Rice University. The research will focus broadly on the   free
              radical chemistry of azo and azoxy compounds. Specific areas of   research that
              will be addressed are :(1) determination of the   stabilization energy of
              alpha-azo  and azoxy radicals, (2) utility of   azoperesters as mixed
              bifunctional free radical polymerization   initiators, (3) rearrangement rates
              of the dimethylcyclopropylcarbinyl   radical as applied to radical clocks,(4)
              free radical reactions of the   azoxy group, (5) thermolysis rates of acyclic
              azoalkanes, and (6)   generation of preoxetane biradicals from azoalkanes. 
              Photochemical and   thermal approaches will be employed to generate the free
              radicals under   investigation.  This research will advance the fundamental
              understanding of the   generation  and stabilization of free radicals derived
              from azo and azoxy   compounds as well as explore their use in synthetic
              transformations and   as  initiators for high speed polymerizations.
