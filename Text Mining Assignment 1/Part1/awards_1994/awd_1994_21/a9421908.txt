Abstract    :
              The U.S. Congress created the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) in 1972. 
              Over the past two decades, European parliaments have adopted and adapted this
              idea.  This collaborative project will examine this transfer.  It will compare
              the instituitonal structures and practices of parliamentary technology
              assessment (PTA) in five European nations (France, Germany, the United Kingdom,
              the Netherlands, and Denmark) and the European Parliament in order better to
              understand: (a) how differences in political, cultural and institutional values
              influence variations in PTA goals, methods, and processes, (b) the impacts of
              these differences on the definition of problems, involvement of actors, and
              formulation of policy options, (c) the consequences of growing European
              cooperation in technology policy for the future conduct of technology
              assessment, and (d) the relative success of different PTA processes in Europe
              and their potential relevance to future evolution of technology assessment in
              the U.S. and other nations.  The anticipated outcome of the project is a
              collaborative book, written by researchers, analysts and practitioners in
              Europe and the United States.  For the first time in English,  a single
              resource will analyze the development, practices and results of technology
              assessment in a wide range of political cultures.
