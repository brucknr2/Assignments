Abstract    :
              The study will address long-standing and sometimes contentious issues concerning
              the federal  government s ability to accurately project future supplies and
              demands for scientific and engineering  personnel with particular attention on
              the doctoral-level workforce.  The adequacy of the United  States technical
              workforce to meet the needs of federal programs (e.g., in defense, energy,
              space and  health research), as well as the broader needs of an open
              technological economy, have been the focus  of policy concerns by the federal
              government for many decades.  The situation has become even more  confusing in
              recent years because of the confluence of many contradictory trends that
              influence both  supplies and demands for such human resources (e.g., the end of
              the Cold War and growing international  economic competitiveness).  This study
              will address the need to improve our ability to make more  accurate long-term
              projections of the technical workforce and, perhaps as important, a need to
              develop  better means for integrating such information into public and private
              decision-making at all levels of  our society.  A  12-member committee will be
              formed to carry out this study over an 18-month period.  The committee will be
              composed of a balanced membership of  individuals including labor-market 
              economists, other social scientists knowledgeable about the broader social
              implications of being able  to make (and use) effective long-range workforce
              projections, and public policy representatives with  experience in dealing with
              the needs of high-level policy officials in the Congress and the executive 
              branch
