Abstract    :
                Two laboratories interested in understanding cyclic physiological events
              related to different adaptive states of homeothermy will collaborate on
              comparative studies.  Professor Michael E. Rashotte's laboratory in the
              Neuroscience Program at the Department of Psychology, Florida State University
              (Tallahassee, Florida, USA) and Professor Yuri F. Pastukhov's laboratory at the
              Sechenov Institute of Evolutionary Physiology and Biochemistry (St. Petersburg,
              Russia) are the participants.  Each lab has extensive experience working on
              questions related to adaptive homeothermy, but one lab (Pastukhov) focuses on
              studies with mammals while the other lab (Rashotte) focuses on studies with an
              avian species.  Their collaboration will provide each lab with the expertise to
              carry out comparative studies on the questions of interest using small mammals
              and avian species.  The long-range objective is to make it possible for each
              lab to exploit species differences to answer fundamental questions about
              adaptive homeothermy.
