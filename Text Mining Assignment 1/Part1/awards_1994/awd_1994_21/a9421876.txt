Abstract    :
              9421876  Jaffe    This ocean sciences technology development project continues 
              development of a 3-dimensional sonar imaging system to be used in  zooplankton
              dynamics and ecological research.  Work will be  undertaken to fabricate an
              Optical-Acoustic Submersible Imaging  System (OASIS), that will allow tracking
              of zooplankton diel  cycles, migrations and nocturnal activity patters.  These 
              behavioral data will help to model predator-prey encounters,  euphausiid
              bioenergetics, and diel vertical migration behavior  under realistic
              environmental conditions.  The system will be  deployable from a
              remotely-operated underwater vehicle and will  simultaneously record both the
              target strength (acoustic) and a  high resolution optical image.  This combined
              technique will help  verify acoustic survey information and allow extrapolation
              of past  and present data.  Acoustical backscattering will be correlated to 
              animal orientation and this relationship, as well as other  optically verified
              correlations, will permit a better  interpretation of in situ acoustic data. 
              The acoustic system has  been deployed successfully.  Limited trials with
              camera imaging  systems have also been completed.  This work combine these two 
              systems.  The optical system is to be operated in a strobe mode,  triggered
              from the sonar imaging system.  In this way, when a  target is found in the
              sonar image at the appropriate location, the  strobe light will be triggered,
              and an optical image will be  recorded.
