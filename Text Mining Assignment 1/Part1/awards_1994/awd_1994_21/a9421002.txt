Abstract    :
              9421002  Howell     The goal of this project is to identify genes responsible
              for the role of the host in the movement of cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) and
              in the process to find plant genes that confer virus resistance. Two approaches
              are proposed. 1)Virus resistance mutants of Arabidopsis will be isolated and
              characterized and  2)Arabidopsis suppresser mutants susceptible to defective
              plant viruses will be selected. The second approach is novel in that it allows
              positive selection for susceptible plants that suppress mutations in any chosen
              viral gene or in any particular function of a given gene. If successful, it
              will open new avenues for the selection of genes important in plant disease
              resistance.  %%%  This proposal describes a novel approach to the study of
              plant-virus interactions and the identification of host functions involved in
              virus replication and movement in plants. Arabidopsis plants that are
              susceptible to infection by defective CaMV will be selected. Because the
              interplay between host and virus is most apparent in virus movement, mutations
              that disable the CaMV movement protein will be created.  In addition, virus
              resistant mutants will be selected and a virus-resistant trait, apparently a
              one-gene trait, which has been shown to block long-distance virus movement 
              will be characterized.  ***
