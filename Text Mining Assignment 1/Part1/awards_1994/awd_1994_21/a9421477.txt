Abstract    :
              Proposal #9421477  Montana State University    A team of Montana State
              University (MSU) engineering and business researches will join with managers
              and engineers from Woodward-Clyde Consultants to strategically manage the
              application of off-gas bioremediation technology in firms seeking effective air
              emissions treatment as a means to achieving environmentally conscious
              manufacturing.  This new technology promises to be less expensive, less
              intensive, and cleaner than existing emission control methods.    The MSU team
              will assess the state-of-the-art in off-gas bioremediation, facilitate
              Woodward-Clyde management in developing applications of the innovative
              technology, and will develop a case history of the Woodward-Clyde management
              strategy in applying innovative technology.  The management strategy identified
              for study in the project focuses on strategic technology management to
              integrate the many participants impacted by or involved in the innovation of
              off-gas bioremediation.  Key participants include research and productions,
              regulators, and industry.  The findings of this case study will be shared
              through workshops and other materials made available to industry, consultants,
              researchers, and managers with an interest in environmentally conscious
              manufacturing.    The potential impact from this project is enormous with the
              promise of commercialization of off-gas bioremediation and developing a
              universal model for practicing strategic environmental technology management in
              the U.S.
