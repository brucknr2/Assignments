Abstract    :
                  9421125  Bradley    An important problem in understanding brain/behavior 
              relationships is to determine how neural programs that  generate and coordinate
              movement are established during  early development.  With this award Dr. Nina
              Bradley will  use an important model system, the chick embryo, to describe  the
              coordination that develops between the limbs during  development.  The studies
              will be conducted to describe the  normal developmental sequence, and also to
              learn about the  relative importance of intrinsic developmental changes in  the
              nervous system versus changes in mechanical input from  the environment for
              producing developmental changes in motor  coordination.  This work will greatly
              enhance our  understanding of the control mechanisms that lead to  appropriate
              maturation of behavior, and is likely to suggest  ways that environmental
              influences can positively influence  brain and behavior.  ***
