Abstract    :
              9421704  Sarrafzadeh  This award supports the continuing series of Midwest
              Theory Days.  For the past few years researchers in theoretically oriented 
              fields of computer science have met two times a year in the  Midwest United
              States.  At the meetings, attendance have ranged  from 60 to 80, representing
              15 institutions.    These meetings bring Midwest researchers together to
              discuss  latest results in theoretical aspects of computer science and in  the
              transfer of rigorous methodologies to applied fields.  Students (mostly
              graduate) at all Midwest institutions benefit  from Midwest Theory Day by
              getting exposed to advances in  theoretical studies.  Approximately 30 to 40
              graduate students  attend each meeting.  ***
