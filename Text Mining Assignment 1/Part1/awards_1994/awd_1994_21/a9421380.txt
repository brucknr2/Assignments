Abstract    :
                                                        9421380  Simons    The region of the
              brain called the 'cerebral cortex' is  involved in cognitive functions such as
              learning,  recognizing objects, and performing skilled movements.  It's 
              function is determined, in part, by the way in which  billions of cortical
              nerve cells are interconnected.  Some  cortical cells are organized into
              working clusters called  'columns'.    This grant will allow a team headed by
              Dr.  Simons to study how cortical columns make computations about  information
              coming to the cortex from touch receptors.  The  analysis of  the columns will
              first involve physiological  studies of electrical signaling among cells within
              columns,  and these results will be understood by constructing  mathematical
              models of the column circuitry.    The results  will be important for
              understanding how the brain constructs  flexible representations of the
              external world.  This is  likely to advance our ability to design intelligent
              systems  that can perform some of the operations that are normally  performed
              in the cerebral cortex.  ***
