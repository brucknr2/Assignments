Abstract    :
              This proposal will further pursue results of the quality factor, or  ratio of
              wave frequency to damping rate, of MHD waves.  In response  to these recent
              findings regarding the size and wave modes of MHD  waves, the PI will:  (1) use
              numerical methods in investigating 3D  nulls to extend the more exact 2D
              results obtained so far and  bolster the WKB results, (2) quantify the size of
              the 'packing  fraction' in more unequivocal terms, (3) investigate the
              effective  quality factor for the case of long wavelength excitations and open 
              field configurations, (4) study effects of finite pressure and  thermal
              conduction, and (5) question other miscellaneous events,  including nonlinear
              effects, the quality factor for collisionless  systems, and the possible
              production of energetic particles.***
