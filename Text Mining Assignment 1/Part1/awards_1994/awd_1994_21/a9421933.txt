Abstract    :
              9421933  This project is for the study of all state research and  development
              expenditures for Fiscal Year 1994.  The project  will test a model for
              collecting accurate information on an  annual basis.    The approach described
              is to collect information through  close interaction with all 50 states, as
              well as selected  regional groups and national organizations dedicated to 
              state issues.  The resulting network of state officials will  provide guidance
              to the overall research project while also  collecting vital data through an
              extensive survey.  Battelle  will analyze the data, addressing a list of
              questions  identified in the proposal and the course of the project  concerning
              state research and development expenditures.    Upon completion of the project,
              a structure will be in place  for annual studies of state R&D activities.  Also
              an  accurate characterization of state involvement in research  and development
              will be prepared for distribution to state  and federal leaders in science and
              technology, science  policy researchers and others interested in the patterns
              of  U. S. research and development investment.  The data and  analysis will be
              of great value for policy formulation,  program development and program
              evaluation.
