Abstract    :
              9421770  Short  This is a special starter grant for a NSF Postdoctoral Research 
              Fellow in Plant Biology.  The starter grant is designed to help  establish an
              independent research career for the recipients of  the NSF research fellowship
              in plant biology.   Dr. Short has  conducted research on the molecular genetics
              of phytochrome  during the tenure of his NSF fellowship.  Dr. Short is now an 
              assistant professor at Queens College and proposes to initiate an 
              investigation on the role of phytochrome in the red-light  enhancement of
              phototropism in Arabidopsis thaliana with the  starter grant.  The long term
              goal of the research is to  understand the fundamental mechanisms of
              photomorphogenesis in  plants.
