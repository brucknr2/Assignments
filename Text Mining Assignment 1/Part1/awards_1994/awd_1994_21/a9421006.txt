Abstract    :
              9421006  Reisman  This is for 100% selective chemical vapor deposition of
              expitaxial films of Si, Ge and  SiGe on patterned substrates with a so-called
              'smart' chemistry based upon interrupting the flow of hydrogen during the
              deposition process.  The PI's refer to this process as 'alternating cyclic, AC,
              deposition' which has been tested and demonstrated to be effective during
              previous research.  The PI's wish to "further understand the underlying
              science" of the 'smart chemistry' with a study of the parameter space
              associated with the gaseous species involved in the reaction kinetics.  The
              research is relevant to the selective growth of films on patterned substrates
              and the removal of unwanted foreign particles.  This research may open new
              areas of device research, particularly with Si-Ge hetero-junction bipolar
              transistors (HBT's) for high frequency, microwave devices.  The research and
              education potential offers the possibility of new devices structures for the
              silicon-base integrated circuit industry.  The unique capability of the CVD
              system at MCNC remains at the heart of the research and is essential is this
              work is to continue to bear new and interesting results.  ***
