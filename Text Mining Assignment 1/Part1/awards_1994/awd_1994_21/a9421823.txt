Abstract    :
              9421823  Masek       This grant supports the research of 2 senior faculty, a 
              senior research physicist, a postdoctoral scholar and the  training of 3
              graduate students with CLEO collaboration  group.  They continue experimental
              operations at the CESR  electron-positron collider, the facility at Cornell 
              University supported by NSF.  Their particular interests are  first, in
              photon-photon collisions among whose products they  search for evidence of
              putative glueball production, and  more recently, B-meson decays.  Those
              studies are important  for strengthening the understanding of the fundamental 
              particles and their interactions.  ***
