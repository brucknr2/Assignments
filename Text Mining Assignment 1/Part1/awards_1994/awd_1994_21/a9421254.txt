              of genetic relatedness, including identification of parents, is central to many
              kinds of biological studies.  Relatedness and parentage can both be estimated
              through the use of genetic markers, though the rarity of good markers has
              limited this approach for many organisms.  However, new kinds of markers,
              including multi-locus fingerprints, minisatellites, microsatellites, and
              RAPD's, now make accurate kinship assessment a practical goal for just about
              any species.  This award will result in two computer program becoming generally
              available to the research community.  The first, RELATEDNESS, focusing on
              statistical estimates for genetic relatedness, will be a rewritten and
              restructure version of a program that has been available for several years. 
              The second program, PARENTAGE, will be specifically for paternity and maternity
              analysis.  It will be designed to make maximum use of the different kings of
              prior information available in studies of vertebrates, social insects, plants
              and other organisms.  This award is being supported by the Computational
              Biology Activity, Animal Behavior, and  Population Biology programs.      {   S
