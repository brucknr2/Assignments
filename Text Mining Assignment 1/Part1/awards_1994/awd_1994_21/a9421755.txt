Abstract    :
              9421755  Gupta    One of the classic problems in fluvial geomorphology and river
              basin hydrology is prediction of flows from ungauged river basins.  This is a
              very difficult problem because not only does it ilvolve notions of dynamics via
              the conservation equations, but also that of geometry via branching of river
              networks, and of probability due to the presence of fluctuations in river flows
              and river networks.  Since these notions recur across a broad range of spatial
              scales, the focus of our proposed research is on developing and empirically
              testing scaling invariance ideas and theories.  For the past several years,
              both the PIs have been extensively involved in exploring a scaling framework to
              study spatial rainfall, peak river flows viewed as channel forming discharges,
              and the 3-D structure of river networks.  Several unexpected and significant
              developments in this line of research within the last three years show that the
              scaling invariance ideas provide a very rich framework to tackle this problem. 
              In this proposal our objectives are: (1) to develop a geometric-statistical
              scaling theory of river networks, (2) to develop a statistical-dynamic scaling
              theory of river runoff, which are viewed as channel-forming discharges, (3) to
              develop a geometric-statistical-dynamic scaling theory to connect the 3-D
              geometry of river networks and flows and (4) to carry out tests of the theories
              in Objectives 1,2, and 3 via spatial data analysis and simulations.  This
              proposed research addresses how different notions of scaling, namely,
              geometric, dynamic, and statistical, can be woven together into a single,
              coherent theoretical framework to understand the physics of this problem and
              interpret space-time hydrologic data.  It has applications to a variety of
              hydrologic problems spanning a broad range of space and time scales.
