Abstract    :
              9421062  Allen    This Americas Program award will fund travel and related 
              expenses for ten U.S. scientists to participate in a  workshop on numerical
              particle transport theory.  Organizers  are Dr. G. Donald Allen, of Texas A&M
              University, and Dr.  Jean-Pierre Hennart, of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma
              de  Mexico.  Topics to be discussed will range from inverse  problems,
              theoretical and numerical approximation of  solutions, to results of newly
              developed computer codes in  one, two and three dimensions.  A significant
              feature of the  workshop will be the inclusion of graduate students of both 
              the U.S. and Mexican faculty participants.    Numerical transport theory is
              very demanding of  computational resources because of the large number of 
              independent variables that occur.  In the past, it has been  closely associated
              with applications of transport theory to  nuclear energy.  However, it is
              likely that other  applications, e.g., radiative transfer in planetary 
              atmospheres, will assume increased importance in the coming  years, especially
              as the demand  for computational accuracy  increases in such fields.  ***
