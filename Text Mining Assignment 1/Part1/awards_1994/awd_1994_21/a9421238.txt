Abstract    :
              9421238  Astrow  During the development of the neuromuscular system, the
              processes  of nerve cells initially make numerous contacts (synapses) with 
              muscle cells, many of which are later eliminated.  The mechanisms  that
              underlie this elimination of exuberant contacts are largely  unknown.  This
              research will use a novel model system to determine  whether this elimination
              is caused by changes in the nerve cells,  in the muscle cells, or whether
              changes in both elements contribute  to synaptic remodelling.  The elimination
              of redundant synapses is  a process that is an important part of development
              both in the  neuromuscular system and in the central nervous system.  The 
              definition of the factors that control this process will address a  question of
              fundamental importance in Developmental Neuroscience.
