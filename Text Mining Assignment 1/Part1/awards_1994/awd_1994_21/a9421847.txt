Abstract    :
              9421847  Fovell        Thunderstorms are of interest because of both the severe
              weather and the beneficial rainfall that they  produce.  A certain class of
              thunderstorms, known as multicellular storms, are very common in the
              Spring/Summer  months and typically are not severe, but bring much needed
              rainfall.  As their name implies, these storms are  composed of a sequence of
              individual updrafts ( cells ) and their concomitant precipitation.        While
              much have been learned about the behavior of multicellular storms, a few
              fundamental problems still  remain.  One such problem is that the factors that
              control the periodicity of cell formation and their temporal  behavior have
              never been determined.  Using an advanced numerical model, the Principal
              Investigator will attack  this problem.  Additionally, he will investigate how
              these storm modify their upstream conditions and, hence,  potentially the
              future evolution of the storm.        A third area of investigation is to study
              the structure and evolution of sea-breeze fronts and their role in  convective
              initiation.  While on the surface sea-breeze fronts and multicellular storms
              are quite different, they do  share dynamic similarities that make these
              studies related.        If successful, this research will lead to much improved
              understanding of the underlying dynamics of the  ubiquitous multicellular
              thunderstorms.  ***
