Abstract    :
              9421935  Kedem     This award is to purchase a small network of workstations
              with accessories and software to support 4 research projects:  1) Further
              development of Calypso, a software-based execution platform for
              high-performance computing.  This experimental project grew out of previous
              theoretical work dealing with abstract machines.  The current prototype will be
              further enhanced and tested on selected applications.  Special attention will
              be paid to scalability, load balancing, and fault tolerance.  2)
              Experimentation with Persistent Linda, an implementation of a fault-tolerant
              Linda built on top of lightweight transactions. Large-scale experimentation
              will be conducted using multiple machines executing long-running parallel
              computations.  3) Construction of an experimental platform for the easy
              implementation and evaluation of fundamental, symbolic computation algorithms.
              Special attention will be given to making the platform robust, flexible, and
              portable.  4) Distributed extension to a novel, centralized persistent object
              system will be developed. The system will be enhanced by new facilities such as
              type security, distributed locking, distributed synchronization, and
              collaborative applications.  ***
