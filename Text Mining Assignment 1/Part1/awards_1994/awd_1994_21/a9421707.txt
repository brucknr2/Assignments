Abstract    :
              9421707  Han       The standard model is the currently accepted  interpretation
              of the elementary constituents, quarks and  leptons, and the forces between
              them.  It does not explain  many central problems, such as the origin of mars. 
                   Understanding what lies beyond the standard model is  the central problem
              in high energy physics.  A conference on  this topic "Beyond the Standard Model
              IV", to be held Dec.  13-18, 1994 at the Granlibakken Conference Center on Lake
               Tahoe, California, organized and hosted by the Univ. of  California at Davis
              is likely to be timely, important and  fruitful.  It will allow for
              presentation of new  experimental and theoretical results, with discussions
              among  leading experts.  This is the fourth in the series of much  conferences,
              held every other year; all have been  successful.  ***
