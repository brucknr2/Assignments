Abstract    :
              9421539  Tessier    It is proposed that a mechanism by which functional
              biodiversity of filter-feeding zooplankton is maintained is by spatial-temporal
              environmental variation in phytoplankton-resource abundance.  Species can be
              viewed as differing in their ability to exploit rich versus poor resource
              conditions, and such differences create unique interactions between each
              species and a heterogeneous environment.  The proposed research would examine
              the breadth of species diversity within the Daphnia inhabiting the lakes of
              midwest U.S., and use a broad range of natural resource assemblages to test the
              generality of this exploitation tradeoff.  Using a novel approach to quantify
              resource richness from the organisms's perspective, this research would also
              examine for an association between assemblage composition, and environmental
              resource conditions among lakes and vertical habitats within lakes.  Two
              experimental studies will explore the consequences of this tradeoff to
              competitive and food web interactions.    This research will identify key
              factors regulating the diversity of Daphnia, which play a pivotal role in the
              ecology of freshwater lakes.  The research provides an explicit test of a
              general concept linking consumer traits and diversity of ecological
              communities.  It also lays the groundwork to explore how biodiversity within an
              important group of organisms translates into consequences at the ecosystem
              level.
