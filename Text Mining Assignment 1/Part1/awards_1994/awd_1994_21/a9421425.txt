Abstract    :
              9421425  Truskey  This project is on research to evaluate the hypothesis that
              the  size and number of focal contacts regulate cytoskeleton  organization
              which, in turn, controls cell shape and growth.  A  major problem in cell
              culture and tissue engineering is retaining  morphology and function in vitro. 
              This research will study rat  hepatocytes because they are difficult to
              maintain in a  differentiated state in vitro, and spreading has been correlated
               with changes in cell replication and protein synthesis.  The  specific aims of
              this research are to: (1) develop micropatterned  surfaces with immobilized
              peptides and sugar groups; (2) study  the effect of pattern dimensions and
              ligand density upon focal  contacts, cytoskeleton organization, cell shape, and
              growth; and  (3) study the effect of perturbations in focal contact area and 
              cytoskeleton organization upon hepatocyte spreading and function.  ***
