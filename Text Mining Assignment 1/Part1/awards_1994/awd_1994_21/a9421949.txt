Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9421949  G. Ruff    An experimental investigation to evaluate the
              momentum transport of non-evaporating solid spheres in a turbulent flow will be
              undertaken.  A test Facility will produce a quasi-homogeneous turbulent field. 
              The mean and fluctuating velocities, as well as the temporal and spatial
              integral scale of turbulence, will be measured.  The drag force on a solid
              sphere suspended in the turbulent field will be determined, and the expression
              for the drag coefficient within a broader turbulence length scale-particle
              Reynolds number domain will be obtained.    The work has relevance for
              modeling, with applications in various areas such as chemical and materials
              processing, solids transport, and fuel sprays.  ***
