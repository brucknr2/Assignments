Abstract    :
              9421109 Pearton  This research aims to investigate the properties of the most
              common light ion impurities (H, O, C) in binary (GaN, AIN, InN), ternary
              (InGaN, AlGaN, AlInN) and mixed group V (GaAsN, InAsN, AlAsN, GaPN) nitrides. 
              These materials have strong potential for short wavelength optical emitting
              devices and high temperature electronics.  Basic materials science information
              regarding energy levels, solubility and diffusivity of these most common
              impurities in epitaxially-grown films is lacking, and will provide important
              information to further progress in the understanding and utilization of III-N
              materials.  As in other semiconductors it is expected that H, O and C will have
              a strong effect on the electrical and optical properties of nitrides. %%%  The
              knowledge gained during this project will significantly improve understanding
              of the effects of the dominant residual impurities in epitaxially grown
              nitrides.  These thin films may find extensive application in visible and
              near-UV lasers for denser optical storage media and in electronics for
              automotive and other high volume markets where elevated temperatures and
              corrosive environments are present.  An important feature of the program is the
              training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area of
              materials research. ***
