Abstract    :
                        9421856  Evans  The National Aeronautics and Space Administration and
              the National  Science foundation have established a competitive awards program 
              for participation in a network of collaborative research in plant  biology. 
              The focus of the research will be on plant signal  transduction and cell
              differentiation in response to environmental  stimuli, especially gravity.  The
              goal of the program is to  encourage a coordinated interactive approach to
              studying important  problems in plant biology with the conviction that
              collaborative  research activities between a number of network participants
              with  complementary strengths in related research areas will have a 
              synergistic effect on scientific advances in these areas.  This  award supports
              activities that help coordinate laboratories  selected to participate in this
              program over the 5-year tenure of  the network grants.  ***
