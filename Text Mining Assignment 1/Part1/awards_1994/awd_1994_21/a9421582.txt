Abstract    :
                 9421582  Martin    A major challenge facing brain researchers is to explain
              how signals arriving in the brain from sensory receptors is translated into
              commands for movement.  In this grant, Dr. Martin will examine the organization
              of the region of the brain known as the motor cortex and its relation to the
              steering of forelimb movements directed toward visual targets.  There appear to
              be functional subregions of the motor cortex, and they will be analyzed in this
              work by selectively, and reversibly, inactivating parts of the motor cortex as
              movements are made.  This research will increase our understanding of the
              principles underlying biological motor control.  This understanding should have
              important implications for the design of robotic control circuitry and the
              development of prosthetic devices.  ***
