Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical  Chemistry program of the Chemistry   Division,
              Professor Marsha I. Lester of the University of Pennsylvania   will study the
              spectroscopy and reaction dynamics of open shell complexes   in order to: 1)
              map out the intermolecular potential energy surfaces   between a free radical
              and a collision partner by accessing   intermolecular vibrations via stimulated
              emission pumping and infrared   overtone excitation; 2) examine the change in
              the intermolecular   interaction between a free radical and a collision partner
               due to the   orientation of the orbital containing an unpaired electron; and
              3) induce   chemical reaction within a complex composed of a hydroxyl radical
              and a   molecular partner by surmounting the activation barrier to reaction via
                infrared overtone excitation of that radical.  Detailed understanding of
              reaction chemistry at the molecular level   requires  knowledge of the behavior
              of the reaction partners during the   short duration of the reaction process. 
              Free radicals, i.e.,  atoms or    molecules with an unpaired electron, play an
              essential part in reaction   processes but because of their short lived
              existence are difficult to   study in themselves and, especially, in a reaction
              process.  The present   research will provide fundamental knowledge and insight
              into the process   of chemical reactions taking place in the gaseous state.
