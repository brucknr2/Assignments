Abstract    :
              9421774  Niyogi  This project is on research  to better understand the dynamics
              of  growth factors and their receptors, focusing on the epidermal  growth
              factor system.  The object of the work is to manipulate  growth factor ligands
              as a means of altering trafficking.  There  are three  specific aims for the
              period of study: (1) to  manipulate parameters in receptor/ligand and
              receptor/cell  interactions in order to test previously constructed models of 
              receptor dynamics; (2) to investigate ligand transport through  model tissues;
              and (3) to study model autocrine/paracrine  regulatory systems created by
              inserting engineered ligands and  regulatory elements into cell lines.  The
              understanding of growth  factor/receptor dynamics and trafficking could lead to
               improvements in wound healing, drug delivery, gene therapy, and  tissue
              regeneration.  ***
