Abstract    :
              9421235         The major objective of this project is to test, by means of  a
              cross-cultural comparison, a proposed pathway for how young  children achieve
              the basic skills required for generating  sustained cooperative action with
              others (e.g., games,  conversations, working together on a common task). The
              proposed  pathway, based on prior work with children developing within 
              contemporary USA culture, will be tested through study of  children developing
              within Seltaman culture, a recently tribal  people of Papua New Guinea. Three
              features of this pathway are  expected to be conserved despite such a major
              change in the  cultural context for human development--the emergence of a new 
              readiness to imitate others' nonverbal actions around two years  of age (the
              imitative pattern), the role of the imitative pattern  in generating sustained
              bouts of nonverbal cooperative action  before children have sufficient verbal
              skills to generate  cooperative action, and the role of these bouts of
              nonverbal  cooperative action in facilitating children's development of  verbal
              means for facilitating cooperative action. To test these  expectations,
              Seltaman children between 1 and 5 years of age will  be videotaped weekly
              across a six-month period as they interact  with other children in the
              normally-occurring activities of their  village. The developmental course of
              nonverbal imitative acts,  the extent to which nonverbal imitative acts account
              for all  instances of cooperative acts, the use of imitative acts in 
              generating sustained bouts of cooperative activity, and the  selective
              occurrence of verbal means of facilitating cooperative  action within sustained
              bouts of nonverbal cooperative action  will be assessed through analysis of the
              resulting videotapes and  the transcriptions provided by villagers. These
              findings will be  integrated with those resulting from a broader-scope
              companion  project of young Seltaman children's social relationships to  assess
              the reasons for any commonalities and differences t hat  exist between USA and
              Seltaman culture in the developmental  pathway toward the mastery of
              cooperative action.    This project employs a cross-cultural comparison to test
              a  proposed developmental pathway for how young children achieve the  basic
              skills required for generating sustained cooperative action  with others (e.g,
              games, conversations, working together on a co  task). The proposed pathway,
              based on prior work with young  children developing within contemporary USA
              culture, will be  tested through the study of children developing within
              Seltaman  culture, a recently tribal people of Papua New Guinea. Because  the
              Seltaman culture differs from U.S. culture on a number of  dimensions that
              might influence the emergence of early  cooparative interactions, these data
              qwill provide a significant  step toward testing the universality of the
              devleopmental pathway  documented in past research. Three features of this
              pathway are  expected to be conserved despite such a drastic change in the 
              cultural context for development: (1) the emergence around two  years of age of
              a new readiness to imitate others' nonverbal  actions (the imitative pattern);
              (2) the role of the imitative  pattern in enabling young children to first
              generate a wide  variety of new patterns of sustained cooperative action,
              before  they have the verbal means to do so, and (3) the role of these 
              sustained bouts of nonverbal cooperative actions in facilitating  the child's
              development of verbal means of achieving cooperative  action.  This
              cross-cultural comparison addresses both key  theoretical issues (e.g., how
              conservatism and variability  coexist in paths of human development) and
              important practical  issues (e.g., revealing how to provide experiences that 
              facilitate young children's cooperation; filling the need for  cross-culturally
              validated answers to developmental questions  pressing upon educators and child
              care providers who work with  groups of children that are increasingly
              culturally diverse.)
