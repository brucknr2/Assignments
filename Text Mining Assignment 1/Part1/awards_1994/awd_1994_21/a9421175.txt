Abstract    :
              IBN-94-21175  Frank Moore    In some amphibian species, male courtship of
              females is rapidly suppressed by secretion of the steroid corticosterone in
              response to stressful environmental stimuli. This project will investigate the
              actions of stress-related steroid hormones on brain function and behavior. This
              species is uniquely valuable for study because its stress-sensitive
              reproductive behavior allows one to investigate two different actions of stress
              steroids on brain function: a rapid action that appears in a matter of minutes
              and a slowly-developing action that occurs across a period of hours. Studies of
              the behavior of the animal and of the electrical signals of the brain cells
              will help to identify the rapid and slow effects of several types of stress
              steroid hormones on the brain cells that control courtship behavior. The
              results of these studies have general significance because both rapid and slow
              brain effects of stress steroids are likely to be present in diverse species of
              animals. The findings should help to explain how environmental stressors act on
              the nervous system to impair reproduction in natural populations of animals and
              will provide a framework for understanding possible modes of stress steroid
              action on brain function in humans.
