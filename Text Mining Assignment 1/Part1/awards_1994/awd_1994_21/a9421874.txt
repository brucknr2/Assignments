Abstract    :
              9421874  Muller       This grant partially supports a three-day-long 
              International Symposium on Vector-Boson Self-Interactions at  the University of
              California at Los in February, 1995.  The  subject is important for
              confirmation of a unique feature of  the Standard Model of elementary
              particles.  the grant  provides funding for young scientists and students to 
              participate in the Symposium.  ***
