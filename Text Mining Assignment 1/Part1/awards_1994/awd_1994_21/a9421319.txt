Abstract    :
              9421319  Andrew H. Bass  Verbal and non-verbal communication skills are widely
              used  throughout the animal kingdom for mate selection and reproduction,  food
              collection and formation of social structures.  However, the  brain mechanisms
              involved in communication are frequently complex  and difficult to study.  Dr.
              Bass, a highly regarded behavioral  neuroendocrinologist,  has identified and
              characterized a unique  neural system of vocal communication in a simple
              vertebrate species  during his previous investigations.  This system is unique
              in that  a single muscle is responsible for the generation of sound.  In the 
              present study, Dr. Bass will use a highly creative and integrative  approach to
              study the brain mechanisms involved in generating  rhythmical vocal behaviors
              and the role of androgens in  gender-specific differentiation of that circuitry
              and behavior.   Previous studies identified a brain command center for vocal 
              behavior and electrical recordings will be used to determine the  anatomical
              connections of the system.  Additional studies will  investigate the ability of
              androgenic hormones to act within this  command center to facilitate the
              development of vocal behaviors in  these animals.  These studies have the
              potential to define the  actions of hormones on neural pathways leading to
              behavior changes,  which may be applicable to other species including man.
