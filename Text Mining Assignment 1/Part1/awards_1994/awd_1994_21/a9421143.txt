Abstract    :
                     ABSTRACT  9421143  Bar-Cohen    The proposal is to partially support a
              three-day workshop on Thermal Management in 21st Century Electronic Systems in
              the Fall of 1995. The workshop will bring together experts in electronics
              thermal management with experts in electronics systems technologies to discuss
              opportunities and barriers/limits to the implementation of new concepts in
              electronics. A report of the workshop proceedings will be edited by the PIs and
              distributed to participants and interested parties within three months of the
              meeting.
