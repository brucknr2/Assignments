Abstract    :
              9421096  Warren  This project is the continuation of an integrated study of the 
              optical and physical properties of the antarctic snow surface.  It  has several
              components which concern the processes by which global  climatic variability is
              imprinted into the proxy data recorded in  the antarctic ice.   It is based on
              a very successful  three-year  field effort during which the principal
              investigator acquired a  substantial body of data, including the effect of
              surface roughness  (sastrugi orientation) on the angular distribution of
              reflected  sunlight, the spectral distribution of thermal infrared radiation, 
              the mechanism of dry deposition of atmospheric sulfates in the snow  surface,
              and the isotopic composition of hoarfrost.    The primary emphasis will be on
              the production of a climatology of  the long-wave and short-wave radiation
              budget at the surface, to  include the contributions of carbon dioxide, ozone,
              water vapor,  clouds, and atmospheric ice crystals.  Radiative transfer models 
              will be tested under both clear-sky and cloudy-sky conditions, and  a monthly
              climatology of spectral and total long-wave cloud  radiative forcing at the
              surface will be determined.  These results  will feed into global programs
              studying the Earth's radiation  budget, providing  the coldest and driest
              surface end member  conditions.    In addition, interface temperature profiles
              will be analyzed for  differing mechanisms of heat transfer in snow, and
              sulfate aerosol  measurements will be studied to assess the contribution of
              wind  pumping to the deposition of trace elements in the snow.  ***
