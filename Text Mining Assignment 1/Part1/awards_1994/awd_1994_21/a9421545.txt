Abstract    :
              IBN 9421545  Terri Grodzicker    This proposal is to support a conference on
              Cell and  molecular biology of Aplysia to be held at Cold Spring  Harbor April
              19-24, 1995. The mollusc Aplysia, and a number  of other invertebrate animals,
              have proven extremely useful  in studies of basic cellular neurobiology. In
              large part  this is because of the extraordinarily large size of the  cells of
              its nervous system and the ability to recognize  these cells as unique
              individuals. This has allowed the  investigation of individual cells, their
              patterns of  interconnections, modulation of synaptic strength, behavior, 
              learning and development. The 1995 meeting will provide a  format for
              discussing new methods and findings that have  emerged in the cell and
              molecular biology of Aplysia and  other model invertebrate systems. These
              findings will be  considered in eight different session, each concerned with a 
              different level of analysis: ion channels, neurotransmitter,  synaptic
              transmission, cell imaging, circadian rhythm,  circuity and behavimr, learning
              and development. About 150  participants from 60 laboratories throughout the
              world are  expected to attend.
