Abstract    :
              9421712  Chave       This award provides partial funding in support of a 
              workshop on the technical feasibility of establishing  seafloor geomagnetic
              observatories to be held at the Woods  Hole Oceanographic Institution. The
              workshop will convene a  small group of U.S. and international experts in
              geomagnetic  field observation in order to focus on measuring the  geomagnetic
              field variations with ocean bottom  instrumentation, power supply to ocean
              bottom observatories,  and methods of data retrieval. The participants are 
              committed to writing a report describing the technical  options  and their cost
              estimates.  ***
