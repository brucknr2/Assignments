Abstract    :
              9421593  Jirsa  This project will continue technical coordination for NSF 
              projects funded under the NSF Initiative on Repair and  Rehabilitation which
              was begun in 1990 when the first group of  proposals were funded. During the
              first four years of the  project, the coordinator has organized meetings of the
              Principal  Investigators and produced annual progress reports which have  been
              disseminated to all interested parties. In addition, several  technical
              sessions at national meetings and a number of  presentations have been made to
              publicize the research work.  These coordination activities will continue until
              the conclusion  of the five year program. A major remaining activity will be to
               edit and produce a comprehensive technical summary document  containing
              contributions from all PI's. The summary document will  provide a single source
              reference for use by designers and others  interested in implementing the
              results of the program. The intent  is to develop a document which contains
              design requirements and  sufficient details for use in engineering practice.
