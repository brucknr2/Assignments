Abstract    :
              9421811  Raja  Description:  This proposal provides final  funding for one year
              to support participation  of Delhi University scientists currently  resident in
              the US and working on the DO  Experiment at the Fermi National Accelerator 
              Laboratory.  The project is headed on the US  side by Paul Grannis, Stony Brook
              with coPI,  Hugh Montgomery, Fermilab.  The cooperating  Indian scientist is
              Dr. Ram Shivpuri, Director  of the Centre for Detector and Related Software 
              Technology.  The Delhi group has extensive  experience with the study of quark
              and gluon  structure, with detectors, and have the  computational techniques
              required for particle  physics studies.  They also have a strong  capability
              with the design of software systems  for offline computer analysis of data. 
              Scope:  The collaboration brings technical  capabilities from India, as well as
              equipment  provided from Indian sources, to   allow participation with American
              scientists in  the particle physics studies carried out at  Fermilab.  This is
              a unique opportunity for the  Indian participants to work on high energy 
              experiments at one of the world's most powerful  accelerators.  On March 3,
              1995, Fermilab  announced the discovery of the TOP quark by  this group of high
              energy physicists.      ***
