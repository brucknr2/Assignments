Abstract    :
              Proposal # 9421272  Massachusetts Inst. of Technology    The key to effective
              use of environmentally conscious manufacturing (ECM) tools rests both in the
              designing of the tools, and in understanding and designing the organizational
              context in which they are implemented.  Based on previous research at MIT by
              the project team (and by others, elsewhere) on environmental innovation in
              firms, the latter aspect, organizational factors, is believed to be the more
              significant.  Using important new developments that relate information
              technology and innovation, coupled with the team's understanding of the use of
              existing ECM design tools the project will study the adoption, use, and
              exploitation of these tools through a large industry survey and coordinated
              longitudinal studies at our industrial partners' plant.  The participating
              firms, UTC and Motorola, both members of MIT's Leaders for Manufacturing
              program, have begun to use ECM, but not at all facilities.  The situation poses
              unique opportunity to examine different approaches to adoption and use in a
              pretest-post test format.  By employing multiple methodologies, the research
              will produce understanding of both the ECM system and its inner links.  The
              research should:   {SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol"}    Facilitate the adoption of ECM
              design tools   {SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol"}    Improve the use of the tools, and  
              {SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol"}    Provide additional benefits to the firms using
              them.
