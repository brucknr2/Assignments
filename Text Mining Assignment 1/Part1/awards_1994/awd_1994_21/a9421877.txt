Abstract    :
              9421877  Pope       This grant supports a program of research in elementary 
              particle physics with an international collaboration that  studies
              proton-antiproton interactions and properties of the  particles produced in the
              collisions.  The source is the  Fermilab Tevatron colliding-beams accelerator
              complex.  Topics of interest include top quark properties, precision 
              measurement of parameters important for detailed  investigation of the validity
              of the "standard model"  theoretical framework and tests of Quantum
              Chromodynamics.  Included is support for further instrumentation development 
              to improve the capability of detection apparatus.  ***
