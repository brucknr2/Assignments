Abstract    :
              Dr. William J. Evans, Chemistry Department, University of   Califonia-Irvine, is
              supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and   Organometallic Chemistry
              Program of the Chemistry Division to define and   develop new types of
              chemistry and chemical transformations which exploit   the special properties
              of organosamarium(II) and related complexes. The   project's general purpose
              will be to expand the limits of lanthanide   chemistry and to develop new
              reaction and reagents. By utilizing the   tetrahedral reaction cavity which
              exists in decamethylsamarocene, size   selective hydrocarbon reactions such as
              C-H metalations, C-C coupling and   other novel reactions will be developed.
              Using the reducing power of   Sm(II), main group-carbon bonds with energies as
              high as 215 kJ/mol  can   be cleaved. This property will be utilized to produce
              unusual compounds   containing main group clusters. These studies will then be
              extended to a   variety of additional Sm(II) species in order to systematize
              the   chemistry of this oxidation state.  Metal compounds are used to effect
              many chemical transformations. While   the importance of many metals has been
              well established, there is a   group, called the lanthanides, whose chemistry
              is not well developed,   even though tantalizing hints of important behaviors
              have emerged over   the past few years. In this project the ability of a series
              of samarium   compounds to activate hydrocarbons and to break bonds between
              carbon and   other elements will be assessed. This will contribute both to the
              overall   understanding of the lanthanide metals and to the discovery of new
              uses   for samarium, which is an inexpensive metal readily available in the  
              United States.
