Abstract    :
              This research is on techniques and tools for automated logic design  of
              low-power, semi-custom circuits.  Digital circuits are specified  as models in
              hardware description languages that can be readily  compiled into finite-state
              machines.  The latter are described by  transition diagrams or by synchronous
              logic networks.  These models  are then used to solve logic synthesis problems
              in encoding  sequential circuits, restructuring logic networks, and library 
              binding.  Tools for a comprehensive EDA system for low-power design  are being
              developed.
