Abstract    :
                                        ABSTRACT                                  CROTTS,
              Arlin  AST-9421474    Mass loss on the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) is still
              one  of the most poorly understood topics in modern astronomy.  The goal of
              this program is to study, with unprecedented  time resolution, the most recent
              mass loss history and  changes in dust shell morphology of stars in the AGB and
               post-AGB phase.    Utilizing the adaptive optics system at the Starfire
              Optical  Range the investigators will make subarcsec resolution maps  of the
              scattered light from the inner parts of circumstellar  envelopes (CSEs) around
              Miras and post-AGB stars.  The  intensity of scattered light as function of
              angular distance  to the central star maps out the dust density distribution 
              and contains information about recent variations in mass  loss rate and
              morphology.    A better understanding of the AGB mass loss process is not  only
              crucial for a better understanding of the late stages  of stellar evolution,
              but also supports other areas in  astronomy such as the recycling of processed
              material into  interstellar medium and studies of old stellar populations  and
              galactic chemical evolution.  * * *
