Abstract    :
              9421037  Trenary      The metal borides are intriguing materials that are 
              extremely hard, chemically inert, and have very high melting  points. Many of
              these solids have unique properties making  them useful in various
              applications. For example, lanthanum  boride and cerium boride are widely used
              as electrmn  emitting cathodes in a variety of electron optical devices  and
              are far superior to tungsten and other refractory metals  for this purpose.
              High-quality single crystals of yttrium  boride are being developed for use as
              monochromators of 1-2  keV synchrotron radiation. Because of the importance of 
              surface structure and surface properties in thermionic  emission, the
              rare-earth hexaborides have been the subject  of many fundamental surface
              science studies. Yet many of the  most important properties have not been
              investigated. One of  the most important questions in the use of hexaborides as
               cathodes concerns their interaction with the background  gases present in all
              vacuum chambers. In this work,  reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy
              will be used to  characterize the adsorption and decomposition of simple 
              background gases on the lanthanum boride and cerium boride  surfaces. Scanning
              tunneling microscopy also will be used  for structural studies of the number of
              technologically  important metal boride surfaces.  %%%    Little is known about
              the surface chemistry of boron-rich  solids.  These solids constitute a wide
              and varied class of  materials.  They are of high interest to the electronics 
              industry as cathodes for electron beam lithography, and  electron emitting
              cathode in a variety of electron devices.  Furthermore, transition metal
              diborides as thin films in  metal surfaces are important application areas
              requiring  ultra-hard coatings.    ***
