Abstract    :
                        9421852  Young  Funding is provided to partially support the 1995
              International  Conference for Arctic Research Planning that will be convened
              under  the aegis of the International Arctic Science Committee (IASC).   The
              Conference objectives are to identify priority areas for the  IASC agenda and
              to develop a number of focussed scientific  programs that address
              interdisciplinary research topics requiring   circumarctic cooperation within
              this agenda.  Priority program  areas include: 1) Impact of global changes on
              the Arctic regions  and its peoples, 2) Arctic processes of relevance to global
               systems, 3) Natural processes within the Arctic, and 4) Arctic  resource use/
              ecosystem dynamics.  It is envisaged that these  programs will constitute the
              core IASC scientific agenda for the  following five-to-ten years.  The
              Conference will be organized in  a workshop mode.  Opportunities will also be
              provided for  presentations of additional new ideas for Arctic research by 
              scientists having interests in Arctic research, but who are not  presently
              involved in IASC.  This open forum will further assist in  the planning of IASC
              scientific programs.
