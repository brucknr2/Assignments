Abstract    :
              This  award  is  an Accomplishment-Based Renewal  of  a  previous  research
              award on computer systems that perceive and model  their  environment  and take
              actions in that environment to achieve  and  maintain  goals  under management,
              but not detailed  step-by-step  supervision  by humans.  These computer
              systems, which  might  be  robots  or only pieces of software, are called
              autonomous agents.  In   this  research  program,  the  focus  will  be  on 
              reacting  appropriately  to  commonly  occurring situations  (telo-reactive 
              behavior), attention to multiple goals, planning, and learning.
