              Abstract  ATM-9421041  Leavitt, Steven  University of Arizona  Title:  Tree-Ring
              Isotopic Composition as a Proxy for Isotopic  Composition of Paleoprecipitation
              and Paleoclimate in the American  Southwest    This study is intended to define
              relationships between isotopic  composition (delD, del18O, del13C) measured in
              tree-rings with  instrumental climate data and actual isotopic measurements of 
              precipitation.  Stable-isotopic measurements will be made on  cellulose of
              ponderosa pine from southeastern Arizona and southern  New Mexico.  The delD
              and del18O of the trees will be calibrated  with respect to a long record (>12
              years) of isotopic composition  of precipitation from nearby Tucson, extended
              with other  precipitation isotopic data from the IAEA network.  In the long 
              term, the connection between the tree-ring measurements and 
              climate/source-water variables established in this study can be  used to
              explore periods preceding the instrumental period to  determine the spatial and
              temporal variability and strength of  precipitation sources.
