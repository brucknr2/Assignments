Abstract    :
                   We do not understand well the mechanisms underlying the  tactile perception
              of surface texture and object shape.  The  human fingertip is exceptionally
              good at such  discriminations, particularly when it is actively moved over 
              surfaces.  This project utilizes a novel material called a 
              "shape-memory-alloy" which is a metal that can rapidly be  deformed into
              patterns by brief electrical heat pulses.  The  stimulator built with units of
              this material is used to  deliver highly quantified spatial and temporal
              patterns to  an array of 30 elements on the fingertip, to simulate  surface
              roughness and edge detection as though the finger  were sweeping across a
              surface.  Manipulation of frequency,  intensity, and spatial distribution will
              allow quantitative  evaluation of perceptual discrimination, identification,
              and  similarity ratings by subjects, comparing simulated surfaces  with actual
              ones.  Results will be important to relate to  physiologically-based models of
              mechanoreceptor function in  touch sensation, and the perception of texture and
              form.  The potential impact extends beyond mechanosensory  neuroscience into
              the areas of aids for the handicapped, and  tactile feedback for telerobotic
              and virtual environment  applications.
