Abstract    :
              9421065  Nunn   This award provides partial funding (63% of total cost) for the
              acquisition of computer equipment for the Earth Systems Computational and
              Visualization Laboratory in the Department of Geology and Geophysics at the
              Louisiana State University. LSU is committed to providing the remaining funds
              necessary to purchase the equipment. The new equipment consists of a network
              server with large RAM capacity. The Earth Systems Computational and
              Visualization Laboratory at LSU is used by faculty and students for research
              and teaching in the areas of tectonics, seismology, hydrologic sciences,
              chemical oceanography, and marine geology and geophysics.  ***
