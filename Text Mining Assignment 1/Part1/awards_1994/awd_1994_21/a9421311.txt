                                        ABSTRACT                                  BLACK, John 
              AST-9421311    This award supports the use of the US Air Force 1.5m SOR 
              telescope to undertake a range of observational programs in  very high
              resolution stellar spectroscopy in the 0.5-1  micron spectral range.  A Littrow
              echelle spectrograph will  be assembled on the user optical bench, tailored for
               operation with diffraction limited star images.  It consists  simply of two
              units, the image relay, entrance aperture and  CCD detector together at one
              end, and a lens, prism and  grating unit at the other.  The cross dispersed
              spectrum  format will be optimized by using grating with a large  groove
              spacing, so advantage can be taken of the diffraction  limited images to record
              90 orders at once.  The CCD will  have a large format (2048 X 4096 pixels), so
              that full  spectral cover will be possible with only a few exposures.  With
              this instrument, the SOR telescope will be able to  record the very high
              resolution diffraction limited spectra  of fifth magnitude stars, with a
              combination of resolution  (/d = 500,000), signal/noise ratio (100) and full
              cover  never previously obtained.  * * *
