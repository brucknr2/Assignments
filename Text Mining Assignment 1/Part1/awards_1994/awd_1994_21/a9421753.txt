Abstract    :
              9421753  R. Davis    It is proposed to provide partial travel support to ten
              young US researchers and to several invited speakers to an international
              symposium focused on the theory and applications of hydrodynamic diffusion of
              suspended particles.  The meeting will be co-sponsored by the International
              Union of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (IUTAM).  Hydrodynamic diffusion
              refer to the fluctuating motion of particles which in a dispersion due to
              multiparticle interactions.  This phenomenon has received an increased
              attention in the last decade.  This is the first symposium dedicated entirely
              to this subject, with the objective to review the current research, identify
              research trends and new areas  od relevance in applications.  The participants
              are from different research fields, such as rheology, fluidization, granular
              flow, and from a variety of disciplines (physics, applied mathematics,
              chemical, mechanical and civil engineering).  ***
