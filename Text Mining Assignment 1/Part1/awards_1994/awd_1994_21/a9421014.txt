Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  D. T. Leighton  CTS-9421014    It is proposed to partially support the
              organization of the 6th Joint NSF-DOE Workshop on Flow of Particulates and
              Fluid, Philadelphia (PA), October 5-7, 1994.  The purpose of this grantees
              meeting is to bring together NSF and DOE (PETC) grantees, as well as
              researchers from industry, to review relevant projects sponsored by both
              agencies, promote collaborations among different research groups, and review
              future research needs and opportunities. Approximately 50 invited researchers
              from universities, industry and national laboratories are expected to
              participate, including 22 speakers.  The papers presented will include
              experimental, theoretical, and numerical studies in the areas of particulate
              and multiphase flows.  The workshop proceedings will be prepared following the
              meeting, and made available through the National Technical Information Service,
              U.S. Department of  Commerce.  ***
