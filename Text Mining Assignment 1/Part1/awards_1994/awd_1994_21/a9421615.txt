Abstract    :
              Partial oxidation catalysis is an economically important but scientifically
              poorly understood  process.  The elucidation of the mechanism of partial
              oxidation catalysis, particularly the  activation of methane and other alkanes,
              forms the focus of this research project supported by  the Analytical and
              Surface Chemistry Program.  Model reactions carried out on oxygen covered 
              Rh(111) single crystal surfaces are used to probe the mechanism of the partial
              oxidation reaction.   High resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy
              combined with thermal desorption  spectroscopy provide information about the
              mechanism and kinetics of alkane oxidation on the  Rh(111) surface as a
              function of oxygen coverage.  A range of methods for preparing and  examining
              possible radical intermediates in these reactions are employed in the studies.
              A better  understanding of this process could have impact on the design of
              catalysts for utilization of vast  methane energy reserves.    An understanding
              of partial oxidation catalysis, particularly the activation of methane and its 
              conversion to methanol or synthesis gas, could have enormous economic impact
              due to the large  reserves of methane available.  This research project works
              to develop this understanding, by  examining the kinetics and mechanisms of
              appropriate model catalytic systems.
