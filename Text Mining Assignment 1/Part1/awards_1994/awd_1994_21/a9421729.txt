Abstract    :
              9421729  Norberg  This is an historical investigation of the research and
              advocacy of the group of social scientists active in the NAACP litigation
              campaign to desegregate public schools during the late 1940s and early 1950s.
              No study has yet been made of these social scientists and their work. The
              proposal requests funds for travel to examine unpublished manuscript sources of
              Kenneth B. Clark, and the NAACP, deposited at the Library of Congress, and of
              Stuart Cook and other psychologists active in the litigation, all of which are
              deposited at the Archives of History of American Psychology in Akron, Ohio.   
              %%%  Thirty-one prominent social scientists, primarily social psychologists,
              were involved with the NAACP litigation campaign to desegregate public schools
              during the late 1940s and early 1950s.  These social scientists served as
              expert witnesses testifying to the psychological harm of school segregation. 
              Based on their research, they wrote and signed an appendix to the NAACP brief
              to the United States Supreme Court.  In BROWN V. BOARD OF EDUCATION the Court
              cited their works as proof of the harm of school segregation to minority school
              children. This study will investigate the following historical questions:  How
              did these scientists choose to study school desegregation as a scientific
              problem and what were their methods and results?  How did the social scientists
              define for themselves roles as experts in their society?  How did the
              scientists maintain their persona as scientific experts in the highly
              adversarial campaign to desegregate public schools?  In answering these
              questions, the study will lead to a better understanding of (1) how social
              scientists were able to use scientific expertise to create what they viewed as
              a more just society, (2) the role of the ongoing professionalization of
              psychology that set the context for their work, and (3) how society influences
              science.   ***
