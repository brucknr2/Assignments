Abstract    :
              Funds for the proposal will be used for completion of post-conference
              activities, including publication of a volume of invited presentations on
              Global Change and Arctic Terrestrial Ecosystems.  The international conference
              was held on August 21-26, 1993 in Oppdal, Norway.  Since the cessation of the
              International Biological Program of the early 1970's, the arctic reqearch
              community has not maintained an active and effective system of meetings and
              communication.  This meeting represented the first global conference directed
              towards arctic terrestrial ecosystems in 20 years, and was a truly rare
              opportunity for a large, open meeting, involving both Russian and western
              scientists, to evaluate the potential effects and associated feedbacks of
              climate change on the arctic tundra.  The main goal of the conference was to
              foster international cooperation, collaboration, and the exchange of ideas
              among arctic systems scientists.  The proposed book is expected to be an
              authoritative evaluation of the current state of knowledge regarding the
              anticipated effects of global change on arctic ecosystems.  It is anticipated
              that the proceedings of the meeting will lay the foundation for continued
              integration and evaluation of arctic research in relation to global change.
