Abstract    :
              9421859  Greene       This grant supports the JILA Center for Atomic, Molecular 
              and Optical Theory.  The goal is to strengthen the status of  atomic, molecular
              and optical theory in the US by supporting a  new faculty member whose research
              is devoted to atomic, molecular  or optical theory, a named postdoctoral
              fellowship program and a  series of topical workshops on critical problems in
              the area of  atomic, molecular and optical physics.  ***
