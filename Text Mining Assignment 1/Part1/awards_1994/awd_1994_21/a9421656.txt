Abstract    :
              In  modeling scientific discovery.  Over the last several  years,  this  group
              has developed several computer programs that automate  important  aspects of
              scientific discovery in biology, chemistry,  physics,  and  also  general 
              experimental  science.   They  have  identified promising discovery tasks by
              studying primary  sources  such  as  scientific  articles, talking with  a 
              broad  array  of  scientists,  and  even  doing  "field  work"  in  some  
              science.  Automation methods have  included the concepts and techniques  of 
              heuristic   search,  of  algorithms  and  optimization,   and   a  elementary 
              mathematics  and  statistics.   Concrete  results  in  various fields back up
              the hypothesis that a significant fraction  of  scientific  inference  can be 
              automated  today.   There  is,  however,   the  hypothesis  that  mush  of 
              scientific  inference  consists of generic tasks that are quite specific, but
              that -  in  their  computational essence - are common to  multiple  sciences. 
              The  concept  of  generic scientific task is a new  way  to  view  computing in
              biology, computational  chemistry, and so on.   This  research  explore  the
              concept of "generic  scientific  task"  by  investigating  whether  it leads to
              practical  results  (powerful  discovery tools for scientists), and how this
              can provide a  more  systematic understanding os scientific inference.
