Abstract    :
              9421693  Wong         Experiments investigating collapse processes in plasmas 
              under the most general driving sources-electron beams,  electromagnetic waves
              and azimuthal currents will be  investigated.  The experiments probe
              interesting questions  of nonlinear and chaotic behavior in plasmas with an 
              emphasis on the physics of the collapse of cavitons.  The  research as
              applications to ionospheric and astrophysical  phenomena.  ***
