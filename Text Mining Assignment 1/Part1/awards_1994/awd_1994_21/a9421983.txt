Abstract    :
              9421983  Ramoa  Very recently it was discovered that, before the time that the 
              nervous tissue of the eye (the retina) can respond to light, the  nerve cells
              in the eye generate waves of activity that are  transmitted to the cells in the
              eye's central nervous system target  (the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus). 
              Importantly, the waves of  retinal activity are patterned, and they occur
              during a time of  development when the patterns of connections between the eye
              and  the brain are being established and refined.  This research is  designed
              to determine whether these spontaneous waves of activity  contribute to the
              definition of the connection patterns between the  eye and the brain, as well
              as how this activity interacts with  other central nervous system inputs to the
              cells in the dorsal  lateral geniculate nucleus.  It has long been known that
              patterns  of activity generated by light stimuli play an important role in 
              visual system development.  This research will provide important  information
              about how intrinsic, spontaneous activity contributes  to specifying the
              connectivity in the central nervous system.
