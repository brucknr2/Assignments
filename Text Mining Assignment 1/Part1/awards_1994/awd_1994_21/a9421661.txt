Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9421661    An experimental investigation and corresponding
              theoretical studies of gas-particle suspension flow in vertical pipes will be
              undertaken.  Particle concentration and velocity distributions will be measured
              in the pipe cross-section using the techniques of electrical capacitance
              tomography (ECT).  The concentration fluctuations and their spatial will be
              measured and spatially correlated.  A twin-plane system will allow to obtain
              the particle velocity from the cross-correlation of concentration fluctuations.
               The results will be used to improved basic understanding of the two-phase flow
              phenomena and calibrate numerical simulations.  The research has relevance to
              the design and operation of fluidized beds, pneumatic transport, silos, solid
              feed hoppers, and other equipment in particle processing industries.  ***
