Abstract    :
              9421969  Celik-Bulter  The principal investigators will explore the
              non-superconducting phases of YBa2Cu3Ox thin films for uncooled infrared 
              detection applications.  The long term goal is to build thermal imaging arrays
              on micromachined silicon structures with high thermal isolation and therefore
              high responsivity.  This would enable the fabrication of integrated circuits
              where radiation detection and signal processing are performed on the same chip.
               These infrared detectors will utilize the oxygen deficient phase of
              YBa2Cu3Ox(x=6) and will be operated at or near room temperature.  Two different
              thin film, thermal detector structures will be tried: semiconductor bolometers
              and pyroelectric capacitors.  The bolometers will be made of semiconducting
              YBa2Cu3Ox on SiO2 or Si3N4 and exhibit a high rate of resistance change with
              temperature dR/dT.       The significance of the proposed research lies in the
              fact that proposed detectors operators at room temperature without
              refrigeration.  They are relatively easy and inexpensive to fabricate and
              compatible with silicon technology since they can be deposited at ambient
              temperature by rf sputtering.  It is projected that the proposed research will
              lead to a better understanding of  the electronic properties of
              nonsuperconducting YBa2Cu3Ox and their dependence upon oxygen stoichiometry. 
              This proposal will be also be the first time where Yba2Cu3Ox IR detectors will
              be fabricated on air-gap bridge structures.  Since the proposed devices do not
              require cooling for operation and can be fabricated using inexpensive
              techniques and materials, it will be less costly for defense applications and
              more suitable for civilian needs such as night-time navigation, security or
              biomedical thermal imaging.  Their cryogenic counterparts, superconducting
              bolometers and HgCdTe photovoltaic or photoconductive devices are expensive to
              fabricate costly to operate.    The proposed research will be in collaboration
              with Texas Instruments Inc. and University of North Texas.  ***
