Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Facilities Program will
              help the  Department of Chemistry at the University of Oregon at Eugene
              purchase a 300 MHz  spectrometer which will be used in the following research
              investigations:    Structural studies of organic molecules biological
              relevance, inorganic complexes pertinent as  models for magnetic materials and
              catalysts, and solid state inorganic materials of technological  interest.   
              Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
              available to  chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules.  It
              is used to identify unknown  substances, characterize specific arrangements of
              atoms within molecules, and to study the  dynamics of interactions between
              molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR  spectrometry is
              essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.  The results from
               these NMR studies are useful in the areas such as polymers and catalysis, and
              in biology.
