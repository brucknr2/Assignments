Abstract    :
              In this project funded by the Divisions of Chemistry and Materials   Research,
              Koel will perform multidisciplinary studies to synthesize new   fulleride and
              superfulleride compounds using a molecular approach and to   determine the
              physical and chemical properties of these materials.  The   conditions of vapor
              deposition of the precursors will be controlled on an   atomic level, and the
              compounds formed will be studied using   photoelectron and electron-loss
              spectroscopies.  Thin films of   metal-containing superfullerides will be
              synthesized to search for   systematic trends in electronic and possibly
              superconducting properties   of metal-doped C60.    %%%  This work will provide
              a scientific basis for designing new synthetic   procedures and
              structure-property relationships for this intriguing class   of materials. 
              Fullerene thin films have applications in areas such as   diamond growth,
              superconductivity, and the catalysis of hydrogen-transfer   reactions.
