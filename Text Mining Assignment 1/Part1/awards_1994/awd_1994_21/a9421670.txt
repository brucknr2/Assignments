Abstract    :
                The focus of computational geometry is designing   for  solving geometric
              problems.  These arise in a number of    contexts, such as graphics, robotics,
              medical  imaging, and   manufacturing.  The  project's concentrations touch  on
              all these application   areas.  A number of  visibility questions  are being
              examined, including covering   regions with  floodlights,  and the structure of
              visibility graphs.    Several of the  problems being explored involve three
              dimensions:    reconstruction  from parallel  slices (and its application to
              graphics morphing),  computing   diameters and  centerpoints of sets (with
              applications  to pattern   recognition), and motion  planning configuration
              spaces  (application to robotics).    Fundamental questions  in the theory  of
              arrangements are being addressed.  Several   problems arising from  the
              manufacturing community are being tackled, including that   of  scheduling a 
              punching tool to create a hole in a sheet of metal  of a   prescribed shape. 
              Female undergraduate students are engaged in all aspects of    the research, 
              and several useful software packages are being  produced and   distributed.
