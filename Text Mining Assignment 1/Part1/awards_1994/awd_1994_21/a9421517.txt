Abstract    :
              9421517  Gibbs  This is a renewal proposal for Lightwave Technology research on 
              semiconductor physics and photonics.  The approach is to grow III-V 
              semiconductor heterostructures using a Riber MBE machine, where  appropriate to
              fabricate them into devices by photolithography and  reactive ion etching, and
              to study their optical properties by  linear and nonlinear optical
              spectroscopies including femtosecond  dynamics and high magnetic fields.  The
              proposal concentrates on  topics in four areas:  vertical-cavity
              surface-emitting lasers  (VCSEL's); nonlinear optical materials, nonlinear
              optical switches;  and Er-doped semiconductors.  The first three areas are
              extensions  of research under the current grant, whereas the fourth is a new 
              direction.  ***
