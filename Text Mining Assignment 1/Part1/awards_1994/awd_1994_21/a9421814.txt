Abstract    :
              A belt of streamers extending from a band encircling the sun  comprise the
              densest portion of the solar corona.  Recent research  indicates, contrary to
              superposed epoch analysis of streamer belt  data near Earth, this belt may be
              the source of coronal mass  ejections (CMEs), which are responsible for
              geomagnetic storms.   Data shows high variability, consistent with its activity
              in the  heliosphere, yet few studies have focused on its complexities.   This
              project's aim, at both basic and applied levels, is to (1)  construct a
              morphological model of the streamer belt, and (2)  establish a prediction
              scheme for geomagnetic storms.  The  investigator will draw from combined field
              and plasma parameter  streamline constants, and analyze them to separate
              dynamic  interplanetary effects from those of solar origin.  The resulting 
              streamer belt morphology data will serve as a basis for any future 
              quantitative streamer belt module of a global circulation model of  the
              heliosphere.***
