Abstract    :
              A workshop on the general topic of Coordination Theory and  Collaboration
              Technology whose purpose is to examine current trends  and new directions in
              this broad area.  The workshop will be held  in Ann Arbor, Michigan from
              November 18-20, 1994.  The 30  scientists invited to the workshop will be drawn
              from the former  CTCT NSF grantee community and from those outside the NSF
              family of  CTCT grantees who are leading thinkers and researchers who could 
              help explore and define new directions in this area.
