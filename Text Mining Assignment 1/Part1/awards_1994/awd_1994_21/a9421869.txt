Abstract    :
              9421869  Lewis-Beck    Comparison of voting models across advanced democracies
              is  hampered by a number of things, among them difference in method, 
              measurement, and theory.  Franco-American election studies share  in common a
              survey research methodology, but tend to be separated  by differences of
              measurement and theory.  The respective  national election surveys do not pose
              many of the same questions  and the dominant research paradigms in each country
              offer  opposing explanatory models of vote choice.    This project, a joint
              effort of US and French researchers,  includes, for the first time, key
              American National Election  Study (ANES) items in the French National Election
              Study (for  1995).  Following on an analysis of new French pre-test data, 
              these ANES items will be included:  feeling thermometers,  approval ratings,
              economic evaluations, seven-point proximity  measures on social issues, party
              identification, candidate  traits.    Similarly, this project will include,
              again for the first time,  key French National Election Study (FNES) items into
              ANES (for  1996).  These items will be subject to American pre-test, thus 
              paralleling the above French pre-test.  The items are:  left-  right
              ideological measures, nonstandard social class measures (in  particular, a
              social status "staircase" indicator, and indicators  of property ownership).   
              The end result will be unique:  two presidential election surveys  - - 1995 for
              France, 1996 for the US - - that contain comparable  measures on key
              independent variables.  These data sets, which  will be made available to the
              scholarly community through the  Interuniversity Consortium for Political and
              Social Research,  will enable unprecedented cross-cultural testing of rival 
              theories of vote choice.  ***
