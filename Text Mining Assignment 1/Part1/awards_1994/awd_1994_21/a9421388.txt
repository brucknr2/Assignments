Abstract    :
              9421388  Laurence Abbott    The  nervous  system  uses electrical spike trains 
              to  transport  information  that  is  converted into  actions  at  the 
              synapses  between  motor neurons and muscles. A wide variety  of  different 
              patterns of the neuronal spike trains arrive at the neuromuscular  junction 
              and  are converted by the muscle into an  equally  wide  range  of muscle
              contractions. These investigators would like  to  understand  this transduction
              process and determine  what  effect  changes  in  the output of the motor
              neuron have  on  the  muscle  response. To do this they will construct a
              mathematical formalism  that  allows  them to predict the response of the
              muscle  to  any  spike  train.  The prediction will be made by linear 
              integration  kernels  and  mathematical neural networks using  learning  rules 
              that  improve  the performance of the system over  time  while  a  variety  of 
              spike  trains  are  delivered  to  the  muscle.  The  resulting  network  will
              then be able to predict  the  effect  of  novel  spike  trains. In addition,
              the form  of  the  model  will  provide  important  information about the 
              biophysical  processes  underlying the synaptic transduction. The techniques
              that will be  developed can then be applied to synapses between neurons  within
               the  nervous system as well as those between neurons and muscles.  This  work
              will have an important impact on our understanding  of  how the brain processes
              stimuli from the environment and converts  them into a resultant behavior.
