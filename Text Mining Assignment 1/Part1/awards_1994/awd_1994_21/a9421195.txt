Abstract    :
              Dr. Lindzen will continue research on a variety of topics in  dynamic
              meteorology, climate dynamics, and geophysical fluid  dynamics.  Specifically,
              he will (1) examine the roles of potential  vorticity mixing in conjunction
              with radiative forcing and Hadley  circulation dynamics in determining the
              atmosphere's meridional  temperature distribution; (2) further explore the role
              of  gravitational tides on the outer planets; (3) expand a study of   this
              process in the Milankovich mechanism; (4) continue studies of  the upper
              tropospheric water vapor budget and its parameterization;  (5) investigate the
              stationary waves that were forced by the major  ice sheets during the last
              glaciation and their role in observed  rapid climate changes;  (6) study the
              nonlinear accommodation of a  fluid to the saturation of Rossby waves when
              their enstrophy  exceeds the available mean enstrophy; (7) study the excitation
              of  radiating wave packets by the Orr mechanism; and (8) determine  whether
              barotropic stabilization accounts for the supercritical  equilibration of
              two-level monlinear models of baroclinically  unstable flows.  The water vapor
              studies will be conducted in  collaboration with scientists from the Center for
              Ocean-Land-  Atmosphere Interaction (COLA) and COLA GCM; the other studies will
               be conducted mechanistic models of varying complexity.       All of these
              studies will contribute to better understanding  of the basic physics of
              weather and climate and the dynamics of  planetary atmospheres.   The water
              vapor studies will contribute to  the goals of the Role of Clouds, Energy, and
              Water in Global  Climate Change Program.
