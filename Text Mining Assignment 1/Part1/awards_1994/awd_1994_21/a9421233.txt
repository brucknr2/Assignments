Abstract    :
              9421233  Turrigiano    The ability of animals to learn and remember arises from
              the nervous system. To learn and remember the properties of the neural circuits
              within the nervous system are modified with experience.  These
              experience-dependent modifications include modifications in both the intrinsic
              properties of individual neurons and the properties of the synaptic connections
              between neurons. Models of learning have stressed almost exclusively the role
              of synaptic modifications in encoding experience, but recent work has shown
              that experience, in the form of activity in the presynaptic neurons, can
              profoundly alter the intrinsic firing properties of neurons. This finding
              identifies an additional powerful mechanisms by which activity can shape neural
              circuit output. The goal of this work is to determine the mechanisms by which
              activity regulates intrinsic neuronal firing properties and to ask how this
              regulation is coordinated with the regulation of synaptic properties to encode
              experience. This will lead us to a better understanding of how we learn and how
              we remember.
