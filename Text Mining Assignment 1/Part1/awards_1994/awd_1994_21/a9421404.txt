Abstract    :
                9421404                                 ABSTRACT         Recent developments
              In linguistic theory have led to a  reconsideration of the nature and role of
              optimality  considerations in the overall architecture of grammar. Emerging 
              from this research is the idea that different components of  grammar interact
              to yield the best choice from a set of canidates.       This idea departs from
              more traditional approaches to the output of  linguistic levels in generative
              grammar, by which rules, principles  and constraints interact to determine the
              grammatical status of each  linguistic object independent of the status of
              possible competitors.         In the past year or two, interest in the
              linguistic role of  optimality has been sparked by the sharpened notions of
              "economy"  in Chomsky's Minimalist Program and by Prince and Smolensky's 
              Optimality Theory, originally developed for phonology. As work on  these
              notions has explored new analytic possibilities, many  questions have arisen.
              These include new versions of an old  debate between constraints on derivations
              and constraints on  representations, and entirely new questions about the
              nature of  the candidate set, in addition to complex and as yet imperfectly 
              formulated questions about learnability and computability.         These sorts
              of questions are coming to occupy a center stage  in current debate.
              Nonetheless, the questions have not been  systematically discussed, either in
              print or in a public  workshop. Therefore, a workshop addressing these issues
              will  convene at MIT May 19-21, 1995.  The explicit aim of the workshop  is to
              compare approaches and define questions for further  research. The discussion
              will be as focused as possible, in the  hope that genuine scientific progress
              can be made during the  three days of the conference.
