Abstract    :
              9421657  Sidell  For approximately the last 40 million years, a unique fish
              fauna  has been evolving in the frigid seas surrounding Antarctica.  
              Physiological function of these water-breathing animals has  demanded many
              adaptations to ensure proper metabolism and  regulation of biochemical
              processes at cell temperatures of about  OoC.  Among the polar fishes, one
              family is particularly unusual,  the Channichthyid icefishes.  Species in this
              family lack  hemoglobin in their circulating blood and, at least the majority, 
              do not possess the intracellular respiratory protein, myoglobin,  that is
              normally responsible for enhancing movement of oxygen  through aerobic muscle
              tissues.  The PI's have recently  found  two species of icefish,
              Pseudochaenichthys georgianus and  Chionodraco rastrospinosus, however, that
              express myoglobin, but  only in one tissue - heart ventricle.  The metabolism
              of all  icefish species is highly aerobic and is based largely on the 
              combustion of fatty fuels as energy sources.  The field work will  consist of a
              combination of trawling from R/V Polar Duke to  capture icefish species and
              laboratory work at Palmer Station  using tissues from these animals.  At Palmer
              Station they will  conduct experiments and prepare purified, fixed and or
              frozen  material for shipment back to our CONUS laboratory for further 
              analyses.  Our overall goals are: 1) to test whether to determine  myoglobin
              protein remains physiologically significant at the cold  body temperatures of
              Antarctic fishes, 2) to reconstruct the  evolution of the myoglobin gene within
              the icefish family and, 3)  to identify the mechanisms controlling expression
              of myoglobin  within icefish and related species.
