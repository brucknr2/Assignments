Abstract    :
              9421069  Mossberg       This proposal is for, "Experimental Quantum Optics".  It
               calls for a wide ranging experimental effort to explore several  areas of
              current and fundamental interest in the field of quantum  optics.  It proposes
              using driven, cavity-confined, Ba atoms to  study the effect of a driving field
              on spontaneous radiative  decay.  Laser action will be studied in a special
              cavity which  puts a large fraction of all spontaneous radiative decay into the
               laser mode.  Finally, the proposal call for characterization of a  new type of
              quantum-optical, dielectric cavity consisting of  glass bubbles in order to
              study strong atom-cavity interactions.  ***
