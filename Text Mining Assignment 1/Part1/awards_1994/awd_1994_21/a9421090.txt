Abstract    :
              Professor Robert E. Wyatt at the Department of Chemistry, University of   Texas
              at Austin, is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational
              Chemistry Program at NSF for theoretical studies of the   spectra, dynamics,
              and reactions of small polyatomic molecules. The work   supported under this
              grant is specifically concerned with spectroscopy   and with time-dependent
              vibrational dynamics; it is divided into three   main topics. First, there is
              the study of the high energy vibrational   spectra and dynamics of three
              representative molecules. Second, new   mathematical and computational methods
              are being developed for the   efficient treatment of the challenging
              computations which occur in the   first topic. In the third topic, research is
              being carried out on new   theoretical methods which are required in order to
              be able to study very   large molecular systems. The common theme which links
              the various parts   of the work being carried out under this grant is to obtain
              information   about and understanding of the time, spatial, and energetic
              aspects of   the evolution of vibrationally excited states.  The dynamical
              properties and the spectra of molecules are consequences of   the way in which
              the electrons and the nuclei which compose the molecule   interact with each
              other. A goal of the supported research is to learn   how information about
              these fundamental interactions can be extracted   from a knowledge of the
              molecular dynamics and spectra.
