Abstract    :
              In this project, part of the joint ONR/NSF Program on Interfaces to  
              Superconductors and supported by the Divisions of Chemistry, Materials  
              Research, and Electrical and Communications Systems, Professors Chang and  
              Marks of Northwestern University are studying the properties of   interfacial
              growth regions between films of high-temperature   superconducting (HTS)
              materials and insulating metal oxides.  Atomic   layer epitaxy (ALE) will be
              employed using a pulsed organometallic beam   epitaxy system which is capable
              of growing metal oxide films with atomic   layer precision but is also
              adaptable to large-scale low-temperature   conformable metal oxide films growth
              as required in manufacturing.    Superconductor/insulator heterostructures will
              be investigated under a   variety of growth conditions and microstructures and
              interdiffusion   properties will be evaluated by a variety of physical
              techniques,   including various electron and atomic-force microscopies. 
              Surface   chemical processes will be directly monitored as a function of growth
                conditions during ALE.  Improving the nature of interfaces in
              high-temperature superconducting   materials and insulating metal oxides is a
              crucial barrier which must be   surmounted before HTS materials can be
              successfully incorporated on a   large scale into electronic device
              technologies.  This study will provide   the information needed to fabricate
              key structures for HTS-based   electronics and an accurate evaluation of the
              potential of different   growth techniques in this arena.
