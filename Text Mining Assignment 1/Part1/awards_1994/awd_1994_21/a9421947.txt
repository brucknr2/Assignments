Abstract    :
              9421947  Eom    The specific research tasks for the NSF include: (1) 
              investigation of various isotropic metallic oxides, both non 
              copper-oxide-based isotropic metallic oxides and a new  family of
              copper-oxide-based isotropic metallic oxides  (these metallic oxides can be
              applied in many other devices,  and electrodes in electro-optic devices), (2)
              the  fabrication of  superconductor-normal metal-superconductor  epitaxial
              heterostructures with various isotropic metallic  oxides and characterization
              of their interfaces, (3)  investigation of the origin of interface resistance
              between  normal metal barriers and superconductors.  Junction  properties such
              as critical current and junction resistance  will be measured for both planar
              and sandwich type  junctions.  Normal metal barriers of various metallic oxides
               with a wide range of structural, electrical, chemical and  magnetic properties
              will be used to control the interface  properties between high Tc
              superconductors and the normal  metal barriers.  ***
