Abstract    :
              9421997  Hatcher     This award is to purchase a cluster of 24 100MHz i486
              systems connected via both an Ethernet and an ATM network constructed from 3
              12-port ATM switches. Each i486 system will have sufficient main memory to
              allow large parallel computations to be run on the cluster and sufficient disk
              space to allow parallel I/O experiments to be performed. This equipment will be
              dedicated to supporting research in computer and information science and
              engineering.  The equipment will be used for several research projects,
              including in particular: the implementation of data-parallel programs on
              clusters of high-speed processors utilizing a dedicated high-bandwidth network;
              the design, implementation and evaluation of extensions to the data-parallel
              programming model to support parallel I/O; the parallel implementation of the
              UNH Flexidesc system, which integrates scientific data visualization and
              database technology to support exploratory analysis of scientific data; the
              development of parallel algorithms for graphics and data visualization; the
              development of parallel algorithms for solving constraint satisfaction
              problems.  ***
