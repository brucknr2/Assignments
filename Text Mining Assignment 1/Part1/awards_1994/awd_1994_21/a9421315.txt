Abstract    :
                  Shupert  9421315    In order to understand how the brain controls movement,
              it is necessary to understand how different components of the body are
              maintained in a given posture, or changed in a coordinated fashion.  With this
              award, Dr. Charlotte Shupert will conduct detailed studies of how the stability
              of the head and the eyes are maintained  when a person makes postural
              adjustments.  This stability is important so that visual and inner ear feedback
              can be used effectively during such postural adjustments -- but how that
              stability is achieved has not been clear.  The insights gained from this study
              will advance the understanding of biological motor control generally, and will
              provide specific information to enhance work on human motor performance and
              perhaps the design of robotic agents.  ***
