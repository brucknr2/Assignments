Abstract    :
              This research is on defining requirements for computer aided design  of
              electro-optical information processing systems.  Three steps are  being
              pursued.  First, define levels of abstraction for electro-  optical systems,
              analogous to the behavioral, structural,  electrical and physical abstraction
              levels of VLSI design.  Second,  characterize functional, physical and
              parametric models necessary  to analyze designs at different levels of
              abstraction.  Third,  specify requirements for a multi-level simulation system.
