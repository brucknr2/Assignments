Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry   Division,
              Prof. Robert A. Bernheim of the Chemistry Department of the   Pennsylvania
              State University  will study the electronic state and   spectroscopic
              properties of those states of the lithium diatomic molecule   that exhibit
              double-minima or shelf-like structure in their potential   curves.  Under
              certain conditions the transition moments for shelf- and   double-minimum
              states are predicted to be very large with strong and   unusual dependence on
              internuclear separation.  The lithium diatomic   molecule is a testing ground
              for these and other predicted properties   since it offers a rich variety of
              accessible spectroscopic states.  This research deals with an experimental
              investigation of unusual   spectroscopic and structural behaviors predicted 
              theoretically for   diatomic molecules.  The results of these studies will
              provide new data   that are necessary for the verification, and possible
              application to   larger molecular systems , of the quantum theory of molecular
              states and   behavior.
