Abstract    :
              9421709  Posakony  The long-term goal of this research is to understand how
              cells in  the ectoderm layer of the body are directed to become neurons  (cells
              of the nervous system) instead of epidermal (skin) cells.   In insects, a small
              group of genes called "proneural" genes have  been identified as the major
              determinants of a cell's potential to  become part of the nervous system. 
              These genes specify the  synthesis of regulatory proteins that control the
              activity of other  genes.  Very similar "proneural" genes have been identified
              in  mammals (including humans), where they also control nervous system 
              development.  In this project, the peripheral (sensory) nervous  system of an
              insect will be used as a model to investigate, at the  molecular level, how the
              expression of the proneural genes is  controlled, and how the protein products
              of these genes act to  confer on cells the competence to become neurons.  The
              results of  this research will provide fundamental information about the 
              mechanisms that control the development of individual cells in the  nervous
              system.  ^Z^Z
