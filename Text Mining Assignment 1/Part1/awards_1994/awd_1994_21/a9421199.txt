Abstract    :
              9421199  McCune    The dominant epiphytes in old-growth forests develop very
              slowly, thus epiphyte communities differ greatly between old-growth forests and
              young forests (<150 years old).  This study evaluates three alternative, but
              not mutually exclusive, explanations for the slow development of old-growth
              associated epiphytes:  (1) old-growth epiphytes demand the particular
              microclimate created by the structure of old forests, (2) old-growth epiphytes
              are dispersal limited; i.e., suitable habitats are underused by epiphytes
              because of poor dispersal abilities, and (3) colonization is slow because of a
              shortage of suitable substrates in young forests.  These objectives will be met
              by two experiments:  a growth experiment based on transplanted individuals, and
              a dispersal/establishment experiment based on artificially sowing propagules
              onto different substrates in contrasting environments.    This proposed work
              will not only make a contribution to the basic science of epiphytes, it also
              has great potential to influence forest management.  Management options greatly
              expanded in 1993 because of the move away from clearcutting to "green-tree
              retention" cutting.  Forest managers urgently need information from ecologists
              on the consequences of alternative densities and spatial arrangements of
              remnant trees.  The alternative outcomes will influence not just epiphytes, but
              all of the other ecosystem components that depend on epiphytes, either for
              food, mineral nutrition, nesting materials, or habitat.
