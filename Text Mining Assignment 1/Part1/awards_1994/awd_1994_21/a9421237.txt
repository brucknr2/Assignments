Abstract    :
              9421237  Lensky   Microorganisms perform various ecological functions that may
              be either beneficial (e.g., decomposition of wastes) or deleterious (e.g.,
              pathogens of humans and crops), depending on the particular species and
              environmental context.  Much is known about the biochemistry and molecular
              genetics of certain microorganisms,  but very little is known about the
              population dynamics of microorganisms and how various ecological and genetic
              factors affect microbial evolution.  The  proposed research seeks to identify
              and quantify important ecological and genetic processes that may influence the
              dynamics of microbial populations.  There are two major objectives  (1) To
              model mathematically the dynamics of host-pathogen interactions in order to
              understand the ecological and evolutionary forces that shape virulence,
              especially in relation to specific modes of pathogen transmission and  (2) To
              quantify experimentally the genetic variation in bacterial populations for such
              important phenotypic traits as competitiveness and  cell size, including the
              contribution of deleterious mutations, substitution of favorable mutations, and
              balanced polymorphisms to this variation.
