Abstract    :
              9421481  Wharton  An invitational workshop focusing on the environmental
              management  of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in the McMurdo Dry Valleys 
              of Antarctica will be held March 14-17, 1995 in Santa Fe, New  Mexico.  The
              purpose of the workshop is to bring together 30-40  scientists with expertise
              in the Antarctic and comparable  ecosystems in Arctic and temperate regions to
              discuss the  approaches to management of the McMurdo Dry Valleys in an 
              environmentally responsible manner.  Workshop discussions will  encompass the
              conduct of research, environmental monitoring, and  potential effects of
              tourism.  The impetus for holding this  workshop includes:  (1) assessing the
              potential environmental  impact of the on-going research programs in the dry
              valleys, (2)  the current ratification process for the Environmental Protocols 
              of the Antarctic Treaty System, and (3) the arrival in 1992 of  the first
              tourists to visit the McMurdo Dry Valleys.  The major  objectives of the
              workshop will be to develop: (1) an ecosystem-  based approach for managing the
              conduct of scientific activities  in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, (2) a code of
              environmental conduct  for scientists working in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, (3) 
              recommendations for an environmental monitoring program,  including suitable
              indicators, that can address project specific  impacts and cumulative impacts,
              and (4) recommendations for  management plans for regions within the dry
              valleys or for the  McMurdo Dry Valleys as a whole.  In addition to scientists
              from  the United States, numerous foreign scientists will be invited.     The
              workshop will be structured to allow participants an  opportunity to provide
              input and discussion on each topic.  A  report will be published and
              distributed following the workshop.
