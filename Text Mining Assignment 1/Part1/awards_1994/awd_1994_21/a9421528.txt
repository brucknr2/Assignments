Abstract    :
                   Drs. Randall and Fowler, in cooperation with scientists from  the National
              Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), will organize  and conduct a three day
              workshop on prognostic cloud water  representation in general circulation
              models (GCMs) in May 1995 in  support a numerous U.S. and international
              research programs.   Participants will be experts from around the world who are
              working  on the problem of how to incorporate the effects of cloud 
              microphysical processes in global forecast and climate models.   Plans include
              production of a Workshop Proceedings.  The purpose of  this award is to provide
              funds for travel support primarily for  U.S. academic community scientists. 
              Other support will be provided  through NCAR, NASA, and the World
              Meteorological Organization.       The topic is one of the most challenging and
              important  problems facing the global change and weather forecast modeling 
              communities.
