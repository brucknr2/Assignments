Abstract    :
              Proposal # 9421287  Carnegie Mellon University    The success of green products
              in the marketplace depends crucially on all stakeholders enjoying incentives. 
              For that, all parties in the value chain - manufactures, wholesalers,
              transporters, retailers and consumers - should find green products attractive,
              with benefits exceeding costs.  The goal of the study is to develop and test a
              framework that will permit green products designers to evaluate alternative
              packaging strategies from the perspective of all elements of the value chain. 
              The framework developed in this proposed study will integrate methodologies
              from accountings, marketing, engineering and operation management.  A workbench
              incorporating this framework will be tested using real production and market
              data on repackaged products.    The manufactures of consumer products --
              Eastman Kodak and Dow Brands, and a major retailer -- Giant Eagle are partners
              in the study.  The investigative team consists of Carnegie Mellon's faculty
              both from the business and engineering schools.  The methodology of this study
              should  yield a tool for developing "win-win" green product design strategies
              and increase the market success of green products.  The project, besides
              providing a rigorous framework for the practitioners to evaluate and increase
              the success potential of green products, is also expected to be reported in
              major academic publications, and incorporated into seminars and courses in
              business and engineering schools' curricula.
