Abstract    :
              9421773  Wiley  This project is on research better  understand the dynamics of
              growth  factors and their receptors,  focusing on the epidermal growth  factor
              system.  The object of the  work is to manipulate growth factor  ligands as a
              means of altering  trafficking.  There are three  specific aims for the period
              of  study: (1) to manipulate parameters  in receptors/ligand and  receptor/cell
              interactions in order  to test previously constructed  models of receptor
              dynamics; (2) to  investigate ligand transport  through model tissues; and (3)
              to  study model autocrine/paracrine  regulatory systems created by  inserting
              engineered ligands and  regulatory elements into cell  lines.  The
              understanding of growth  factor/receptor dynamics and  trafficking could lead
              to  improvements in wound healing, drug  delivery, gene therapy, and tissue 
              regeneration.  ***
