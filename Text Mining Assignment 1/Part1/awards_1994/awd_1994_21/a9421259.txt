Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    McAlister, Harold  AST-9421259    Support is being provided to carry
              out a program of high spatial resolution studies of selected groups of binary
              stars using the adaptive optics system of the 1.%m telescope at the U.S. Air
              Force Starfire Optical Range located on Kirtland Air Force Base near
              Albuquerque, New Mexico.  The unique capabilities of the Starfire adaptive
              optics system provide the opportunity for directly imaging binaries with
              angular separations as small as 0.1 arcsecond.  This will permit the accurate
              measurement of differential magnitudes and colors for hundreds of binary stars
              in a regime of angular separation never before available to such studies.  * *
