Abstract    :
              9421697  Tobet  This project is based on the central theme of understanding the 
              sexual differentiation of brain structures. The preoptic area and  anterior
              hypothalamus (POA/AH) comprise a region in the brain where  there are many sex
              differences in cell distribution. Experiments  will be conducted to examine how
              sex-specific subgroups begin to  organize in the brain. Three basic questions
              will be addressed.   First, studies will ask whether the cells in the POA/AH
              utilize  cues from the orientation of glial guidance fibers for directed 
              movement, and whether the patterns of migration change during  development. 
              Second, studies will ask where cells in the POA/AH  come from, testing whether
              some cells migrate to the POA/AH after  their birth in zones outside the
              POA/AH.  Finally, the  investigations will determine whether there are sex
              differences in  cell migration. The experiments will utilize time-lapse live
              video  microscopy to observe cell movement in vitro. Additionally, cells  will
              be identified based on birthdate or the presence of specific  proteins. Changes
              in the position of identified cells at different  ages, relative to the
              orientation of glial guidance fibers, will be  measured to provide a parallel
              index of cell migration. Information  leading to discerning how the exquisitely
              complex preoptic area and  hypothalamus develop and function normally will
              provide a new depth  of understanding for a host of issues ranging from
              infertility to  behavior.
