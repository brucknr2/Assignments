Abstract    :
              9421438  Schacher  During the process of development in the neuromuscular
              system,  elaborate connections are made that, as maturation proceeds, are 
              decreased in number and refined.  The mechanisms that control the  elimination
              of some connections, while maintaining others, are only  poorly understood.  In
              this research, a novel method of  investigating these mechanisms will be
              performed.  Cells from both  the developing nervous and muscular systems of an
              invertebrate will  be grown in culture and the levels of a cellular adhesion
              molecule,  thought to be involved in the elimination of connections, will be 
              modulated.  If a decrease in level of the molecule affects the  stability of
              connections between neurons and muscle cells, that  will provide direct
              evidence of its involvement in this process  and, further, provide fundamental
              insight into the mechanisms that  control neuromuscular development.
