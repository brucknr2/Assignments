Abstract    :
              9421030  Dracup     The three primary objectives of this research are as
              follows:   1) To develop a long range tool, one that will predict streamflow
              and drought six to        twelve months in advance.   2) To investigate the
              connection between climatic variations and regional hydrologic                 
                  processes and, in support of this, to identify regions that respond
              specifically to         ENSO events.   3)  To assemble, with the assistance of
              international collaborators, a Pacific Rim             streamflow and drought
              indice data set.  The research plan and methods can be summarized as follows:  
              1)  With the cooperation of several Pacific Rim researchers, to compile a
              streamflow           and drought indice data set that is the basis of this
              research effort and which will be          made available to the public.   2) 
              To use the statistical methods of harmonic analysis and spatial cross
              correlation         analysis in identifying regions of coherent response to
              ENSO.   3)  To quantify the ENSO impact by evaluating the shift in the
              probability distributions of         of La Nina, Non-Enso, and El Nino events. 
              Boxplots will represent the 10th, 30th,            50th, 70th, and 90th
              percentile values of each distribution.   4)  To develop streamflow and drought
              prediction models based on fuzzy concepts, one        model to be based on
              fuzzy rules, the other on fuzzy regression.  The fuzzy ruled-        based
              model can be viewed as the prediction of a hydrologic variable condition       
              upon atmospheric circulation patterns.   5)  To apply the prediction models to
              the western U.S.  The time period of 1948-1988 will         be used for
              calibration and verification of the models, and these models will then be      
               applied to the other relevant regions of the Pacific Rim.  Modifications will
              be made to         reflect the regional atmospheric conditions.  The
              significance of this research will be its major contribution to long range
              prediction of streamflow and drought.  Current streamf low forecasting
              techniques rely on known precipitation quantities and are limited to forecasts
              of three to six months in advance.  This proposed research relies on large
              scale circulation patterns that occur six to eight months in advance of a
              streamflow or drought.  Their use may make possible predictions that could be
              given as much as a year in advance.  Secondly, a unique data base that will
              support future research, far beyond that included within this proposal, will be
              assembled and available.  Finally, the work of international collaboration will
              not only forge new international research links, as large data gaps are being
              filled in, but the possibility remains of conducting further research using
              this group of international collaborators as a base.
