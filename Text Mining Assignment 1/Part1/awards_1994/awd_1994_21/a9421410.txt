Abstract    :
                   This project aims at describing and explaining the morpho-  syntactic
              changes of Chinese from the third century A.D. to the  present. The
              investigators have examined a large number of texts,  selecting at least one
              appropriate item best representing the  vernacular language for each century
              from the third century A.D.  to the present, and have carried out preliminary
              investigation  into the diachronic change of a number of morpho-syntactic 
              structures. A total of twenty-three texts have been chosen, and  they
              constitute the source of empirical data for the project.       On the basis of
              the empirical data from the selected  vernacular texts, the PIs will describe
              the diachronic  development of a dozen morpho-syntactic structures in Chinese 
              over the three-year course of this project. The ultimate goal of  the project
              is to prepare a historical grammar of Chinese  covering seventeen centuries of
              morpho-syntactic change. On the  one hand, the grammar will serve as a
              reference tool for  linguists as well as sinologists specializing in Chinese 
              literature, history and cultural studies, on the other hand it  will provide
              the first overall view of the diachronic drift of an  isolating language which
              has endured two thousand years without  changing its prototypical isolating
              status.
