Abstract    :
              9421744  Kolata       The Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics  (SIAM)
              will administer a travel grant program for U.S.  mathematicians to attend the
              third International Congress on  Industrial and Applied Mathematics (ICIAM 95).
               ICIAM 95 has  proved to be an effective way to foster the interaction of 
              U.S.> mathematicians and industry on a world wide basis.  It  is especially
              important for young researchers and graduate  students who are near completion
              of their thesis to  establish these connections.  These grants will help young 
              faculty and students make new connections in the world-wide  community of
              researchers and practitioners that they  normally would not be able to make. 
              They will also help  U.S. mathematicians keep pace with the advances in 
              applications of mathematics to technology and science.  Women and minorities
              will be especially encouraged to apply  for grants.
