Abstract    :
              Keyser       This project involves investigations of selected aspects of the
              dynamics of extratropical  baroclinic wave regimes, all of which will
              contribute to a better understanding of the process  of extratropical
              cyclogenesis.  The research will consist of both diagnostic and numerical 
              modeling studies.  Three principal activities to be undertaken are (1) analyses
              of ageostrophic  circulations in the vicinity of upper level jet streaks and
              frontal zones, (2) a study of the nature  of upper level precursors of
              cyclogenesis and the applicability of vortex dynamics, and (3) a  study of the
              dynamics and evolution of atmospheric jet streaks using a hierarchy of
              numerical  models.  The principal investigator's view of jet streak dynamics,
              in particular, is quite different  from the conventional view and, if shown to
              be correct, would radically change the atmospheric  sciences community's
              understanding of jets.  This research is important in improving  understanding
              of the development of midlatitude storms.  ***
