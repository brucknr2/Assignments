Abstract    :
              9421542    The investigator will conduct a comprehensive investigation of 
              children's relative clauses, consisting of six cross-sectional  studies over a
              three-year period. In the first five studies, they  will apply two
              well-established procedures in a consistent way to  investigate a wide variety
              of data domains that bear on the theory  of relative clauses. Each of these
              studies will investigate  children's knowledge of a different subset of
              properties involving  relative clauses. A sixth study will investigate
              children's on-line  processing of sentences containing relative clauses.       
              The studies are expected to produce both within subject and  within age group
              correlations across the phenomena under  investigation. In addition, children's
              judgments of sentences will  be compared with their productions. The findings
              will shed light on  the acquisition of relative clauses, as well as the
              properties of  relative clauses in the adult grammar. They will enable us to 
              characterize aspects of children's grammars and will help to  determine how and
              when children's grarnmars change to the adult  grammar. Such issues extend
              beyond the particulars of relative  clauses to the acquisition process in
              general.
