Abstract    :
              9421491  Brooks  This is an award to support research, the objective of which is
               to obtain an understanding of the fundamental physical and  chemical processes
              that control the interchange of substances in  alluvial sediments of flowing
              water streams with the water as  affected by the sediment bed forms such as
              ripples and dunes.   The basic approach being taken in this research is the
              conduct of   experiments in recirculating laboratory flumes under very 
              carefully controlled conditions of flow, water quality, the bed  media and the
              nature of the substances dissolved or in  particulate form being exchanged at
              the bed-fluid interface.      This is a renewal of research previously
              conducted under NSF  Grant No. 91-05965.  Results of this research may be
              applied to   answering important questions relating to the pollutional effects 
              that substances in bottom sediments of water bodies have on the  overlying
              water quality.  This knowledge is likely to be applied  in environmental
              engineering practice to determine approaches to  removal of potential water
              pollutants and contaminants from  sediments and in determining locations for
              wastewater treatment  plants that would minimize the undesirable effects on 
              environmental quality of their effluent discharges and management  practices
              for residual sludges.    ***
