Abstract    :
              9421180  Hall JC    Complex biological sounds are particularly important in 
              communication for many animals, as well as speech for  humans.  Such sounds
              contain information in both spectral  (sound wavelength, or pitch) and temporal
              (patterning)  domains.  These properties are encoded in responses of  neurons
              in the auditory nerve carrying signals from the ear  to the brain.  The coded
              signals are further transformed in  two important relay centers in the
              brainstem and in the  midbrain, as excitatory and inhibitory processes converge
              in  particular ways on particular neurons.  Some of the neurons  in these
              centers are highly selective in their responses to  particular spectral and
              temporal features of vocalizations  by animals of the same species. 
              Selectivity is created by  combinations of excitation and inhibition from
              neuronal  inputs to these cells.  This project uses frogs, with their  highly
              specialized calls, as a model system for exploring  the mechanisms of stimulus
              selectivity in auditory networks.  A combination of electrophysiology and
              pharmacology is used  in a novel approach to clarify how not just one, but two 
              different inhibitory compounds, called GABA and glycine,  shape these responses
              and sharpen the stimulus selectivity  of the system in the different stages. 
              Results will add to  our knowledge of how time and frequency filters are 
              constructed and interact in the auditory system, and enhance  our general
              understanding of the biological and  computational mechanisms that underlie
              complex sound  recognition.  The impact will extend beyond sensory 
              neurobiology to studies of communication behavior, to  engineering of
              artificial speech, and to recognition systems  for communications.
