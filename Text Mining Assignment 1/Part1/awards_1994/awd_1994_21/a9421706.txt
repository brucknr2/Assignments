Abstract    :
                The vestibular system includes part of the inner ear used for balance and
              locomotor control called the labyrinth, made of tubes and pouches containing
              fluids and the otolith organs.  These receptors send nerve inputs to various
              targets in the brain including the brainstem, the cerebellum, and centers for
              control of visual gaze; there also is an efferent pathway from the brain to
              modulate the receptor activity.  Recent advances have been made in the
              understanding the development of the labyrinth and vestibular brainstem, the
              contribution to information processing of ionic currents in the hair cell
              mechanoreceptors and the primary afferent nerves, the expression of molecular
              markers by vestibular neurons, and the cellular and systems processes
              responsible for motor learning.  Modeling has assumed new importance in
              directing experiments, and there is a new emphasis on the impact of the
              otoliths and of spatial orientation on gaze, posture, and locomotion.  This
              meeting reviews newer approaches to the study of the vestibular system,
              specifically to encourage dialog among workers bringing experience from a range
              of approaches and disciplines of vestibular work, and specific support is for
              younger students and researchers to attend.  This conference is likely to hate
              an impact beyond simply vestibular neurobiology, into areas of computational
              neuroscience and modeling, visual neuroscience, and behavioral neuroscience.
