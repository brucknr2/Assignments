Abstract    :
              9421116  Javanainen       Computational methods for semiclassical laser
              spectroscopy  and semiclassical and fully quantal theories of laser cooling and
               trapping will be developed and applied.  Optical manifestations  of particle
              statistics will also be investigated in order to  better understand
              Bose-Einstein condensation in a cooled, trapped  gas.  ***
