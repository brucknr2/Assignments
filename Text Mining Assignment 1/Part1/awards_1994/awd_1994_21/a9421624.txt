Abstract    :
                Professor Fitzgerald is continuing her work that seeks to locate the
              scientific and technological transformations in American agriculture within the
              broader framework of industrialization. Research so far indicates that
              agricultural innovations were a direct response to both the severe agricultural
              depression and the emergence of agricultural engi  neers and economists as new
              professional groups, both of whom brought to agriculture the views of urban
              engineers and economists. In the 1920s one can see a series of attempts to
              model agricultural practice on manufacturing practice, in both material and
              ideological terms.  Topics in this project include the emergence of
              agricultural experts in economics and engineering; the creation of an ethos of
              agricultural efficiency and abundance; the mechanization of agriculture; the
              trend toward large-scale, "factory" farming; a case study of such a farm; and
              the role of collectivization as a model for large-scale farms.  Thi  s project
              seeks to offer both a more interpretive account of agricultural change in
              America and a new set of cultural and intellectual benchmarks for the
              scientific and engineering practitioners of the past, whose material reshaping
              of our culture has been so pronounced.
