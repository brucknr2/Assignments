Abstract    :
              9421505  Alfonso    Communication between cells of the nervous system (called 
              neurons) is done via chemicals called neurotransmitters.  This chemical
              communication (synaptic transmission) involves  packaging of the
              neurotransmitter into vesicles that are  released when the neuron is activated.
               The goal of this  project is to understand the molecular and genetic bases of 
              release of these vesicles.  Synaptic transmission is being  studied in the soil
              nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, where  the investigator has identified new
              proteins involved in the  neurotransmitter vesicular release through the
              isolation of  mutations in the genes that encode these proteins.  Animals  with
              mutations in these gene have defects in synaptic  transmission mediated by the
              chemical neurotransmitters  acetylcholine and gamma-aminobutyric acid.  These
              studies  will give important insights into the regulation of  vesicular release
              from neurons and also vesicle-mediated  exocytosis in other cell types.
