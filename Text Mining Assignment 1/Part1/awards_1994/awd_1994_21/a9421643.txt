Abstract    :
                9421643  Futuyma   This project will use a group of closely related,
              specialized leaf beetles to study genetic constraints on the capacity to adapt
              to new host plants.  Research combining genetic analyses of the relationship
              among insect populations will be combined with selection experiments where leaf
              beetles are "forced" to adapt to new hosts.  These experiments will determine
              if genetic change occurs that reduces the adaptation of the experimental
              beetles to their normal host.  The experiments will test the leading hypothesis
              of host specialization - that trade-offs occur in adaptation to different
              resources.  This hypothesis is an important component of explanations
              concerning species divergence and the origins of biological diversity.  
              Agricultural insect pests frequently adapt to crops that are related to their
              wild plant hosts, and to pest-resistant cultivars that are developed at
              considerable expense.  This research will aid in understanding what kinds of
              plants an insect species can or can not adapt to.  Answers will aid in the
              development of pest-control strategies such as determining the kinds of genes
              that can be engineered from wild into cultivated plants or the use of
              economically unimportant "trap" crops to prevent potential pests from adapting
              to valuable crops.
