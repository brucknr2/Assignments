              Gautam Sen, professor of geology  at Florida International University, Miami, 
              Florida, to India.  He plans to meet with Dr.  K.V. Subbarao of the Indian
              Institute of  Technology at Bombay, and with B.P.  Radhakrishna, President of
              the Geological  Society of India, to plan for a workshop on  Deccan Trap
              Volcanism in India.  The proposed  workshop will have the following objectives:
               provide a review of current state of knowledge;  identify priorities in Deccan
              research; and to  form working groups that will be involved with  appropriate
              research.  ***
