Abstract    :
              9421602  Pye    This project funds an evaluator to study the industry/university
               interactions occurring in Alfred University's Industry/University  Cooperative
              Research Center for Glass Research.  The Center  continues to meet the renewal
              criteria requirements of the I/UCRC  Program.  This study generated the
              statistics for the Programs's  database.    The research is well qualified to
              perform this study.    The Program Manager recommends Alfred University be
              awarded $24,000  for 36 months.
