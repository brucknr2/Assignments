Abstract    :
              9421118         The project is to hold the Sixth Nilo-Saharan Linguistics 
              Conference at the University of California, Los Angeles, March  27-29, 1995.
              This will be the first time this conference has been  held in the United
              States. It will gather up to 100 faculty and  student scholars from all over
              the world, including most of the  prominent scholars working in this specialty
              field.        The planned timing and locale of the conference, just after  the
              26th Annual Conference on African Linguistics, will make it  possible for many
              of the participants, especially those from  overseas, to attend both meetings-
              a rare opportunity, given the  extensive travel usually involved. The NSF grant
              will allow the  participation of a carefully selected small group of African 
              scholars who would otherwise not be able to attend. It will also  cover modest
              costs of publishing the proceedings.
