Abstract    :
                Description:   This project supports a cooperative project by a US scientist,
              Dr. Kenneth Stevens, from the Research Laboratory of Electronics at the
              Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA and Dr. S.S. Agrawal of
              the Central Electronics Engineering Research Institute (CEERI) in New Delhi,
              India.  The two scientists plan to conduct synthesis of Hindi speech by
              computer, and to develop rules for synthesis and concatenation of basic Hindi
              phonemes to generate words and sentences.  The results of these studies would
              be subsequently used to develop a text-to-speech synthesizer for the Hindi
              language.  The KLSYN88, a cascade-parallel format synthesizer developed at MIT
              will be used as the basic tool to analyze and synthesize the sounds.  Since
              Hindi speech posses several types of special sounds that differ from the sounds
              in European languages, the most important of these are the stops and
              affricates, special attention will be paid to the analysis and synthesis of
              these sounds.  In addition to the two senior scientists, a post doctorate and a
              junior researcher from MIT will also participate in the research and will work
              with the Indian scientists in the New Delhi Laboratory.  Scope:  This project
              allows cooperation of two well known scientists whose capabilities complement
              each other to do important scientific work.  The major experimental work
              related to analysis and synthesis of Hindi speech will be carried at CEERI,
              while some experiments will also be conducted at MIT.  There will be frequent
              exchange of ideas, review of data, techniques and results through
              correspondence and through exchanges of visits by the P.I.'s and by the U.S.
              junior scientists. This project meets the objectives of the Division of
              International Programs in fostering international collaboration and increasing
              the exposure of young scientists to the international scientific scene.
