Abstract    :
              9421309  Baym       This project aims to develop the fundamental theory of 
              nuclear and other many-particle systems including  astrophysical and condensed
              matter applications.  It  includes basic studies of the quark-gluon plasma,
              hadron  structure, nuclear forces, the structure of nuclei, nuclear  and
              hadronic matter.  A wide range of electron-nucleus and  hadron-nucleus and
              hadron-nucleus scattering experiments and  heavy-ion collisions are analyzed in
              conjunction with these  basic studies.  The emphasis in astrophysics is on 
              understanding neutron star structure and evolution, low-  energy nuclear
              reactions, and the effect of phase  transitions in the early universe. 
              Fundamental problems in  the theory of quantum liquids, quantum liquid drops, 
              superconductivity and superfludity are also studied.  ***
