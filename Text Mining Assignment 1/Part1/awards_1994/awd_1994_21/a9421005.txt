Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              will help the  Department of Chemistry at Texas A&M University in the purchase
              of a modern 300 MHz  multinuclear NMR Spectrometer.  This equipment will be
              used in the following areas of  research:  (1)  The functionalization of
              saturated hydrocarbons; (2) polymer surface chemistry;  (3) asymmetric
              syntheses of biologically active molecules; (4) the pathways of S-H, C-S, H-H 
              and C-H activation by nickel, iron and cobalt; (5) the folding, structure and
              function of peptides  and proteins; (6) efficient construction of natural and
              unnatural products of biological  significance.    Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
              (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to  chemists for the
              elucidation of the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown 
              substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and
              to study the  dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution.  Access
              to state-of-the-art NMR  spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying
              out frontier research.  The results from  these NMR studies are useful in the
              areas such as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.
