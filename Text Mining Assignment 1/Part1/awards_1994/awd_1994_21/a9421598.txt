Abstract    :
              CTS-9421598  Ira M. Cohen          ABSTRACT         This work is a numerical
              analysis with experimental validation of low energy arc heat transfer between
              dissimilar electrodes. Application is to provide understanding and possible
              improvement in the wire-bonding chip-to-frame interconnection process in
              microelectronics. The experiment is a 60-times scaled-up model of the actual
              low-energy-arc wire-bonding process which will closely simulate the actual
              industrial process. Predictions from the numerical model will be checked
              against experimental results, and the model will be refined until it achieves
              good prediction accuracy.
