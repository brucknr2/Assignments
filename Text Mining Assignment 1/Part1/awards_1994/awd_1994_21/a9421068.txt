Abstract    :
              This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
              Program, focusses on  the detailed mechanisms of corrosion of iron and aluminum
              based materials.  A variety of  surface analytical probes are brought to bear
              on the atomic level characterization of corrosion  films, especially X-ray
              photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), analytical electron microscopy, and  X-ray
              diffraction.  These methods are used to identify reaction intermediates, and to
              suggest  mechanisms for corrosion of these materials.  The use of valence band
              XPS, in combination with  electronic structure calculations to identify
              specific surface species, provides a unique and very  powerful tool for the
              identification of intermediates and elucidation of mechanisms in these 
              studies.  A better understanding of corrosion mechanisms and processes is
              crucial to the  mitigation of corrosion, which is of serious environmental and
              economic concern.    The use of electron spectroscopic tools to identify and
              characterize corrosion products and  processes is the focus of this research
              project.  Corrosion of iron and aluminum based materials  is a serious
              technological problem, impacting the quality of the civil infrastructure and
              the  environment in many ways.  A clear understanding of the process of
              corrosion would be very  useful in designing strategies for corrosion
              inhibition and mitigation.
