Abstract    :
                  Detection of external chemical signals is important for  whole organisms, in
              the senses of taste and smell, as well  as being important for individual
              cells.  Calcium ions have  been implicated in responses of cells to external
              signals,  including chemical signals.  Bacteria have been developed as  a model
              system for conveniently studying the ways in which  chemical signals affect the
              cellular machinery of  responsiveness.  Bacteria in a liquid medium swim with a
               flagella; when it rotates clockwise they "run", but when it  rotates
              counterclockwise the show extensive tumbling and  reorientation.  While
              swimming, they show behavior called  chemotaxis; swimming toward sources of
              chemical attractant  compounds is a positive response, and tumbling away from 
              repellents is a negative response.  This project  investigates the role of
              calcium ions in these opposite  responses, and the mechanisms involved in the
              calcium ion  actions.  A simple assay of bacteria swimming into capillary 
              tubes provides behavioral data,  fluorescence calcium-  sensitive dyes measure
              calcium ion concentrations, and  labeled phosphate compounds that are taken up
              by proteins  allow measuring the effect of calcium ions on metabolic  reactions
              related to chemotaxis.  This work will have  important impact on chemosensory
              science and bacterial  biology, but also will have an impact on understanding 
              cellular mechanisms of behavior in other organisms because  calcium ions play
              key roles in the action of nerves and  muscles.
