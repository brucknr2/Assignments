Abstract    :
              9421445   Waymire    One of the classic problems in fluvial geomorphology and
              river basin hydrology is prediction of flows from ungauged river basins.  This
              is a very difficult problem because not only does it involve notions of
              dynamics via the conservation equations, but also that of geometry via
              branching of river networks, and of probability due to the presence mf
              fluctuations in river flows and river networks.  Since these notions recur
              across a broad range of spatial scales, the focus of our proposed research is
              on developing and empirically testing scaling invariance ideas and theories. 
              For the past several years, both the PIs have been extensively involved in
              exploring a scaling framework to study spatial rainfall, peak river flows
              viewed as channel forming discharges, and the 3-D structure of river networks. 
              Several unexpected and significant developments in this line of research within
              the last three years show that the scaling invariance ideas provide a very rich
              framework to tackle this problem.  In this proposal our objectives are: (1) to
              develop a geometric-statistical scaling theory of river networks, (2) to
              develop a statistical-dynamic scaling theory of river runoff, which are viewed
              as channel-forming discharges, (3) to develop a geometric-statistical-dynamic
              scaling theory to connect the 3-D geometry of river networks and flows and (4)
              to carry out tests of the theories in Objectives 1,2, and 3 via spatial data
              analysis and simulations.  This proposed research addresses how different
              notions of scaling, namely, geometric, dynamic, and statistical, can be woven
              together into a single, coherent theoretical framework to understand the
              physics of this problem and interpret space-time hydrologic data.  It has
              applications to a variety of hydrologic problems spanning a broad range of
              space and time scales.
