Abstract    :
              9421890  Nardi  During neural development and regeneration, the processes of 
              neurons often must navigate long distances to reach their targets.   During
              this growth phase, the neuron encounters many cues that  guide its navigation,
              including cell adhesion molecules, other  neurons, and glial cells.  This
              research seeks to define the role  that glial cells play in guiding growing
              neural processes to their  appropriate target.  To do this, a novel model
              system will be used.   In the insect wing, neural processes must navigate from
              the base of  the wing to the tip.  Along the way, the neural processes
              encounter  glial cells at precisely defined positions, positions at which 
              these processes often turn.  In this research, glial cells will be 
              transplanted to different positions to directly determine if the  presence or
              absence of glial cells influences the probability that  the neural processes
              will make the appropriate guidance choice.  If  this proves to be the case,
              further experiments will seek to define  the molecular basis of the guidance
              cues provided by glial cells.   This will provide fundamental information
              concerning the role that  glia play in nervous system development and
              regeneration.
