Abstract    :
              9421153  Tomsovic       This project is aimed at extending new, more powerful 
              semiclassical methods: i) to mesoscopic and atomic problems  - the emphasis is
              on quantum coherence and wave-function  localization problems, ii) to
              simplifying the difficulties  arising in connection with chaotic motion, iii)
              to  investigating the leading corrections and higher degrees of  freedom, and
              iv) to adapting the methods to stationary  quantum mechanics.  Finally,
              expertise garnered from  previous investigations will be brought into the
              classroom,  such as the animation of real time wave equation solutions.      
              The overall subject matter of this proposal is highly  interdisciplinary and
              has consequences in many domains.  Analogous phenomena can be found in
              acoustic, atomic,  mesoscopic, molecular and optical systems.  It has the 
              further interest of involving the Correspondence Principle  and ultimately the
              interpretation of quantum mechanics.  Experience reveals a strong student
              interest in the  combination of mesoscopic physics, nonlinear dynamics and 
              wave asymptotics.  Conversant students have a broad base and  are well equipped
              for research careers in a number of  disciplines.  ***
