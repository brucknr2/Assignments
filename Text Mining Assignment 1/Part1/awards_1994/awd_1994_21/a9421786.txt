Abstract    :
              9421786  El-Naggar    Description:  This project supports  participation of a
              U.S. delegation in a  conference "The First International conference  on
              Electronics, Circuits, and Systems-ICECS'94"  to be held in Cairo, Egypt,
              December 19-22,  1994.   The conference is planned to include  regular sessions
              on all aspects of the field of  electronics including analog, digital, solid- 
              state, power, high-speed, automotive,  biomedical, military and consumer
              electronics.   Special sessions, invited talks and tutorials  on specific
              advanced topics will also be  included.    Scope:  This project supports the
              participation  of six U.S. scientists in an important regional  conference,
              sponsored by the local chapter of  the IEEE.  The conference is a forum for 
              researchers and designers to present and  discuss various aspects of this
              emerging field  which is of great importance to both the U.S.  and to Egypt. 
              The interaction during the  meeting is likely to enhance collaborative 
              research and the involvement of Egyptian  graduate students in U.S. research.
