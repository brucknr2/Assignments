Abstract    :
              This is a  Small Grant for Exploratory research (SGER) proposal to complete the 
              construction of 5 Electric Field Floats (EEF) and deploy them as part of an
              oceanographic experiment. The EEF is a float, that when deployed together with
              a conventional RAFOS float, provides a measurement of the vertically averaged
              or barotropic velocities. The purpose of this SGER proposal is to complete the
              construction of 5 EEFs from parts on hand and deploy them from the Canadian R/V
              Hudson as part of a joint scientific program.  This experiment will allow them
              to test the performance of the instruments, coordinate modifications with other
              investigators, contribute observations to a pool of conventional measurements
              and provide unique observations of the partition of barotropic and baroclinic
              velocity components.
