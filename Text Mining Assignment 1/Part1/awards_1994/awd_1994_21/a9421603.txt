Abstract    :
              9421603  Ringo      The Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for 
              Analog/Digital Integrated Circuits was started as a multi-  university Center
              in 1989 with Washington State University and the  University of Washington. 
              Oregon State University became an  additional research site in 1991.  The State
              University of New  York, Stoneybrook is being added as another research site of
              the  Center.  Since only two companies are currently being added to the  Center
              in association with the new research site, the State  University of New York -
              Stoneybrook is being added tot he Center  as an affiliate.    The Center's
              research agenda is being expanded by the new research  site by studies to:  1)
              Develop new methods for the design of  analog integrated filters; 2) Develop
              design and simulation tasks  for emerging technologies; and 3) Investigate the
              analog behavior  of high performance digital circuits.    The Center's
              researchers are imminently qualified to perform the  Center's research
              projects.    The Center has been coordinated with Dr. Deborah Crawford, Solid 
              State and Microstructures Program.    Additional funding is provided for two
              supplemental awards to the  Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for
              Design  ofAnalog-Digital Integrated Circuits at Washington State  University. 
              The first is a Research Opportunity Award (ROA) to  provide an opportunity for
              two Assistant Professors at Cogswell  College North and Seattle University,
              both predominantly  undergraduate instituttions, to work on research in the
              area of  Simulation and Magnetic Modeling for Power Electronics.  No review  is
              required for a Research Opportunity Award, however, Dr. Vijay  Vittal, Program
              Director, Electrical and Communication Systems  provided an internal review. 
              His comments were very favorable and  strongly recommended support of the
              project.  The research work  performed through this award will professionally
              benefit everyone  involved in the project; the two women faculty members,
              CDADIC  researcher s, industrial sponsors, and the undergraduate students  who
              will participate in the project.  The second program provides  support for two
              undergraduates through the Research Experiences for  Undergraduate Research
              Program.  These students will work with two  Assistant Professors on the
              research project being supported  through the Research Opportunity Award and
              through this experience  will be provided a research experience which they
              otherwise would  not have access to at their institution.                The
              Program Manager recommends Washington State University be  awarded $143,186 for
              the first year of a five-year continuing  award.  An additonal $50,000 is
              recommended for 24 months for an  Researchy Opportunity Award and $10,000 for
              one year with funds  provided by the Research Experiences for Undergraduates
              Program.     Near the end of each 12-month period the Program Manager and/or
              the  Division Director of the Engineering Education Centers Division  will
              review the progress of the Center on a number of renewal  criteria including
              the following:  1) the extent to which the  industry/university interaction is
              developing; 2) the extent to  which the support base is developing; and 3) the
              extent to which  robust research program is developing.  If the review is 
              satisfactory, the Program Manager will recommend support for the  next period
              of this continuing award.
