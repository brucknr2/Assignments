Abstract    :
              9421385  Sucher       The goal of this research is to understand the 
              fundamental interactions of nature through their  manifestations in various
              aspects of particle physics,  astrophysics and atomic physics.  In particular,
              this  includes exploration of the nature of new physics such as  grand
              unification, supersymmetry, new gauge symmetries which  provide solutions to
              various unsolved problems of the  successful standard model of electroweak
              interactions, such  as the observed fermion mass hierarchies, the strong CP 
              problem etc., and have the potential to explain observations  pertaining to
              neutrino masses and mixings inferred from  solar neutrino data and hot dark
              matter of the universe.       Another area of investigation is the application
              of  Quantum Electrodynamics, the quantum theory of  electromagnetic
              interactions and Quantum Chromodynamics, the  theory of strong interactions to
              problems of atomic and  particle physics.  Specfic examples include the
              analysis of  forces between atoms, ions, and electrons which depend on  spin,
              the understanding of the highly excited states of the  helium atom, the
              interplay between strong and  electromagnetic forces in proton-proton
              scattering, and the  computation of forces between quarks and anti-quarks 
              resulting from the exchange of gluons.  ***
