Abstract    :
              9421455  Williams  This award will support field-based research to study the 
              eruptive activity and deposits of Llaima volcano in southern  Chile.  Eruption
              began on 17 May 1994.  The goals of the  study are to initiate research on the
              effect of lava flows  on glaciers at an erupting volcano and to improve 
              understanding of the controls on lahar production at  glaciated volcanoes.
