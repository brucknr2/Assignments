Abstract    :
              The post-doctoral fellow supported by this award  will work on the general
              problem of assessing the impact of data collected in the upper ocean to climate
              model predictions.  Hindcasts predictions from numerical ocean models (both
              research and operational models) will be compared with the upper ocean
              observational data sets collected in the Pacific under TOGA and WOCE. This
              effort will concentrate on the observed thermal structure of the upper tropical
              Pacific. This work will provide the needed guidance and justification for
              transferring the TOGA observing system in the Pacific from a research to an
              operational mode.
