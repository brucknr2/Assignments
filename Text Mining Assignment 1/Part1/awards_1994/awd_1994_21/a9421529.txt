Abstract    :
              IBN-9421529  Michael Ferkin      Seasonal reproduction is typical of most
              species of animals.  The  mechanisms that underlie seasonal changes are not
              well  characterized.  The proposed research examines a new and unique  effect
              of prolactin, a pituitary hormone, on reproductive behavior.   There is
              considerable evidence that prolactin inhibits  reproduction.  However, recent
              evidence suggests strongly that high  prolactin levels may be needed for the
              behaviors and physical  characteristics necessary for males attract females. 
              The apparent  paradoxical role of prolactin will be examined using an unique in
               vivo model.  Prolactin levels tend to be higher during the long  days of
              spring and summer which corresponds to the time of year  when animals are
              reproductively active, whereas, such levels tend  to be lower during the short
              days of fall and winter, and  correspond to the time of year when animals are
              reproductively  quiescent.  These studies will contribute results that can
              furnish  a new perspective on physiological mechanisms and behaviors 
              facilitating reproduction.  They will provide a context within  which we can
              understand the mechanisms underlying reproductive  behavior and
              hormone-behavior relationships and the evolutionary  processes leading to
              seasonal rhythms in reproduction.
