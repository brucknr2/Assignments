Abstract    :
              9421531  Salzberg     This award is to purchase equipment to be used for three
              distinct research projects.  The first project focuses on computational
              biology, especially on distinguishing exons and introns in raw DNA sequence
              data using statistical analysis and machine learning algorithms.  This project
              will also study algorithms for searching protein sequence databases to find
              fundamental building blocks called motifs.  The second project is a
              continuation and extension of previous work on analysis of very large databases
              of astronomical images from the Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based
              telescopes.  The development of automated classifiers to these databases is
              crucial for the success of astronomical sky surveys, in which data on hundreds
              of millions of celestial objects needs to be collected and classified in real
              time.  In the third project, the research group will develop distributed
              versions of their corpus-based language learning algorithms, which will allow
              them to run many more experiments and to make much more rapid progress in this
              research area.  The algorithms under development, which are computationally
              intensive, automatically acquire linguistic information from large text
              corpora, instead of having people manually input this information based upon
              their linguistic intuitions.
