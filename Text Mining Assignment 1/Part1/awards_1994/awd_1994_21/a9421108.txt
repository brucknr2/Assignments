Abstract    :
              This award supports a two-day symposium on the topic `Chemical and   Biological
              Controls on Mineral Growth and Dissolution Kinetics` and is   made jointly by
              the Division of Chemistry and the Division of Earth   Sciences.  The symposium
              will be held in April 1995 in Anaheim,   California, in conjunction with an
              annual meeting of the American   Chemical Society.  Participants from geology,
              chemistry, biology, and   physics will discuss the factors which control the
              rates at which   minerals dissolve and reform in the environment.  The presence
              of   microorganisms in geologic environments has only recently been understood 
               as an important factor.  One example of mineral dissolution is weathering   of
              rocks, and the process generally plays a major role in atmospheric   carbon
              dioxide release, transport of chemicals in waters, acidity of   lakes, and soil
              formation and fertility.  The conference is intended to   encourage
              collaboration among scientists in many disciplines and to focus   attention on
              an issue that is important both in obtaining accurate   climate models and in
              remediation of contaminated surface- and   groundwaters, soils, and sediments. 
              The symposium organizer is Dr. Lisa   L. Stillings, Department of Geology and
              Geophysics at the University of   Wyoming.   Proceedings of the symposium will
              be published.
