                                        ABSTRACT                                  Kibblewhite,
              Edward  AST-9421406    Astronomical observations with adaptive optics systems 
              require a detailed understanding of the optical systems and  the calibration
              systematic errors.  The Point Spread  Function (PSF) affects the signal-to
              noise ratio and the  ability to work in crowded fields.  To obtain reasonable 
              (5%) photometric accuracy, either the size of the aperture  must be chosen to
              encircle all the energy within the PSF,  negating the effect of the AO system,
              or a model of the PSF  must be used.  In addition, the success of deconvolution
              and  the other image enhancing techniques depends greatly on  knowledge of the
              PSF,    The program will compare observations of five star fields  using the
              adaptive optics system with a natural reference  source with different orders
              of correction and with a  Rayleigh backscattering laser beacon.  The five
              fields of  choice are multiple-star systems with separations varying  from less
              than one arcsecond to roughly one arcminute.  The  PSF will be obtained from
              the star images in each of the  observations.  In addition, observations in
              several bands  will illustrate the wavelength dependence of the PSF. 
              Photometric calibration will be made with observations o  photometric standard
              stars.  * * *
