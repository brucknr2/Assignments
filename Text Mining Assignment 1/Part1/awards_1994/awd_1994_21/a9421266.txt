Abstract    :
                                          Abstract  9421266  Baker  This project uses
              high-frequency coherent back-scatter radars to  study ionospheric structures of
              auroral origin and to determine the  magnetospheric activity responsible for
              the radar echoes.  The  existing radars are at Goose Bay, Labrador Canada and
              the British  Antarctic Survey station at Halley Bay, Antarctica.  This pair is 
              called the Polar Anglo-American Conjugate Experiment, and they are  so located
              that their fields of view are magnetically conjugate.   A new radar, called the
              Southern Hemisphere Auroral Experiment will  be installed at the new South
              African Sanae Station in Antarctica  when it is built.  Though not officially
              part of this consortium,  the new radar at the Japanese Antarctic Station,
              Syowa, will  contribute complementary data.    The project is a joint venture
              of Johns Hopkins University Applied  Physics Laboratory, British Antarctic
              Survey and the South African  National Antarctic Expedition.  The Japanese
              National Institute of  Polar Research is cooperating closely with the
              PACE/SHARE  collaboration.    JHU/APL developed the use of HF coherent radars
              for auroral  research, based on their extensive experience with
              Over-The-Horizon  radars, which are used for defense purposes.  ***
