Abstract    :
              9421950  Ehsani  Recent earthquakes have  demonstrated the life safety hazard 
              posed by unreinforced masonry (URM)  wall structures.  It is proposed to 
              strengthen the URM walls by fiber  composites. The flexibility, light  weight
              and high tensile strength of  composites makes them an ideal  material for
              strengthening masonry  structures.  A recent study has  demonstrated that
              significant  increases in strength and ductility  could be achieved for static 
              loading.  The primary objective of  this research project will be to  study the
              out-of-plane cyclic  behavior of unreinforced masonry  (URM) walls strengthened
              with fiber  composites and to develop analysis  and design procedures or
              seismic  strengthening of existing URM  structures.  Six wall specimens,  each
              approximately 8 ft wide and 10  ft tall, will be tested.  Two  different height
              to thickness  ratios (h/t = 14 and 28)  constructed of one or two wythes of 
              bricks will be examined.  Composite  fabrics epoxied to the wall will  either
              fully cover both faces of  the wall, or will be applied as  vertical strips
              spaced apart and  staggered on the opposite faces of  the wall.  Test results
              will be  used to develop design guidelines  for retrofitting of URM structures.
               The proposed research will be  closely coordinated with a parallel  research
              investigating the in-plane  cyclic behavior of fiber reinforced  URM wall at
              the University of  Michigan.  ***
