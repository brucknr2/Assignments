Abstract    :
              Research in theoretical gravitational physics will be  continued, and the
              following topics will be investigated:  A.  Decoherence and Quantum to
              Classical Transition  B.  Noise and Fluctuations in Gravitation and Cosmology 
              C.  Black Hole Thermodynamics and Backreaction  D.  Galaxy Formation and Phase
              Transitions in the Early      Universe  E.  Gravity as an Effective Theory  F. 
              Stochasticity and Complexity in Cosmology  The concepts and techniques of
              non-equilibrium statistical  mechanics and the formalisms of quantum stochastic
              field  theory in curved spacetime will be further developed and  applied to
              problems on the foundational aspects of quantum  and statistical mechanics,
              gravitation theory, general  relativity, cosmology and black hole physics.  The
              goals of  this work will be probing the deeper structures of the  physical laws
              under extreme conditions and understanding  their manifestations in the origin
              and dynamics of the  Universe.
