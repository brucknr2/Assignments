Abstract    :
              9421034  Adams    Several  problems  in  nuclear magnetism of  solid  helium-3 
              will  be investigated  at  temperatures as low as 20  microkelvin  and 
              magnetic fields  up to 20 Tesla. Ordering  in the high-pressure
              hexagonal-closed packed  phase,  which  is expected to be ferromagnetic because
               of  the dominance  of  triple exchange, will be achieved by using  the  helium
               nuclei  for  the  second  stage demagnetization.  The  high  field  to
              paramagnetic  phase transition, which occurs near  20 Tesla  where  the system
              becomes fully magnetized, will  be studied by measurement of the melting 
              pressure  to  obtain the magnetization.  The  nature  of  this transition  at
              low fields near the triple point ( where the low-field,  high-field,  and
              paramagnetic phases coexist) will be  investigated  by nuclear  magnetic
              resonance and thermal  transport measurements.  These three                    
                   investigations  will  provide  additional  insight  into   the 
              fundamental behavior of this model magnetic substance.  %%%      Solid 
              helium-3  is  considered a model magnetic system  for  studying fundamentals of
              magnetism. Because of the small  mass and  weak  forces between  atoms, the
              effect of  interest occur in a range of temperature near absolute zero,  below
              that of interest for electronic systems, but above  those  for  heavy nuclear
              magnets. Since the helium  is  highly compressible, effects can be investigated
              over a wide  range of density by  application  of  moderate pressure. In 
              particular,  the  type  of magnetic structures occurring in  two different type
              of crystals can be studied.  Methods of  investigation include nuclear magnetic
              resonance, melting  pressure, constant-volume pressure, and thermal 
              conductivity. Knowledge gained will be of use in  understanding magnetic
              phenomena in more complicated  magnetic systems.  ***
