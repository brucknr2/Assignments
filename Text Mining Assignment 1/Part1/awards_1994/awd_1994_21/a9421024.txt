Abstract    :
                 This project supports the research of a linguistic anthropologist from Johns
              Hopkins University in a field project studying language usage in Egypt.  The
              official language is Classical Arabic, a language whose source is the Koran 
              and which is used in prayer and in all official documents as well as in
              commercial uses.  Egyptian Arabic is the native language of elite and non-elite
              Egyptians, and is the vehicle of communication of daily life, poetry, folklore,
              songs and proverbs as well as film and TV.  Using participant observation and
              structured tests and interviews the investigator will study how average
              Egyptians relate to  the classical language, distinguishing categories by
              gender, social class and age.   The usage of classical Arabic as a symbol of
              pan-Arab Islam will be studied.    This research is important because Islam is
              a dynamic force in the world from the Balkans to the middle East and through
              the former USSR.   Increased understanding of the sources of solidarity and
              tension of language usage in an Islamic country will help us know how to deal
              with reactions of Islamic societies to encroaching modernism, persistent
              tradition, and to understand the differences between `Arab` and `Islamic`.
