Abstract    :
                                            ABSTRACT      AST-9421979  Aller, Hugh    The  
              goal  of  this  project  is  to  investigate  the  physical  conditions  in 
              the  radio emitting regions  of  active  galactic  nuclei and quasars in order
              to understand the generation and flow  of  high  energy plasma in objects
              exhibiting time-variable  flux  and  polarization.   The  primary  data  are 
              from  a  long  term  monitoring program conducted with a U. of Michigan
              26-meter radio  telescope.  The data are modeled to determine the properties 
              and  dynamics in the radio-emitting regions of active galactic nuclei.
