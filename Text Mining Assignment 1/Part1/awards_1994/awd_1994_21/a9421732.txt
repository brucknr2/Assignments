Abstract    :
              CTS-9421732  Ihab H. Farag  University of New Hampshire    ABSTRACT      The
              project is a regional pollution prevention conference involving students and
              faculty from many institutions of higher education in New England.  The
              conference is the first of its kind in New England, and is being sponsored by
              the Pollution Prevention Consortium of New England Universities.  It expects to
              attract and involve juniors, seniors and graduate students and faculty from a
              variety of disciplines.  Students already participating in pollution prevention
              research will be invited to present their results at the conference and share
              their experiences.  The conference will provide a forum for the exchange and
              demonstration of pollution prevention activities among students, and for the
              discussion and dissemination of pollution prevention education programs among
              faculty and educators.  Speakers from industry, academia, and state and federal
              agencies will participate.  Partial support has also been obtained from the US
              EPA and the US DOE.
