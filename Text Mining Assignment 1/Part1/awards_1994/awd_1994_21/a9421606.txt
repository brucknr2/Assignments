Abstract    :
                                        ABSTRACT                                  NINKOV,
              Zoran  AST-9421606    An ongoing investigation into the star formation process
              has  utilized the Rochester Institute of Technology 2K x 2K  cooled CCD camera
              to image OB clusters that are at the core  of associations in both the southern
              and northern  hemispheres.  These UBVRI images of the central 7' x 7' core 
              regions have allowed study of the initial mass function to  lower mass limits
              than previously determined.  In many of  these OB cores there is a central,
              luminous O-star, or  multiple system, that dominates the brightness.  From CCD 
              images it is apparent that these central O-stars have many  more companions
              than has been cataloged in existing double  and multiple star catalogs (e.g.
              ADS and IDS).  The  brightness of the central star and the size of the point 
              spread function results in considerable contamination of the  secondary star
              image.  Accurate multi-band photometry of the  companions would allow for
              estimation of their spectral  types and thus the mass function, and from this
              is a better  understanding of the massive star formation process and the 
              possible origin of runaway stars.  The use of the Phillips  Laboratory Starfire
              Optical Range to obtain high resolution  images of these central stars, and
              their companions, in a  number of OB clusters, and to permit the reduction and 
              analyses of this data.  * * *
