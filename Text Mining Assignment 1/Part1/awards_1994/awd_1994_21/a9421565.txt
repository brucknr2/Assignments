Abstract    :
              9421565  Scholz          This award supports a paleoenvironmental investigation
              of Lake   Victoria under the auspices of the International Decade for the  
              East African Lakes (IDEAL).  A seismic reflection and side-scan   sonar survey
              will be conducted to delineate modern sedimentary   environments, determine
              previous lowstand shorelines, locate and  measure thick sedimentary sequences,
              and identify promising core  sites for the recovery of 20 meter sediment cores.
               The primary   objective is to reconstruct a detailed environmental and
              climatic  history of Lake Victoria and its environs over the last 15,000  
              years, and compare that record within the regional and global   network of
              sites showing decadal and century-scale rapid climate  change.  This work will
              provide a chronologically robust, high   resolution, multi-proxy mapping of the
              Lake Victoria system's   response and sensitivity to climate variation.  This
              work will be  undertaken in close collaboration with the African scientific  
              community.   ***
