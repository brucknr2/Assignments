                                        ABSTRACT                                  HARVEY, Paul
                 The Starfire system is a state-of-the-art 1.5m adaptive  optics telescope
              with laser guide star correction.  This  means that for objects brighter than
              about 9 mag (visible)  it is possible to obtain essentially diffraction limited
               imaging over a field of view of order 10-20 arcseconds at  near-infrared
              wavelengths.  For fainter objects, it is still  possible to obtain such imaging
              over short time periods, of  order 0.05-0.1 sec by using the laser guide star
              with no  optical "tracking" correction.  This capability opens up a  variety of
              astronomical problems for observational  breakthroughs.    The first scientific
              goal in this program is to obtain  images of pre-main-sequence stars to study
              the distribution  of circumstellar matter on solar-system size spatail scales. 
              The second goal is to search for brown-dwarf companions to  known, young
              T-Tauri type stars.  This project makes use of  the fact the T-Tauri stars have
              a relatively well defined  age, and thus any companions that are found were
              probably  formed nearly simultaneously.  The final goal of the program  is to
              determine the relative abundance of old giants and  young supergiants in
              several "starburst" galactic nuclei.  this will make it possible to estimate
              the ages of the  starbursts and hence their frequency, much more reliably.
