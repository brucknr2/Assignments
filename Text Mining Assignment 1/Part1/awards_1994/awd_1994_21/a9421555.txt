Abstract    :
              A new mutation has been discovered in a strain of rats,  which produces a
              fundamental reorganization of the  forebrain.  This Small Grant for Exploratory
              Research will  establish a stable breeding colony of these mutants, and  begin
              to characterize the cellular organization of the  forebrain.  It is essential
              to breed the new strain of rat  immediately to preserve the mutation, and make
              it accessible  for experimentation in a variety of studies.  Histological 
              analysis of the brain of these animals will identify the  types of cells in the
              novel structure.  The established  colony will provide a valuable novel model
              system as a  resource for the community.  Research on this mutation has 
              potentially very high impact across neuroscience, because  such a large change
              in structure suggests novel tests for  structure-function relationships, as
              well as novel tests  about neural development.  Its potential impact extends 
              beyond neuroscience to developmental biology and to  biopsychology as well.
