Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT      AST-9421923  DePoy, Darren    This project supports the use of the
              Ohio State Infrared Imager/Spectrometer (OSIRIS) at the Starfire Optical Range
              (SOR) 1.5 telescope.  An internal field derotator will be constructed to allow
              for long integrations.  The optics will be reconfigured to deliver a 0.10"
              pixel -1scale.  to the 256x256 detector array.  Four scientific projects will
              be undertaken with the camera: JHK imaging of HII regions, broad-and
              narrow-band imaging of the Orion Nebula, the determination of the stellar
              luminosity function in M31, and JH imaging of known T Tauri binary stars.
