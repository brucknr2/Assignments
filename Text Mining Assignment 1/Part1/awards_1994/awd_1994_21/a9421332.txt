Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to provide a detailed test of the ACT-R theory.  The
              ACT-R theory is a production system theory of human cognition that concerns
              itself with how cognitive problem solving skills (for example, algebra equation
              solving) are organized and acquired.  It is a computer simulation program which
              is capable of modeling in detail the steps of problem solving.  The experiments
              in this project will test three new aspects that augment the ACT-R theory. 
              These are: (1) a detailed theory of how people scan visual information and how
              this relates to higher-level processing; (2) a theory of how attentional
              limitations affect success in retrieving information needed to solve problems
              from memory; and (3) a theory of how new problem-solving skills are learned by
              analogy.    The ACT-R theory has played a major role in translating
              psychological research into educational applications.  For instance,
              computer-based tutors, which incorporate ACT-R models, have been developed for
              teaching mathematics.  While such applications are already successful in
              improving educational achievement they could be even more successful if they
              were based on a more detailed interpretation of student behavior.  The new
              theoretical developments that the present experiments will test provide the
              requisite level of detail in the ACT-R theory; the present research will
              determine the accuracy of these theoretical extensions.
