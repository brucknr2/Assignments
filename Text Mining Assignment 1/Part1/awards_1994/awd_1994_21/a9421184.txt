Abstract    :
              Davies  9421184    The studies in this proposal focus on the relation between 
              the structures and loss properties of a series of perovskite  dielectrics. 
              While these tantalate-based oxides have the  lowest losses of all the microwave
              ceramics, optimization of  their properties requires careful control of their 
              chemistry, processing, and degree of structural order.  Preliminary
              investigations made on one of these systems have  indicated that the dielectric
              losses associated with  internal domain boundaries can be reduced by
              introducing  selected chemical substituents.  The proposal describes a  series
              of experimental studies designed to understand and  explain this effect, and
              outlines new approaches for  improving the loss properties of other petrovskite
               dielectrics.  Many aspects of this work are being conducted  in close
              collaboration with scientists from industry, and  several aspects of this study
              are expected to have a direct  impact on the processing and production
              commercial ceramic  resonator systems.  %%%  The goals of this work are to
              understand what aspects of the  structures of the existing microwave dielectric
              materials  are critical in realizing an optimized electronic  performance, and
              to use these crystal chemical insights to  enhance the performance of other
              oxide systems.  ***
