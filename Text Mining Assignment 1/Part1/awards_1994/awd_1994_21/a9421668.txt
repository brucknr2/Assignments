Abstract    :
              9421668  Shacham    This U.S.-Brazil Program award will fund a planning visit by
               Dr. Yosef Shacham of Cornell University to work with Prof.  J. W. Swart at the
              Universidade Estadual de Campinas,  Brazil.  They plan to discuss their
              research on  microelectronics technology, including applications of spin-  on
              glass films to ICs and electroless copper deposition. In  addition, Dr. Shacham
              will have the opportunity to use the  SIMS analysis tool to analyze metal
              structure. This tool is  available only at the University of Sao Paulo, and is
              of  great importance to the research being done at Cornell.  Dr.  Shacham will
              also make visits to Profs. M. Gameiro and Edval  Santos of the Universidade
              Federal de Pernambuco, and Prof.  H. Neves from the Federal University of Belo
              Horizonte to  discuss their common interests in semiconductor processing,  new
              materials, integrated sensors and electroless copper  deposition.        ***
