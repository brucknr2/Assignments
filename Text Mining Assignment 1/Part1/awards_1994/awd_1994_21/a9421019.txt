Abstract    :
              9421019  Brown    The purpose of this U.S.-Hungary joint research project
              between  Dr. Stuart E. Brown of the University of California, Los Angeles,  and
              Dr. Gyorgy Kriza of the Hungarian Research Institute for  Solid State Physics,
              Budapest, is to investigate the effect of  disorder on the spin-density-wave
              ground state and the transport  properties of a series of quasi-one-dimensional
              molecular salts.   Specifically, the researchers hope to interpret the
              crossover in  the spin-lattice relaxation which then think reflects a crossover
               in low-frequency transport damping.  They anticipate defining the  importance
              of disorder and thermal energies to such a crossover.   Results are expected to
              contribute to our fundamental knowledge  of phason dynamics, with potential
              relevance to materials  research in a number of fields.    This project in
              condensed matter physics fulfills the program  objective of advancing
              scientific knowledge by enabling leading  experts in the United States and
              Eastern Europe to combine  complementary talents and pool research resources in
              areas of  strong mutual interest and competence.  ***
