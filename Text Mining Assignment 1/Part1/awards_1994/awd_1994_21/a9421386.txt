Abstract    :
              9421386  Gates       The goal of this research is to explored aspects of 
              supersymmetry, supergravity and superstring theory where  there is a
              substantial overlap between the three areas.  The  primary purpose of this
              research is to increase our  understanding of supersymmetry as a principle that
              can be  realized in theories of Nature.  There presently appear to  be two
              candidate area where this seems likely to occur; (a.)  superstring-unified
              field models of the fundamental forces  and elementary particle and (b.)
              integrable and soluble  systems such as nonlinear wave propagation in
              hydrodynamics  and plasma systems.       To facilitate these investigations,
              techniques from  quantum field theory, tensor analysis and superspace 
              geometric analysis will be utilized.  ***
