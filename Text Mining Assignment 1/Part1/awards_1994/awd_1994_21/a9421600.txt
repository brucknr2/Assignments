Abstract    :
              9421600  Nail    This project funds a meeting to have industry/university 
              interaction to explore the potential to form an Industry/University 
              Cooperative Research Center for Pharmaceutical Processing at Purdue 
              University.  The meeting will try to identify the possible projects  of most
              significance to industry.  It will also determine if there  is sufficient
              interest and funding potential to establish this  Center.    Research areas
              being proposed for this potential Center include:   1) a continued focus on
              development of proteins, peptides, and  other biotechnology-based therapeutic
              and diagnostic agents;        2) development of more potent therapeutic agents
              which are  effective in ever smaller doses; 3) more sophisticated 
              pharmaceutical dosage forms such as novel vaccines, liposomal  formulations,
              and other complex disperse systems; 4) continued  emphasis by regulatory
              agencies worldwide on using the best  available technology to improve sterility
              assurance of injectable  products, and 4) productivity improvement by using
              higher speed  equipment, particularly for solid oral dosage form.    The
              researcher are well qualified to hold an industry/university  meeting to
              explore the potential for an I/UCRC.      The possible Center has been
              coordinated with Dr. Fred Heineken of  the Division of Bioengineering and
              Environmental Systems.    The Program Manager recommends Purdue University be
              awarded $10,000  for one year for this meeting.
