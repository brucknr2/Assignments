Abstract    :
              Evans/Abstract         The objective of this research is to increase the 
              understanding of how cloud structure affects radiative properties  and to
              improve methods of computing radiative transfer in  inhomogeneous clouds for
              parameterizations an remote sensing.  This  research will focus on using
              stochastic radiative transfer, in  which ensemble mean radiative properties are
              computed directly from  probability distributions that describe cloud
              inhomogeneity.   Stochastic modeling is appropriate because information about
              cloud  structure is inherently statistical.  Data from millimeterwave  radars
              and cloud probes on aircraft will be used to characterize  spatial structure in
              liquid water clouds, including within cloud  variability, in terms of the
              stochastic transfer probability  distributions.  Radiative transfer modeling
              will be done to learn  what aspects of cloud inhomogeneity are most important
              for the mean  radiative effects and how these may be best expressed with a few 
              simple parameters.  The modeled radiances and fluxes will be  compared with
              aircraft and ground based radiometers.  An  approximate method of using these
              inhomogeneous cloud parameters  for rapidly computing stochastic radiative
              transfer for use in  cloud radiation parameterizations will be sought. 
              Deterministic  radiative transfer modeling will also be done to investigate 
              relationships between the statistics of upwelling radiances and the  underlying
              inhomogeneity for use in  remote sensing of clouds.
