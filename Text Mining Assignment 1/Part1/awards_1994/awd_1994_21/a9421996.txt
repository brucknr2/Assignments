Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9421996    This is a study of the reactivity and dynamic behavior
              of adsorbates appearing during the catalytic reduction of nitric oxide, and of
              the interaction of silanes with alumina and with zeolites.  In -situ infrared
              spectroscopy coupled with transient kinetic approaches are used to study site
              structure and dynamic behavior of various adsorbates during the reaction of
              nitric oxide and carbon monoxide over rhodium-based catalysts, and during the
              reaction of nitric oxide, methane, and oxygen over ZSM-5 containing cobalt or
              copper.  The interactions of silanes with catalyst surfaces and reactions on
              silane-treated catalysts are investigated.  The feasibility of using silanation
              to improve the resistance of catalysts to sintering is assessed.    Some novel
              approaches to catalyst assessment and design are explored in this study. 
              Although this effort looks at systems used in control of nitrogen oxides from
              both mobile and stationary sources, the results will have very broad
              applicability.  ***
