Abstract    :
              9421780 Chang   This research advances the methodology of phase diagram
              calculations recently formulated by the principal investigators.  The
              calculations include ternary and quaternary systems and integrates these
              calculations with solidification models to predict the paths of solidification.
               The phase diagram of the quaternary system aluminum-magnesium-zinc-copper
              (Al-Mg-Zn-Cu) and the solidification paths of selected Al-rich alloys are to be
              calculated and verified by related experiments.  Phase diagram calculations for
              the quaternary system includes the constituent ternaries,  Al-Cu-Zn, Cu-Mg-Zn,
              and Al-Mg-Cu.  Solidification path calculations are carried out for selected
              Al-rich alloys using the Schiel model and modified Schiel model, which includes
              back diffusion in the solid.   The solidification experiments emphasize several
              alloys on the Al-rich side of the Al-Mg-Cu alloy system. %%% A knowledge of the
              thermodynamics and phase equilibria of multi-component alloy systems is vital
              in developing advanced materials and in improving the processing and
              manufacturing of advanced materials. ***
