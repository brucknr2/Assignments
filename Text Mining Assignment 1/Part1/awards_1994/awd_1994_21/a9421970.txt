Abstract    :
              The organization of the cortex of the brain is far from  being understood,
              despite extensive work on anatomy and  physiology, particularly on visual
              cortex.  We are still  revising basic principles, such as the usefulness of 
              multiple maps of sensory representations, the nature of  modular or topographic
              projections of neural pathways, and  the degree of strict hierarchy in
              ascending sensory systems.  This project uses sophisticated modern
              neuroanatomical  tracing methods to address problems of connections and micro- 
              circuitry within and between visual cortical areas of well-  studied functions.
               The novel emphasis is to get extensive  quantitative details on cellular
              connections at the rarely  studied integrative level between the large-scale of
               cortical mapping and the small-scale of single cells.  Data  are analyzed in
              terms of modularity, divergence, topographic  organization, and morphometry of
              the terminal branchings of  nerve axons.  Results will clarify the relative
              importance  of these various circuits for feedback and feed-forward  modulation
              of sensory processing.  These results will  contribute to a more comprehensive,
              quantitatively coherent  database of comparative cortical organization and 
              phylogenetic trends.   The potential impact extends beyond  visual neuroscience
              into evaluations of cortical  architecture, and cognitive and computational
              models of  network processing.
