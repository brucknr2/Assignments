Abstract    :
              9421031           Haselkorn           This multi-user equipment award provides
              funds for an automated DNA sequencer and           associated components. The
              principal users are members of the Department of Molecular           Genetics
              and Cell Biology. The research themes of the users are united by interests in  
                      gene organization and regulation, with the organisms being studied
              including bacteria,           yeast, and plants. The bacterial work
              concentrates on the photosynthetic Anabaena           bacteria. More than 1,000
              genes are being studied whose expression is differentially           induced by
              the production of heterocysts. Yeast work is concentrating on regions of the   
                     chromosomes that are relatively silent in gene expression and the
              identification of other           genes that can induce expression in the
              silent regions. The plant work is primarily on           Arabidopsis, where
              genes required for interaction between pollen grains and the pistil          
              during fertilization are being identified. Genes from other organisms that have
              similar           DNA base sequences are being isolated and sequenced. A gene
              family that codes for the           chloroplast processing enzyme is being
              identified. This family is responsible for enabling           proteins to enter
              the chloroplasts, where photosynthesis occurs. Finally, genes from          
              wheat that are involved in herbicide resistance are being sequenced in order to
              see how           they differ from the genes in sensitive plants.           %%%
                        The sequencing being carried out with this machine is important for
              our understanding of           bacterial development, gene expression in yeast,
              and mechanisms of herbicide resistance           in crop plants.           ***
