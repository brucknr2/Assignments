Abstract    :
              9421898  Pradhan     This project is a continuation of previous research on the 
              calculation of opacities for the Iron group elements.  The data  is needed to
              model stellar evolution as well as for fusion  applications.  A significant
              part of the new research is directed  toward the paralleling existing
              collisions codes to enable the  computer intensive parts of the program to move
              forward.  These  developments will also be useful for other computational
              atomic  and molecular theorists desiring to move toward parallel  computing
              platforms.  ***
