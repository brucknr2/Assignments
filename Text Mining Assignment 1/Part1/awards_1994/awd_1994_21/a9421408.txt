Abstract    :
              9421408  Grotch       Theoretical research continues on the structure of 
              positronium, the Lamb shift and quarkonium.  The results will  have impact on
              ongoing experiments in QED, for precision  spectroscopy and for the decay and
              spectra of heavy quark-  antiquark systems.  ***
