Abstract    :
              9421881  VEBLEN       The influence of climate variation on vegetation are most 
              evident at coarse spatial and temporal scales.  The effects of  climate change
              on vegetational dynamics have been less clear at  time scales of decades to a
              few centuries, however.  Foremost  among the issues that have hindered research
              at this scale are  problems in separating climate-related from human-induced
              changes  and methodological problems in spatial and temporal scaling.  One 
              line of research that has offered great promise are analyses of  the role of
              fire as a factor influencing vegetation change at  scales ranging from local to
              regional.  This project will  continue collaborations by U.S. and Argentine
              scientists, who  have been studying the impacts of climate and human activities
              on  fire regimes in northern Patagonia over the last 700 to 1,000  years.  Past
              research by these investigators have focused on a  single transect ranging from
              Andean rainforests to Patagonian  steppes.  This research documented the
              influences of humans on  fire regimes over the last 250 years, and it analyzed
              the  influences of seasonal and annual climate variations on fire  regimes. 
              The research to be supported through this award will  expand on this base. 
              Research methods that will be used include  the dendrochronological dating of
              past fires, climatic  reconstructions through analyses of tree rings, analyses
              of fire-  regime variations over at least 700 years in relation to climatic 
              variation, and evaluation of archeological and historical data  focusing on
              human influences on fire regimes.  These analyses  will be conducted in three
              different study areas (at 38-, 41-,  and 43-degrees South latitude), which have
              different histories of  human occupation but common regional climatic
              variations.  As a  result, human impacts should be distinguishable from
              broader-  scale climatic influences on fire regimes.       This research will
              complement previous research on the  dynamics of fire regimes by incorporating
              the effects of  climate  variation across a broad range of temporal scales and
              by  broadening the geographic perspective to a regional scale.  This 
              integration will be a significant contribution to the challenge  of relating
              research on local-scale processes to climatic and  human influences on
              vegetation at landscape and regional scales.
