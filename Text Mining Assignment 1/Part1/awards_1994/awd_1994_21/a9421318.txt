Abstract    :
              9421318  O'Neil     The research focuses on the physics of single-species
              plasmas-  pure electron and pure ion plasmas.  It includes both experiment  and
              theory and places a great deal of emphasis on characterizing  the fundamental
              properties of these systems.  The plasmas are  magnetically trapped in simple
              geometrical configurations where  by a combination of theory and experiment it
              is possible to  extract information crucial to a physical understanding of the 
              plasma state of matter.  ***
