Abstract    :
              9421862  Clark  This project is on research to study the production of enzymes 
              from extremophiles by expression of these enzymes in mesophiles,  using
              recombinant DNA technology.  The objective is to make  available large
              quantities of these enzymes for biophysical and  biochemical characterization
              and ultimately for enzymatic  applications, without the need for culturing
              extremophiles  directly.  The specific objectives of this research include: (1)
               to clone and identify gene sequences from the hyperthermophile  Pyrococcus
              furiosus and related thermophiles; (2) to express  genes in heterologous
              systems at high pressure, and characterize  recombinant enzymes under elevated
              pressure and temperature to  establish optimal specific activity and assembly;
              and (3) to  develop bioprocessing methods for obtaining enzymes in sufficient 
              quantity for structural determination and biotechnological  applications.  ***
