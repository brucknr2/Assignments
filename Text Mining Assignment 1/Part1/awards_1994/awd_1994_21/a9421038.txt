Abstract    :
              CTS-9421088  M. Douglas LeVan  University of Virginia    ABSTRACT        This
              conference will allow the domestic participants to interact with their
              competitive international counterparts and exchange ideas on the fundamentals
              and applications of adsorption.  The relevance of this meeting to the
              Separation and Purifications program is borne by the fact that NSF has
              supported the previous four conferences on "Fundamentals of Adsorption".
