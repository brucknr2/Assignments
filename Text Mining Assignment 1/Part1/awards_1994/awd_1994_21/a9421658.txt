Abstract    :
              DeVries, Geert  IBN 94-21658    The brain employs a host of chemical substances
              to facilitate communication between cells resident therein.  One class of
              effector molecules are small proteins called neuropeptides and although, the
              presence of these molecules has been known for sometime, their true function as
              messenger molecules remains ambiguous.  There is virtually no neuropeptide
              system for which the inputs and outputs are mapped; for which the stimuli that
              regulate activity are identified; and of which the physiological and behavioral
              consequences of changes in its activity are known.  Dr. DeVries will utilize a
              unique, well characterized and sexually dimorphic biological system to unravel
              the role of vasopressin, a neuropeptide, as messenger molecules in the brain. 
              Vasopressin-containing neurons have been implicated in a variety of functions,
              such as thermo- and osmoregulation, sexual behavior, aggression and memory. 
              Dr. DeVries will characterize the in- and outputs of subsets of
              vasopressin-containing cells and the response of these subsets of neurons to
              various stimuli associated with vasopressin-mediated behaviors.  In addition,
              because the vasopressin-containing neurons are sexually dimorphic, the gonadal
              steroid milieu dictates the activity of the neurons.  This feature of these
              neurons will be employed to examine the role of these neurons in several
              physiological functions and behaviors in a coordinated manner.  These studies
              will characterize the anatomical and physiological importance of a
              well-characterized neuropeptide system of the brain.  Potentially, this basic
              information about neuropeptides will enhance our understanding of animal
              behavior and may facilitate animal husbandry.  Additionally, these studies have
              immense implications in the diagnosis and treatment of human psychopathological
              disorders where multiple physiological and behaviors are disrupted.
