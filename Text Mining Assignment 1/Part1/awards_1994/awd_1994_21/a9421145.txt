Abstract    :
              Abstract for Proposal AST 94-21145   P.I.: Robert C. Kennicutt   University of
              Arizona         The objective of this project is to obtain data on the
              large-scale star formation   properties and evolutionary properties of nearby
              galaxies. Such data provide   essential ingredients for understanding and
              modeling the evolution of galaxies, and   for understanding the physical
              processes that drive this evolution. They also   provide the opportunity to
              develop and test the diagnostic methods needed to   interpret observations of
              more distant galaxies at cosmological lookback times.   Specific projects to be
              carried out include the following: 1) The determination of the   star formation
              histories of galactic disks as a function of Hubble type and radius   within
              individual galaxies, based on Ha and broadband surface photometry of 30  
              spiral galaxies. 2) A study of the systematic properties of OB/HII associations
              in   spiral galaxies, based on a combination of groundbased imaging and
              spectroscopy   and imaging with the Hubble Space Telescope. 3) An observational
              study of the   stellar populations and star formation properties of galactic
              mergers. 4) An   investigation of the form of the star formation rate vs. gas
              density law in disks,   based on CCD observations of a complete sample of
              nearly spirals. Gravitational   threshold and self-regulating star formation
              models will be tested. 5) Studies of the   dynamics of the ionized interstellar
              gas in Magellanic irregular galaxies. These are   directed at measuring the
              dynamic interactions between massive stars and the   interstellar medium, and
              the role of large-scale winds and flows in the evolution of   dwarf galaxies.
