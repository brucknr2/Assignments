Abstract    :
              Hans Andersen of Stanford University is supported by a grant from the  
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to study computer   simulations
              of chemical and materials systems.   Andersen's research will   focus on new
              computer simulation approaches to chemical and materials   systems.  Four major
              areas of research will be pursued:1) Quantum theory   of reaction rates of both
              condensed and gas phase chemical species; 2)   Computer simulation studies of
              melting in two dimensional arrays of   colloidal particles; 3) Theory of
              interaction of charged colloidal   particles in aqueous ionic solution; and 4)
              Methods for ab initio   computer simulation of materials including the use of
              new   pseudopotentials, an improved density functional method, and the use of  
              wavelets for basis functions.  Computer simulations of chemical systems have
              provided chemists with many   new physical insights related to the elucidation
              of  chemical properties   in atomic and molecular terms.   As the models
              continue to improve, the   predictions of such models become increasingly
              reliable.  As   computational capabilities continue to improve, the size of
              systems which   can be reliably treated continues to increase.  Andersen's
              research is   directed at the simulation of systems which are of chemical and
              material   importance many of which exhibit quantum effects and cannot be
              treated by   ordinary classical simulation techniques.  Andersen will develop
              new   computational approaches which will facilitate the treatment of such  
              systems.
