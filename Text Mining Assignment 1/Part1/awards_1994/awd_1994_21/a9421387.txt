Abstract    :
              9421387  Greenberg       The Haag expansion (N quantum approximation) will be 
              used to study quantum chromodynamics (QCD), with emphasis on  the relation of
              the constituent quark model to the parton  model; i.e., the relation of 
              constituent and current  quarks.  The goal is to bring quantum field theory
              methods  starting from the QCD Lagrangian to bear on empirical data  ranging
              from hadron spectroscopy to deep inelastic  scattering processes.  Specfic
              issues to be investigated  include chiral symmetry breaking, confinement, and
              the  description of relativistic bound states.       Theoretical investigations
              will also include studies of  (i) radiative and electroweak0induced fine
              structure effects  on the fermion masses in the composite model, (ii) dynamical
               breaking  of supersymmetry, chiral and vectorial symmetries,  (iii) Yukawa
              unification (which is forced in the preon  model) and understanding large tan B
              (iv) expected masses of  the SUSY-spectrum in the preon model, (v) the question
              of  the unity of all forces at the preon level, (vi)  cosmological issues
              related to inflation, baryogenesis and  dark matter and (vii) a possible origin
              of the preonic  spectrum and gauge group from superstring theories.  ***
