Abstract    :
              9421592  Zeitler   This award provides partial (67%) funding for the acquisition
              of a laser microprobe system that will be shared as a sampling source between
              the argon-argon dating and stable isotope laboratories in the Department of
              Earth and Environmental Sciences at Lehigh University. The remaining aosts
              associated with funding this equipment acquisition will be provided by Lehigh
              University. Gas extraction by laser will add a number of substantial
              capabilities to these earth science analytical facilities. Chief among them is
              the ability to sample individual mineral grains or portions of grains with a
              spatial resolution of several tens of micrometers, especially important in
              applications such as the geochronology and geothermometry research at Lehigh
              University.  ***
