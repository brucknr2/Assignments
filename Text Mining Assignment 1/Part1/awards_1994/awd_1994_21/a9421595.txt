Abstract    :
              9421595  Davoodi  This project provides support for U. S. researchers to 
              participate in Third International Conference on Stochastic  Structural
              Dynamics to be hosted by the University of Puerto  Rico from January 15-18,
              1995.  This conference aims to be a  forum for bringing together researchers
              from various  engineering disciplines, physics, and mathematical sciences  from
              throughout the world, who work in the area of  stochastic mechanics.  The
              conference is organized by the  University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez,
              Worcester Polytechnic  Institute, and Rice University. This conference will
              provide  an opportunity to explore possibilities for research  collaborations
              between institutions of higher education in  the United States.  Because of the
              geographical location of  Puerto Rico, this conference provides an excellent 
              opportunity for the researchers of South and Central  Americas to present their
              work and establish stronger ties  with the stochastic community in the United
              States.  In  addition, this conference will promote an exchange of ideas  on
              the status of stochastic mechanics methods as they are  applied to analysis of
              a broad spectrum of multidisciplinary  problems in mathematical sciences,
              physics, and engineering.  ***
