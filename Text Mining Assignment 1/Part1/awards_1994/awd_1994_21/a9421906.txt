Abstract    :
              9421906  Melosh         The project will provide support for several US
              numerical  modelers to attend the workshop on tectonic modeling of convective 
              and tectonic processes in Oleron, France, June 20-26, 1993.  This  workshop is
              a unique gathering where codes and numerical methods of  solving tectonic
              problems are emphasized, rather than the results  of such application.  In
              particular, the workshop provides a forum  for the benchmarking of numerical
              codes.  The interactions and  sharing afforded by such a workshop are
              invaluable in the advance-  ment of the science.  ***
