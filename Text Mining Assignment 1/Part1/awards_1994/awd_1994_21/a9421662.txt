Abstract    :
              9421662  Wieman    This award provides funds to permit Dr. Carl E. Wieman, 
              Department of Physics and Joint Institute for Laboratory  Astrophysics,
              University of Colorado, to pursue with Dr. Donghyun  Cho, Department of
              Physics, Korea University, for 24 months, a  program of cooperative research
              involving high-precision  spectroscopic measurements on spin-polarized cesium
              atoms which  are subjected to various electromagnetic fields.  The 
              collaborators will use apparatus which they developed to study  phenomena
              produced when these cesium atoms are subjected to very  intense, tunable,
              narrowband, laser light at 540 nm.    In addition to producing high-precision
              data about the cesium  atom itself, the proposed research will use new ideas
              and  techniques that will have general application in the field of  measurement
              science.  The collaborators have a common interest in  high precision
              spectroscopy of atomic systems.  Dr. Cho has  participated in construction of
              the apparatus to be used at the  University of Colorado and will develop, in
              Korea, additional  equipment which will lead to improved sensitivity in the
              proposed  experiments.  This project is relevant to the objectives of the 
              U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program which seeks to increase  the level of
              cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists and  engineers through the
              exchange of scientific information, ideas,  skills, and techniques and through
              collaboration on problems of  mutual benefit.  Korean participation in the
              project is supported  by the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).
