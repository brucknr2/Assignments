Abstract    :
              This award will provide funding for the renovation of space for the 
              Biochemistry Department at the Medical University of South Carolina.   Vacated
              space, located in the Basic Sciences Building, will be renovated into  modern
              research laboratories and biochemical support units.  Renovations  will include
              asbestos abatement, improving the HVAC system and installing  new casework and
              fume hoods to construct modern research laboratories,  with accompanying 
              shared biochemical support areas, and a transgenic  animal facility.  The
              project is the first step in the re-building of the  Department of Biochemistry
              and Molecular Biology into a strong central core  resource that will
              significantly enhance many diverse disciplines including  genetics, physiology,
              kinetics, immunology, pharmacology, organic chemistry,  and biophysics.  The
              renovation will be a vehicle in recruiting a structure- function biochemist and
              other faculty with expertise in  areas such as protein  biochemistry,
              enzymology, crystallography, and micro-sequencing synthesis.   Because of the
              fundamental nature of biochemistry as a discipline, the  improved research
              infrastructure will impact researchers at all levels of  education.  The
              university's proactive participation in research training  programs for
              postdocs, graduate students, undergraduates, and high school  teachers and
              students will be augmented through the re-building of its  biochemistry
              program.
