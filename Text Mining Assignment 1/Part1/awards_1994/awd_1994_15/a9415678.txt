Abstract    :
              This laboratory project will measure the differential cross  sections of ozone
              (O3) for the energy loss of 0.2 eV to 1.5 eV  region by electron impact in
              order to identify any states which  exist in this energy region.  The
              differential cross sections for  the energy loss in this important low energy
              region will be  measured by utilizing a supersonic beam to reduce the
              rotational  and vibrational temperatures and minimize spectral congestion.  A 
              crossed-beam method will be used to obtain data for laboratory  angles from 6
              to 160 .  The energy loss spectra and the residual  mode spectra will be
              decomposed by a simulated annealing computer  technique in order to obtain the
              vertical energies and slopes of  potential surfaces in the O3 Franck-Condon
              region for each excited  electronic state which contributes to the bands.
