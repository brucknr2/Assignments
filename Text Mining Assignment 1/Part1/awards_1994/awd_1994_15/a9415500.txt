Abstract    :
              9415500  Riedel       Funds are provided for the continued operation of the
              deep-  sea core and dredge samples' repository at Scripps Institution of 
              Oceanography for three years.  These samples are vital to our  understanding of
              the past and present oceans, climates and events  on the continent.  Newly
              acquired cores will be integrated into  the curatorial system and the old cores
              and dredges will be  continued to be curated and distributed to scientists
              requesting  samples.  Data of cores will be bank with the National  Geophysical
              Data Center where computer searches will facilitate  sample selection by
              investigators.  ***
