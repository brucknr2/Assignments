Abstract    :
              9415513  Renne  This collaborative project is to conduct petrologic, Nd, Sr, 
              Pb-isotopic, major and trace element geochemical studies,  3He/4He isotopic and
              40Ar/39Ar geochronologic studies of  alkalic igneous rocks, which are found in
              association with  the major flood basalt provinces of Deccan in India and 
              Parana in Brazil.  This research will establish the time-  relationship of the
              alkalic rocks with respect to the main  pulse of voluminous flood basalt
              volcanism.  This research  will also attempt to establish early temporal
              histories of  the Reunion and Tristen da Cunha mantle plumes, which are 
              generally believed to be responsible for Deccan and Parana  volcanism,
              respectively.  The proposed acquisition of the  isotopic data of He, Nd, Sr and
              Pb are expected to  characterize the plume source-magma.  The results of this 
              study are also expected to contribute to current  controversies regarding
              plume-impact versus plume-incubation  hypotheses and on questions of the
              relative contributions of  lithospheric mantle in flood basalt generation.
