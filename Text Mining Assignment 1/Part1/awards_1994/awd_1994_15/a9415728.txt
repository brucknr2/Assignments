Abstract    :
              9415728  Lindell  This  project is being funded as part of the National 
              Earthquake  Hazards  Reduction Program's investigation into  the  causes  and 
              effects of the January 17, 1994 Northridge earthquake.  The study  will survey
              companies operating hazardous material facilities  to  assess  the  extent  to
              which the earthquake initiated  releases,  caused  precursor events (such as
              damage to storage tanks, pipes,  and  valves),  and produced a loss of
              emergency response  systems  (especially  power  and communications).   The 
              study  will  also  assess  the  degree to which the facilities had developed 
              hazard  mitigation   and  emergency  preparedness  measures  before   the 
              Northridge  earthquake, have upgraded these  measures  since  the  earthquake 
              occurred, or intended to upgrade  them  in  the  near  future.  The research
              will provide a greater understanding of the  magnitude  of  hazardous materials
              threats posed by  earthquakes,  and  the  factors  that  influence  the 
              adoption  of  mitigation  measures and emergency preparedness actions.  ***
