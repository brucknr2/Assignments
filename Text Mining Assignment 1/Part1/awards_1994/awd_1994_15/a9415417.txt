Abstract    :
              9415417  Somasundaran    Description:  This project supports  collaboration
              between Dr. P. Somasundaran of  the School of Mining at Columbia University and
               Dr. Pradip of the Tata Research, Development &  Design Centre in Pune, India. 
              An integrated  approach is proposed to develop an accurate  understanding of
              the mechanisms involved to  alleviate the problems associated with  separation
              of fines and ultrafines from raw  materials.  It is planned to investigate 
              selective flocculation/dispersion of hematite-  alumina system of fines and
              ultrafines in the  presence of polymeric reagents.  Emphasis will  be on the
              identification of mechanisms by which  interactions between reagents at the
              interface  control selectivity.  A multi-pronged approach  using diffuse
              reflectance infra-red Fourier  transform (DRIFT) spectroscopy, fluorescence 
              spectroscopy, electron spin resonance  spectroscopy along with conventional
              techniques  of electrokinetics, adsorption, flocculation  and wetting will be
              employed.     Scope:  The project brings together two well  regarded
              laboratories in India and the U.S. to  conduct research in an important area of
               mineral processing.  The scientists have  complementary capabilities and
              resources and  also have excellent track record of research.   Students from
              the two countries will be  involved in the research.  The project meets  INT
              objectives for enhancing U.S.-foreign  collaboration in areas of interest to
              both  sides.  ***
