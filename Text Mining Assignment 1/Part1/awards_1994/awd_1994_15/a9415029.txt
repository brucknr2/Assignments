Abstract    :
              New College, the Honors College of the University of South Florida, is the
              recipient of ARI  funds to replace 9,778 square feet (911 square meters) of
              deteriorating marine biological research  space.  This project is part of a
              general enhancement of the natural science facilities.  Since the  inception of
              New College in 1960, independent research studies on marine organisms have been
               an important part of the scholastic activities pursued by biology faculty and
              students.  The  marine facility reflects the central role that marine biology
              plays in the mission of a college that  borders Sarasota Bay.  Currently,
              research areas, seawater systems, and field equipment are  scattered across
              five building some distance away from the bay.  Completion of the facility will
               increase productivity of research activities by permitting:  increased number
              of projects;  possibilities for studying a wider range of marine organisms and
              ecosystems; and better control  of environmental variables for maintaining and
              investigating a variety of organisms.  The new  facility will also have a
              significant impact on the number of New College graduates entering the 
              professional biological science pipeline, not only in traditional marine
              biology, but also in the  areas of behavior and community ecology, population
              genetics, reproductive and conservation  biology and neuroscience.
