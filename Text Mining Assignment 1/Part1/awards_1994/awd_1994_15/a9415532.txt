Abstract    :
              9415532  Gainer    Description:   This project supports a  cooperative project
              by two U.S. scientist, Drs.  John Gainer and Giorgio Carta, both in the 
              Chemical Engineering Department at the  University of Virginia,
              Charlottesville, and  Dr. Ahmed Zaidi, Ecole Mohammadia d'Ingenieurs, 
              Universite Mohammed V, in Rabat, Morocco.   Preliminary research results
              indicate that  esters made from alcohols and fatty acids can  be synthesized
              using enzymes in organic medium.  The planned work aims at confirming these 
              results, and extending the method to the  synthesis of other esters.  These
              esters have  significant applications in the food, cosmetic  and pharmaceutical
              industries because of their  good biodegradability and low toxicity 
              properties.  In the planned work, the first  phase will focus on the reactions
              of oleic acid  with short-chain alcohols, using lipase  enzymes. The second
              phase will emphasize the  reactions of oleic acid with long-chain  alcohols to
              produce high molecular weight  esters which have uses as plasticizers and 
              lubricants.     Scope:  This project meets a number of  important objectives of
              the Division of  International Programs.  It allows cooperation  of three
              active scientists whose capabilities  complement each others to do important 
              scientific work; it allows for a  foreign scientist in a developing country to 
              gain the experience necessary to continue this  useful research beyond this
              project, and it  provides the scientific basis for what may be  new useful
              products in important industries in  the U.S. and in less industrialized
              countries.  ***
