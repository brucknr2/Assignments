Abstract    :
              9415715  Heberlein    This three-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative
               research in plasma-aided manufacturing between research  groups at the
              University of Minnesota and the University of  Limoges.  The U.S. investigators
              are Joachim Heberlein and  Emil Pfender and the French investigator is Pierre
              Fauchais.  The objective of their research is to perform diagnostic 
              experiments designed to improve the reliability and  controllability of the
              plasma spray process. The proposed  research addresses the major cause of the
              lack of  reproducibility, namely the uncontrolled dynamic behavior of  the arc
              in the plasma torch. An improved plasma torch could  have important
              applications in large-scale manufacturing and  a variety of industrial
              processes, among them cutting,  welding, plasma spraying, extractive
              metallurgy, melting-  refining, and chemical synthesis.    The U.S. and French
              laboratories have developed specific  diagnostic techniques for studying the
              plasma process. The  proposal takes advantage complementary expertise and
              ongoing  experimental efforts.  Different diagnostic techniques will  be used
              on plasma torches of different geometries.  Subsequent experiments on torches
              of similar design will  then be conducted.  The project will advance
              understanding  of the dynamic behavior of the plasma arc and will result in 
              improved design guidelines for plasma spray equipment.  ***
