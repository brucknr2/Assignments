Abstract    :
              9415530  Rappaport       The problem of providing numerous mobile platforms with
               reliable switched communications over large areas is a major  current
              world-wide technological challenge with significant  hurdles. Network messages
              can be a mixture of voice, data, and  stream traffic, and the mobile platforms
              may have various  communications needs and mobility characteristics. With
              limited  communication resources to service large populations essentially 
              everywhere, the need to create suitable networking concepts along  with
              analytical models and methodology that permit theoretical  prediction of system
              performance, examination of parameter  trade-offs, and cohesive views of
              relevant issues is acute. The  physical complexity of potential systems and
              schemes sometimes  makes analytical tractability elusive and limits the
              perspective  and insight that is often gained from such models. The objective
              of  the research is to devise new techniques and schemes that are  suitable for
              mobile communications and to develop tractable models  for performance analysis
              and comparisons. Computer simulation will  be used as a validation and
              supporting tool.  Of particular  interest, from the viewpoint of networking,
              are techniques that  provide intelligent features in the sense that they enable
              mobile  networks to maintain performance levels by adjusting and adapting  to
              changes in the communications environment.  Dynamic control,  assignment, and
              management of communications resources in  consideration of traffic loading,
              interference, and topology will  be investigated for cellular and non-cellular
              configurations.   General areas to be investigated include: techniques for
              managing  hand-offs of communicating platforms; use of spatial  macro-diversity
              features; and dynamic control and assignment of  communications assets -
              including both borrowing and sharing of  channels and gateways. Procedures to
              accomplish this may involve  mixtures of central and distributed control.
              Specific topics are:  overall traffic pe rformance for cellular communication
              systems with  hand-off; cellular systems with mixed call and platform types; 
              hierarchically overlaid cellular architectures; combined channel  and gateway
              borrowing; and autonomous channel assignment schemes.  Appropriateness of the
              techniques in various access technologies   will be considered. The research
              will emphasize the creation of  analytically tractable models. This approach
              helps to establish a  foundation that provides fundamental insights and fosters
              the  invention of new and improved techniques of a particular genre. It  is
              expected that as a result of this investigation, new techniques  will be
              devised that will allow improved communications with large  numbers of mobile
              platforms over wide geographical areas. In  addition, the analytical models and
              approach will provide an  enhanced foundation for understanding and designing
              mobile  communications networks.  ***
