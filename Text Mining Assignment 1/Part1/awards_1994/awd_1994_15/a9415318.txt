Abstract    :
              9415318  Ergas  This is an award to support preliminary work on the  potential
              use of hydrophobic membranes in a biofiltration  process for removing volatile
              organic potential air  pollutants from gaseous byproducts of chemical and
              process  industries.  The investigator plans on designing a  laboratory scale
              membrane biofiltration system that will  utilize either microporous or dense
              polymer hollow-fiber  membranes to transfer the target volatile organic
              substances  to a liquid medium.  Biodegradation of the compounds is  expected
              to occur on the membrane as well as in the liquid  phase.    The proposal
              leading to this award was submitted in response  to NSF 93-130, Research
              Planning Grants for Women.  Results  are expected to provide information that
              can be used in  determining the feasibility of the process and the basis for  a
              more comprehensive research project that would determine  conditions and
              engineering design parameters for this  process to remove potential air
              pollutants from gaseous  byproducts of industrial processes.  ***
