Abstract    :
              We have recently demonstrated that a new form of near field  scanning optical
              microscopy based on a small (e.g. 35 nm  diameter)Ag sphere, excited at its
              plasmon resonant  frequency, can achieve sub-wavelength magnetic Kerr imaging. 
              We propose to develop a suitably modified microscope based  on these Ag plasmon
              resonators, but specifically optimized  for high resolution fluorescence
              imaging.  We believe that  the detection of individual fluorophores with near
              molecular  resolution may be possible.  Example are given of exciting  new
              opportunities in bio-medical research that will become  practicable when our
              new microscope is operative.
