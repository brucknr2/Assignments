Abstract    :
              9415434  Metzger  This award to the National Academy of Sciences will provide 
              partial support for two pilot workshops in California and  Colorado,
              respectively, directed at widening the dialog for the  future environment of
              the Physical and Mathematical Sciences.  The meetings will provide a forum for
              researchers from  universities, industry and national laboratories and
              government  officials to discuss the impact of  societal change on the 
              mathematical and physical sciences communities. About forty  regional
              participants will participate in the two day meetings.  A summary report will
              be prepared summarizing conclusions and  recommendations, including whether
              such meetings are of value  and should be pursued.    Town Hall meetings of
              this type serve a useful purpose in  opening lines of communication between
              government, industry and  university scientists and policy makers. A better
              apppreciation  of the views of each is anticipated, ultimately leading to a 
              community better able to function in a changing environment.
