Abstract    :
              9415684  Cruz       The goal of this project is to develop new methods to 
              efficiently predict and control the quality of service seen by  heterogeneous
              users in an integrated services network. This is  critical to the development
              of efficient and economically viable  large scale high speed networks. 
              Statistical sharing can be used  to gain efficiency, but it introduces
              uncertainties in the quality  of service seen by users of a network.      
              Since the uncertainty that arises with statistical sharing is  primarily due to
              queueing phenomena, this will be our main focus.  Thus, one may view our
              project as a study on the behavior and  control of queueing networks.  Viewed
              in this larger context, our  work will have an impact in other vitally
              important research areas,  such as flexible manufacturing networks and
              transportation  networks. We will, however, be primarily motivated by issues 
              which arise in a communication context.       We will develop techniques for
              examining end-to-end  performance issues, and examine mechanisms for the
              allocation and  scheduling of resources. One emphasis will be on uncovering 
              mathematical structure of sample paths. This will have an impact on  the
              utility of performance analyses involving both stochastic and  non-stochastic
              models. The issues being examined are critical to  the design of economical
              large scale high speed networks.  ***
