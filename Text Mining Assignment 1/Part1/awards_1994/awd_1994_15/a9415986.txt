Abstract    :
              9415986  Ward       The objective of the CISE II-MI grant which this planning
              grant will develop is to provide the minority students enrolled in Hunter
              College of the City University of New York with a Multimedia Instructional
              Facility for Computer Science.  In accomplishing this objective a number of
              specific "strategic tasks" have been identified.  These tasks include the
              acquisition of resources, attainment of specific levels of recognition, and
              reorganization of infrastructure.  While different in nature, all are
              considered vital to accomplish the primary goal. Specifically, the tasks are:  
                 i)  effective allocation of new office space;      ii)  accreditation to the
              Computing Sciences     Accreditation Board (CSAB);           iii) 
              establishment of properly equipped core computer           science
              laboratories;      iv)  establishment of a Machine Learning and Cognition  
              Center     The II-MI award will be used to accommodate these plans as follows: 
                 i) provision of two 30 workstation based laboratories   and coordination of
              this equipment with envisaged   Software Design and Computer Architecture    
              laboratory sequences:     ii) provision of additional computing resources for  
               the graduate research laboratory;     iii) provision of a communications
              infrastructure to    link the undergraduate laboratories, research   
              laboratories, faculty and staff; and     iv) provision of salary support for
              the first five    years of a full time network administrator     position.
