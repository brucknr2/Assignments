Abstract    :
              9415131  Huray       This project is support of travel to facilitate academic 
              participation in the Intelligent Manufacturing Systems Project  (IMS).  This
              award addresses the need to provide an academic  counterpart to the
              industrial-based Coalition for Intelligent  Manufacturing Systems (CIMS),
              Designated as Academic-CIMS (A-CIMS).       The joint effort of CIMS/A-CIMS
              will enable academe and  industry to seek common goals and establish priorities
              for IMS.   This award provides for academic representatives to participate in 
              a West Coast workshop in May, 1994.  This workshop is a key tie-in  to the full
              IMS Program.
