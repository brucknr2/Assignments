Abstract    :
              9415377  Liu       This grant will provide support for several U.S. researchers 
              to participate in the International Symposium on Intelligent  System
              Applications to Power Systems to be held September 5-9,  l994, at Montpellier
              France.  The area of intelligent system  applications to power systems has been
              growing steadily during  the last decade.  Several interesting applications
              have been  developed;e.g., power system fault location,alarm processing, 
              restoration, security assessment, and load forecasting.  The U.S.  leads the
              world in this area of intelligent system application to  power systems.  This
              conference has active participation from  researchers in the U.S.  This grant
              will also enable some of the  younger faculty members in U.S. universities to
              present their  work to an international audience.  ***
