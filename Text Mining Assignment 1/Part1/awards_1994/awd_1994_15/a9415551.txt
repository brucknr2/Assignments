Abstract    :
              9415551  Leivant  This award supports an international workshop on Logic and 
              Computational Complexity on the Bloomington campus of Indiana  University, from
              Friday, October 14, through Sunday,  October 16, 1994.    In spite of a high
              degree of conceptual unity, the  interdisciplinary relations between logic and
              computational  complexity have not been as yet the focal point of any
              scientific  meeting.  Instead, they have appeared as subareas in various 
              meetings on Structural Computational complexity, Logic in  Computer Science,
              Feasible Mathematics, Database Theory,  Programming Language Theory,
              Mathematical Logic, Proof Theory,  and Category Theory.  The absence of
              meetings has hampered the  area's development at the conceptual as well as the
              personal  levels.  Important connections between the various approaches  have
              rarely come to the surface, and people who have joined this  research community
              from different background have had only  fragmented and incomplete
              opportunities to meet and discuss their  common interests.  The proposed
              workshop would, for the first  time, bring together this research community,
              with the potential  of infusing even greater vigor into its research activity
              and its  practical as well as theoretical applications.  ***
