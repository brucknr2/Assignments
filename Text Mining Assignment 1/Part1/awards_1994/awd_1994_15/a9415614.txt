Abstract    :
                This two-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative research in
              atmospheric and space physics between Richard F. Martin of Illinois State
              University and Dominique Delcourt of the French Center for the Study of Earth
              and Planetary Environments.  The project addresses the physics of the aurora
              borealis (aurora substorms) in response to solar wind variations.  The
              magnetotail region behind the earth is where aurora substorms are triggered and
              energized.  The investigators propose three computational/theoretical projects
              that address: (1) basic nonlinear dynamics of substorms; (2) applications of
              the model to the near-Earth magnetotail; and (3) consequences of the model on
              ions of  ionosphere origin entering the magnetotail.  These studies are
              relevant to understanding of space storms, which cause commercial spacecraft
              anomalies and failures, interruptions of power distribution and of 
              communications.    The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration
              background in basic nonlinear dynamics and magnetotail dynamical modeling. 
              This is complemented by the French investigator's expertise in ionospheric and
              near-Earth particle dynamics.  The project will further understanding of space
              storms and extend the work on predicting space weather.
