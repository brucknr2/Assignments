Abstract    :
              9415573  Loui   This Research Experiences for Undergraduates project will
              support eight to ten students per year in programs carried out during the
              Summers, for two years.  Students will be involved in research projects across
              the interests of the department faculty, including AI and law, computer
              visualization, DNA mapping, medical informatics, distributed computing, neural
              networks, parallel architectures, and others.  Students will be selected from
              institutions across the country based on selection criteria which include
              quality of background, research potential, diversity, and representation of
              underrepresented groups.  Students will be matched to research professors based
              on faculty and students interests and prospects of success.  The students will
              utilize all of the research facilities of the department including parallel
              processors, graphics systems, multimedia networking facilities, and the
              high-bandwidth switching network developed at the University.  ***
