Abstract    :
              9415897  Bray  In this project, the PI will deploy shallow pressure gauges in 
              three straits of the Indonesian Archipelago, Lombok, Alor, and  Timor, in order
              to measure the throughflow transport, its temporal  variability, and surface
              temperature, and salinity.  Work will be  carried out on an Indonesian research
              vessel in collaboration with  Indonesian scientists.  In addition to the
              pressure gauges, a  survey will be carried out using a towed ADCP (Acoustic
              Doppler  Current Profiler) to level the pressure gauges and measure ocean 
              currents along the ship track.  The work will be done in  collaboration with
              that to be proposed under ARLINDO (Indonesian  acronym for "Throughflow"), a
              joint US/Indonesian study of the  Indonesian Throughflow.  ***
