Abstract    :
               This award will provide funds for the renovation of chemistry research and
              research training space in Curie Hall, on the campus of Radford University. 
              This project complements concurrent renovations occurring in Reed Hall.  Both
              science buildings are interconnected, forming the science center at Radford. 
              With the renovation to Reed Hall, Curie Hall  can be renovated and used for its
              original purpose, laboratory research space for faculty and undergraduates.
              Research, performed by seven investigators, encompasses a breadth of chemistry,
              including the development and analysis of advanced materials, transition metal
              chemistry, organic  and environmental chemistry.  Presently  laboratory  space
              is limited and this project will result in dedicated space for research
              activities upon completion. The  renovations will  include the addition of four
              fume hoods, laboratory bench space, storage facilities, and upgraded HVAC,
              electrical and plumbing systems to seven rooms. The department has a
              long-standing commitment to undergraduate research, and this renovation will
              allow additional students the opportunity to participate in research projects,
              improve the quality of faculty research, provide a safe working environment for
              research and research training, and support curriculum changes that encourage
              more student and faculty interactions.***  |        H H     + (á?áG À F G ( n
