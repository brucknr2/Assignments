Abstract    :
              9415511  Levander    This grant is to provide partial support for a three-day
              workshop  entitled "Investigations of Lithosphere Architecture and 
              Development" jointly sponsored by the National Science Foundation,  the Air
              Force Office of Scientific Research, the U.S. Geological  Survey, and the
              Incorporated Research Institutes in Seismology  (IRIS).  It will be held in
              November 1994, in Taos, New Mexico.   The workshop goal is to develop a
              community organization which will  1) formulate a science implementation plan
              for new and innovative  study of the continental lithosphere and that
              complements and  supports the technical plan for seismic instrumentation
              developed  by IRIS, 2) provide a community forum for exchange of scientific 
              ideas and experiment design, 3) encourage scientific collaborations  within the
              community, 4) provide community-wide scientific  consensus on instrumentation
              needs for lithospheric seismology.  ***
