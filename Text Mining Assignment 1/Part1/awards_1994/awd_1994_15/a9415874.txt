Abstract    :
              The proposed research consists of several related modeling efforts:   (1) to
              delineate the implications of mutual coupling between  gravity waves and
              traveling planetary waves, including both wave-  stress modification of the
              planetary wave structures and modulation  of gravity wave momentum deposition;
              (2) to evaluate zonal mean  deceleration/acceleration due to Eliassen-Palm Flux
              Divergences  (EPFD) associated with the above planetary wave fields; (3) to 
              simulate various sideband oscillations associated with  tidal/planetary wave
              nonlinear interactions; and (4) to implement  a time-dependent nonlinear
              quasi-spectral model for investigation  of the transient aspects of these and
              other wave-wave and wave-mean  flow interactions.
