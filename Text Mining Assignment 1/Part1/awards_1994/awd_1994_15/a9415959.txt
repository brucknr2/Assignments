Abstract    :
              9415959  Drabek  This   project  focuses  on  disaster-induced  employee 
              actions,  including activities and decisions ranging from initial departure 
              from the work place to stabilized return patterns.  These actions  occur both
              prior to certain impacts (e.g., hurricanes), and after  others  (e.g., 
              earthquakes).  The project,  whose  primary  data  source   will  be 
              interviews  conducted  following   six   major  disasters, will provide a new
              empirical basis for both theory and  applications  in preparedness for such
              disasters as  earthquakes,  hurricanes and floods.  The project will fill an
              important gap in  knowledge, since no prior comparative work has been published
               on  this  topic,  and will also provide a new empirical  base  for  a  variety
              of training tools for both emergency managers and private  firm executives.
