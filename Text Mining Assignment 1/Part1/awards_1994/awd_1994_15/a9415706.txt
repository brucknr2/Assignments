Abstract    :
              9415706  Leu       The travel grant will be used to partially defray the travel 
              expenses of selective university participants of the 1994 Japan-USA  Symposium
              on Flexible Automation, which will be held in Kobe,  Japan, July 11-13, 1994. 
              The Symposium will consist of three days  of technical presentations, panel
              discussions, and keynote  speeches, followed by tours to major university
              research  laboratories and industry production facilities in Japan.  The 
              financial assistance will make it possible for U.S. researchers to  attend the
              conference and learn about research, development, and  implementation of
              flexible automation technologies in Japan.  It  will also enhance the ability
              of the symposium organizers to  attract top university researchers in the U.S.
              to contribute to the  Symposium.
