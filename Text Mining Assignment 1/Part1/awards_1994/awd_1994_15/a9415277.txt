Abstract    :
              This proposal seeks partial support for a nonprofit workshop to be  conducted
              solely for the benefit of researchers and practitioners  in the signal
              processing, telecommunication, and mathematical  statistics communities. 
              Participation from individuals in  academia, industry, and government will be
              strongly encouraged.   This will be the second such workshop on cyclostationary
              signals,  and will be organized by the PI (Stephan V. Schell) and Dr. Chad M. 
              Spooner of Mission Research Corporation.  It is organized partially  in
              response to the consensus among attendees of the 1992 workshop  that another
              workshop should be held, and partially in response to  continued interest in
              the theory and applications of  cyclostationary signals among researchers and
              practitioners in  academia, industry, and government.    NSF support of this
              workshop would be used exclusively to encourage  recent Ph.D.'s and graduate
              students working in the field to attend  the workshop.  This encouragement
              would be accomplished by  providing an offset to the travel expenses incurred
              by these  participants.
