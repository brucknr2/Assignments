Abstract    :
              9415352  Mistree       This project supports professors from aerospace, civil, 
              engineering sciences, and mechanics to present workshop at the 1994  ASME
              Design Theory and Methodology Conference, in The Development  and Use of
              Multimedia in Design Education and Research.  There will  be a CD-ROM  made of
              this program and it will be available to the  design theory and methodology
              community.       This will help to foster cross-fertilization amongst 
              disciplines. This is based on the belief that there is benefit in  bringing
              together people from different disciplines to share their  visions and
              expertise with mechanical engineers.
