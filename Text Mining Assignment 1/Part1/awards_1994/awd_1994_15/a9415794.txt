Abstract    :
              This project aims to study the structure and dynamics of high latitude auroral
              arcs using data from the Sondrestrom  incoherent scatter radar and an all-sky
              imaging photometer.  The study will also make use of simultaneous and 
              coincident low and mid-altitude in-situ satellite measurements of plasmas and
              fields to quantify electrodynamic  parameters involved in
              magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling.  The main objectives of this project are to
              study (1)  the electrical structure near high latitude arcs with emphasis on
              the relative motion between the arc and the ambient  plasma, (2) the
              relationship between radar, optical and satellite signatures of arcs, and (3)
              quiet time temporal and  spatial variations of auroral structures.  A future
              campaign is planned in which radar and optical measurements will  be made in
              coordination with overpasses of the NASA FAST Small Explorer satellite.
