Abstract    :
              The investigator proposes a program of upper atmospheric dynamics  studies at
              Millstone Hill Observatory using a Fabry-Perot  interferometer in the form of
              an all-sky Doppler interferometer  instrument.  The research will provide rapid
              determinations of  neutral wind and temperature fields over a large regional
              area.   The three regions to be studied are the upper thermosphere, lower 
              thermosphere, and mesopause.  The investigator will determine the  climatology
              of each by systematic measurements of the wind and  temperature fields over the
              seasons and solar cycle.
