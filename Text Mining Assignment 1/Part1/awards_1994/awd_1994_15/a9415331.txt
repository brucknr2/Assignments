Abstract    :
              9415331 Fultz   In this research, Mossbauer diffraction is applied to powder
              structure characterization.  Hyperfine interactions cause the scattering factor
              of an 57iron atom to change strongly for slightly different gamma ray energies.
               This could provide a basis for unique chemical selectivity in diffraction
              experiments.  The chemical selectivity could be used to tune a gamma ray to the
              specific chemical environment of an 57iron atom and determine a specific
              diffraction pattern from that chemical environment alone.  The experimental
              work attempts to measure the face-centered cubic and simple cubic diffraction
              patterns from two iron sites in DO3-ordered 57iron aluminide.  Preliminary
              experimental results have been encouraging and have provided practical
              parameters for the this work.  If these first experiments are successful,
              measurement will be made on the arrangements of antisite atoms in
              partially-ordered 57iron aluminide and in a B2 57iron - rhodium.  In a parallel
              effort, the timing capabilities of the position-sensitive detector will be
              tested.  If the detector can be operated with both time and positron
              resolution, later experiments may be performed at a synchrotron radiation
              facility. %%% To date, materials science has relied heavily on x-ray, electron,
              and neutron diffraction to characterize the structure of powders.  Mossbauer
              diffraction, which occurs by scattering of gamma rays from nuclei, is explored
              as an additional useful technique for powder diffractometry.   ***
