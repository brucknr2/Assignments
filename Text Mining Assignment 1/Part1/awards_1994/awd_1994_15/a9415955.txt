Abstract    :
              9415955  Siddharthan  Bridge abutments located above the ground water table have
               performed in an acceptable manner prior to the 1994 Northridge  earthquake. 
              However, their behavior in this earthquake was  clearly unsatisfactory.    The
              aim of this project is to critically investigate a number of  bridge abutments
              (damaged and undamaged) located in the area  affected by the 1994 Northridge
              earthquake using the ground  motions measured in this earthquake.  These
              investigations  address the following issues:  (1) Why did some of the
              abutments  behave poorly and some not?  (2) Is guidelines, and the modified 
              version used b the principal investigators in their recent study  adequate? 
              (3) Was there any unexpected contribution from deck-  abutment interaction
              forces?  (4)  Are there any anomalies  between characteristics of Northridge
              motions and other existing  excitation records (e.g. those used in the recent
              study by the  proposer) with respect to their effect on abutment behavior?  (5)
               did higher than normal vertical acceleration component present in  the
              Northridge excitations play a role?  ***
