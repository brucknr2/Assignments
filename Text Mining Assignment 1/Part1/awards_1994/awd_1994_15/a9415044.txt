Abstract    :
              WOODBURY  The aim of this project is to describe and analyze the grammatical 
              structure of Sipakapense, a Mayan language spoken in the highlands of 
              Guatemala.  The project will be the first detailed study of Sipakapense,  the
              only language in the K'ichean branch of the Mayan family that has  yet to be
              described.  The research will consist of twelve months of  study in Guatemala,
              working with a native speaker consultant to  determine the grammatical
              structure of the language.  In addition,  samples of naturally-occurring speech
              will be collected, translated, and  analyzed in order to study discourse
              structure in Sipakapense and to  enhance the elicitation data.  The result of
              the project will be the  student's University of Texas at Austin doctoral
              dissertation.  In  addition, a Spanish-language version of the results will be
              provided to  the Academy of Mayan Languages of Guatemala for use in the process
              of  language standardization.
