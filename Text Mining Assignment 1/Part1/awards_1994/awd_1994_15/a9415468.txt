Abstract    :
              9415468  Frisancho / Albalak    Air pollution is generally thought of as a
              problem in the  outdoor environment of urban areas in industrialized 
              countries.  In recent years, however, air pollution research  has shifted to
              include the indoor enviornment.  An enormous  proportion of the world's
              population lives in rural  households that rely on unprocessed biomass fuels
              (wood,  crop residues, and animal dung) as their major or only  source of
              domestic energy for cooking and sometimes space  heating. There is often an
              extremely high level of pollution  that results.  The few studies that have
              measured  concentrations of particulate matter from biomass fuel  burning in
              developing countries have shown levels that are  10 to 20 times higher than the
              EPA 24-hour standard, and one  study in India showed levels reaching 80 times
              this  standard.   To date, the extent and severity of health  effects
              associated with the burning of biomass fuels have  not been well established in
              spite of the large population  at risk.  The few studies that have addressed
              this issue are  at times inconsistent with one another and many have serious 
              methodological flaws.    In order to examine the relationship between the
              elevated  levels of air pollution and health, this dissertation study  will, in
              a rural area of Bolivia with high levels of  respiratory disease and biomass
              burning: a) determine total  human exposure to indoor particulate pollution in
              a high  altitude community and in a mid-altitude community whcih  will be used
              as a control, and b) explore potential  relationships between this pollution
              and respiratory  diesease in children and adults.
