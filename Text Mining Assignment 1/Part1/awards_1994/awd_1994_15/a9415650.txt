Abstract    :
              9415650  Dushaw    This project is to analyze an existing data set from the
              Acoustic  Mid-Ocean Dynamics Experiment (AMODE) tomography array to 1) 
              describe the large-scale, internal tide field, and to 2) determine  the
              barotropical tidal current field in the region.  The first  objective should
              help to understand the internal tide as a process  that might be responsible
              for vertical mixing in the deep ocean.   Understanding of the sea surface
              elevation associated with the  internal tide will help understand how tidal
              variations might be  alias into altimetric data sets such as TOPEX.
