Abstract    :
              This project will formulate a comprehensive and self-consistent  theory of
              electron and ion acceleration in impulsive solar flares,  and specifically to
              account for the near simultaneous acceleration  of electrons and ions as
              manifested by the approximately coincident  observed time profiles of X-ray and
              nucleation de-excitation line  emission.  The PIs will investigate in detail
              the evolution of an  initially Maxwellian electron distribution in response to
              an  applied DC electric field, taking into account wave generation and  the
              resulting feedback of the waves on the electrons.  They will  also investigate
              the parametric decay of these waves into lower  hybrid sidebands and
              low-frequency electrostatic waves.   Theoretical results will be compared with
              observations of solar  flares whenever possible to guide subsequent work and
              progressively  constrain model parameters.  This research aims to explain near 
              simultaneous acceleration of electrons and ions, as well as the  high
              electron/proton ratio in impulsive solar flares.
