Abstract    :
              9415263  Young    This award supports a 12-month Japan Society  for the
              Promotion of Science Postdoctoral  Fellowship for Dr. Timothy Young, Department
              of  Physics and Astronomy, University of Oklahoma  at the University of Tokyo,
              Tokyo, Japan.  Dr.  Young will work with   Dr. Ken'ichi Nomoto in the
              Department of  Astronomy on a research project entitled, "A  Parameter and
              Constraint Study of Type II  Supernova Light Curves and Abundance."    A
              systematic parameter study of optical, X-ray,  and gamma-ray light curves and
              elemental  abundance rations of Type II supernova (SNe  will be carrried out by
              the research team of  Timothy Young and Ken'ichi Nomoto. The optical  light
              curve gives information about the  progenitor star and the explosion dynamics. 
               For SNe 1987A and 1993J, X-ray and gamma-ray  light curves added additional
              constraints to  fitting the optical light curves.  For this  study a
              circumstellar medium will be added to  the presupernova models of Nomoto
              (1988).  They  will be exploded in a hydrodynamical code  coupled with the
              Monte Carlo analysis used by   Kumagai et al. (1988) in order to calculate a 
              grid of light curves and abundance rations from  numerous progenitor models. 
              This data will be  used to predict SNe light curves to be observed  by the
              satellites Ginga and ASCA.  Current ASCA  observations of many galactic and
              LMC/SMC  supernova remnants (SNRs) will provide  information on abundance
              ratios and mixing,  constraining progenitor models and explosion  mechanisms.
