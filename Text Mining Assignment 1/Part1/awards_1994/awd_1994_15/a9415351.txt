              parallels to the robust adaptive nature desired in aretificial adaptive
              systems.  Some of these parallels were investigated under an NSF  researcch
              initiation grant and were demonstrated on two problems:  (a) on-line
              identification and adaptive control of an uncertain system; and 9b) synthesis
              of complex controllers using man-in-the loop simulations.  Experimental
              vertification using radio controlled aircraft is currentyly in progress.   
              This  project will extend the initial concept to include (a) analysis if IANS'
              capabilities  (completeness, robustness, and adaptiveness) and limitations (
              Computational speed, storage, etc.); (b) higher order building blocks
              identification; (c) inclusion of several micro-features of the immune system;
              and (d) explore its usefulness in adaptive critic functions.  As part of this
              project, a 'Completely autonomous remotely piloted aircraft closed-loop control
              system will be developed and tested.  Towards this goal, efforts are already
              underway with the development of  a dedicated laboratory facility at the
              University of Alabama.  Other  applications will include uncertainty management
              for spacecraft control and operations.  Immunized artificial neural systems, 
              when fully developed and tested, could be used in a myriad of problems.  Some
              of these are:  complex process modeling, high performance aircraft/missile
              control, autonomous UAV mission control, autonomous scout aircraft/rotorcraft
              operations,  complex design ad manufacturing processes, and autonomous space
              explorations and robot planning.  u st adaptive nature desired in aretificial
