Abstract    :
              9415482 Kou  The Bridgman process has been widely used for growing  single
              crystals of electronic and photonic materials, but dopant  segregation along
              the crystal, which degrades the crystal quality,  has been a significant
              problem.  Materials science research on bulk  crystal growth will be carried
              out to develop a better fundamental  understanding of  the processes associated
              with segregation of  dopants in the Bridgman growth process.  Two modified
              Bridgman  crystal growth processes will be studied, and their effectiveness  in
              segregation reduction will be evaluated in single crystals of  Indium
              Antimonide and Cadmium Zinc Telluride.  Flow visualization  of the transparent
              melt during the growth of Sodium Nitrate  crystals will be conducted using a
              transparent crucible and furnace  will be employed in these experimental
              studies to obtain additional  information on the mechanisms operative in dopant
              segregation in  electronic and photonic materials.   %%% The primary goal of
              this  program is to develop a fundamental understanding of the bulk  crystal
              growth of Indium Antimonide and Cadmium Zinc Telluride, two  important
              electronic and photonic materials.  Greater control over  the process of dopant
              segregation will allow higher quality  crystals to be produced, which, in turn,
              will lead to improved  device and circuit performance and reliability.  An
              important  feature of the program is the training of graduate and 
              undergraduate students in a fundamentally and technologically  significant area
              of materials and processing research.  This  research will contribute to
              improving the general perform ance of  advanced devices and integrated circuits
              used in computing,  information processing, and tele communica tions.  ***
