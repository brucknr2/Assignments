Abstract    :
              9415255  Steward    This is an award to support a FASEB Summer Research 
              Conference entitled "Sorting and Intracellular Transport of  RNA," to be held
              on the campus of the University of  California at Santa Cruz, July 16-21, 1994.
               This is, to the  best of our knowledge,  the first conference on this topic 
              to be held anywhere.  This is a timely conference on an  important and emerging
              area in cell biology.  ***
