Abstract    :
              9415996  Wilson       This project investigates a recently described error
              control  coding technique, called Turbo coding, which claims to  significantly
              lower the signal-to-noise ratio required for reliable  communication on the
              Gaussian noise channel, for still reasonable  complexity.  The research will
              study the baseline technique to  corroborate the initial findings, and explore
              the sensitivity to  such issues as interleaver design and constituent code
              complexity.   Improvements which lessen the delay, memory, and computational 
              requirements are under study, with the aim of making this concept  truly
              practical in contemporary applications such as packetized  wireless networks. 
              Also under study is the extension of the basic  coding ideas (component coding
              with iterative, interacting  decoding) to lower rate schemes, with an attempt
              to get beyond the  0 dB barrier on Eb/No.  A 'symmetric' form for the basic
              iterative  decoder has been developed and is under study.  More importantly, 
              the concept will be extended to bandwidth efficient trellis coded  modulation
              for the Gaussian channel, and to codes for Rayleigh  fading channels.  ***
