Abstract    :
              This research will assess the importance of electric field  variability as an
              upper-atmosphere energy source.  Data from  incoherent scatter and satellite
              observations will be used to  define the relevant temporal and spatial scales
              and to determine  the statistical characteristics of high-latitude E-field 
              variability.  This information will be used to parameterize an  additional
              energy source in the high-latitude thermosphere, for use  in general
              circulation models.  A coupled thermosphere-ionosphere  general circulation
              model will then be used to determine the  significance of this additional
              energy source for the chemical  composition, temperature, and dynamics of the
              upper atmosphere.
