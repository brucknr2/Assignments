Abstract    :
              9415422  Fillo      ABSTRACT      Manufacturing Experts/Instructional Video
              Modules    The State University of New York at Binghamton, in partnership with
              Cornell University, proposes to develop video-based instructional materials
              (modules and "video textbooks") with industrial experts in the classrooms to
              educate students in dual-use electronic packaging technologies.  The project
              will be closely linked with two university-industry consortia and utilize
              industrial and faculty expertise available through the State/Industrial
              University Cooperative Research Center on Electronic Packaging.  It is open to
              graduate students and advanced undergraduates as well as defense and commercial
              industrial workers.  ***
