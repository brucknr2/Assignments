Abstract    :
              9415738  Nigg  This project is being funded as part of the National Earthquake 
              Hazards Reduction Program's investigation into the causes and  effects of the
              January 17, 1994 Northridge earthquake.  The study  will focus on three cities
              in Los Angeles County:  Los Angeles,  Santa Monica, and Santa Clarita.  Data
              will be collected and  analyzed on the emergency response and early recovery
              activities  following the earthquake that will allow for a systematic 
              comparison between these three communities.  The study should  provide part of
              the basis for improving both disaster management  and recovery planing in
              metropolitan areas at risk to earthquakes  and other hazards.  ***
