Abstract    :
              9415124  LOFTIN  This is a project to develop a coordinated and integrated
              agenda  for scientific research on violence.  A workshop will be held in  which
              leading social scientists who conduct research on violence  will discuss ways
              to integrate studies from different theoretical  perspectives and different
              levels of analysis.  A recent National  Academy of Sciences report stated that
              federal support for  violence research was insufficient, short-term, and
              fragmented  across specific problem areas.  The report recommended a 
              coordinated effort with long-term support so that information  gained from
              individual projects could be developed into a  cumulative knowledge base for
              planning effective policies.  The  present project will provide the basis for a
              coordinated  knowledge-building effort in the conduct of scientific research 
              on violence.  ***
