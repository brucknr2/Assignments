Abstract    :
              *** 9415120 - Balamuth  -Elementary particle physics research, utilizing
              terrestrial particle accelerators and astrophysical particle sources, is
              conducted in space to be renovated in the University of Pennsylvania's
              Department of Physics and Astronomy.  ARI funds will complement the
              University's investment in renovating  laboratories for these areas of physics.
               As one of the leaders in elementary particle physics, the goal of this
              research is to discover the fundamental laws governing the behavior of matter
              and energy in the universe, including the structure of space and time.  The
              work requires a combination of laboratory experiments, astronomical
              observations, and theoretical synthesis.  Research space, built and configured
              for the needs of scientists in the 1950's, will be converted to modern
              laboratories that will house world class research and training efforts in
              elementary particle physics and astrophysics.  Principal components of the
              project are: 1) Replacement and upgrading of insufficient of nonfunctional HVAC
              systems; 2) Rearrangement of interior spaces to meet the challenges of modern
              research needs; 3) Replacement of obsolete electrical distribution systems; and
              4) Provision of dedicated detector and electronics test space.  This project
              will provide the infrastructure necessary  for present and future faculty and
              students so that they can exert scientific leadership in multi-institution
              collaborations that characterize modern research in the disciple.  The
              renovations will provide the opportunity to continue a high quality research
              program investigating important problems in the physics to objects as small as
              a neutrino, or as large as the universe itself. ***
