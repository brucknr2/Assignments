Abstract    :
                  ABSTRACT  Proposal Number:  9415550  P.I.:  Sadoway     The PI is making a
              presentation of his work at a showcase conference.  The meeting is called the
              International Conference on Cleaning, Contamination Control and the Environment
              for Industry, University and Government and is known colloquially as the "Mr.
              Clean" Conference.  This will be the 18th such conference which draws
              participants from domestic industry, government, NGO's, and universities.  The
              purpose of the presentation is to publicize the work that has been done at MIT
              under NSF sponsorship.  Potential benefits include (1) attracting industrial
              co-sponsorship of the research thereby leveraging the initial investment by
              NSF, (2) technology transfer, and (3) enhancing NSF's stature in the
              environmental industries.
