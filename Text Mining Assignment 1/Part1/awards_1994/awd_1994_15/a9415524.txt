Abstract    :
              9415524 Murr  This award supports Explomet '95: The International Conference on
              Metallurgical and Materials Application of Shock-Wave and High-Strain-Rate
              Phenomena to be held August  6-10, 1995 in El Paso, Texas (University of Texas
              at El Paso).  This is the fourth in a series of Explomet conferences which were
              initiated in 1980 and held in succeeding 5-year periods.  The previous three
              Explomet conferences culminated in the publication of three hard-bound volumes,
              which total more than 3000 pages.  The support provides registration support
              for 16 students to attend the conference.  Explomet '95 will also publish a
              proceedings to encourage a world-wide dialogue focusing on applications of
              shock-wave and high-strain-rate phenomena in materials.   %%% Explomet '95 is
              particularly unique because it explores aspects of military-oriented research
              which can have impact  on commercial and industrial applications and offers
              prospects for materials process developments which might be affected by the
              recent passage of NAFTA in North America.  ***
