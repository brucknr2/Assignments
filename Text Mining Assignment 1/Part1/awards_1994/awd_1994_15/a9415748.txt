Abstract    :
              9415748  Valavanis  This action is to develop an international cooperative 
              activities program between the U.S. and Portugal and thus,  with close coupling
              to other European Economic Community  (EEC) countries and with additional
              potential coupling to  Latin America countries - in the area of Undersea
              Robotics  and Intelligent Controls.    As a first step towards this major
              effort, it is proposed to  organize a two day Workshop in January, 1995, to be
              held in  Lisbon, Portugal, hosted by the Institute Superior Tecnico-  DEEC,
              with title, "Undersea Robotics and Intelligent  Controls."  The main objective
              of the proposed workshop will  be to allow the invited U.S. participants and
              their foreign  colleagues to identify specific topics of common interest  for
              long-term research collaboration.    The benefits of the proposed international
              cooperative  activities program for the U.S. will be many.  They Include:      
                i)   Coordination and integration of research efforts  in Undersea Robotics
              and Intelligent controls between the  U.S. and Portugal/EEC,         ii) 
              Unification and coordination of cutting edge  research in both U.S. and
              Portugal/EEC,         iii) Developing the basis for future joint seminars, 
              workshops, visits, etc., which enhance the international  perspectives of U.S.
              scientists and engineers, and,         iv)  Enhancement of the U.S. role as a
              research leader  in the area of Undersea Robotics and Intelligent Controls.   
              Finally, it is proposed that all related travel expenses for  the invited U.S.
              participants, be covered by NSF funds.  Expenses for all European participants
              will be covered by  Portugal and/or EEC educational funds.
