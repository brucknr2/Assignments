Abstract    :
              DNA typing has increasingly become a common source of forensic information in
              the United States and is currently used by federal, state and local crime
              laboratories. Recently, controversy has grown over how to interpret DNA
              evidence scientifically.  The debate about this issue must be resolved if DNA
              typing is to be used appropriately and if confusion in the courts is to be
              avoided.  The National Research Council is in the process of beginning a study
              to address the central questions, performed by a committee of distinguished
              experts.  The committee will include expertise in appropriate subdisciplines of
              statistics and population genetics, with additional expertise in molecular
              biology, forensic science, law, and social science, and other areas as
              necessary.  The study will emphasize statistical and population genetics issues
              relating to forensic DNA evidence and will pay particular attention to how such
              evidence is used in the courts.  The  committee will review relevant studies
              and data, especially those that have accumulated since the 1992  NRC report,
              DNA Technology and Forensic Science, and will  seek outside input from
              appropriate  experts.  The committee will meet five times during the course of
              the study.  The target date for  publication of the report is approximately
              seven months from the project start date.
