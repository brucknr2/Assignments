              Cognitive Neural Network Models that Bridge Levels of Abstraction          This
               is  the first year funding of a three year continuing  award  on  neural  net 
              models of cognition.   Such  models  must  provide  architectures  capable 
              both  of  representing  a  given  situation  at  different levels of
              abstraction and of  supporting  the  flow  of  information between these 
              levels.   This  project  explores  cognitive  neural  models that  can  bridge 
              levels  of  abstraction,  by developing a connectionist model  of  the  well- 
              known   cognitive  phenomenon  of  illusory  contour   perception  (perception
              of non-existent contour lines at boundaries of a non-  existent  occluding
              object inferred from context).  The model  of  illusory contour perception will
              allow top-down feedback from the  perception  of  an  occluding object to cause
              the  perception  of  illusory  contrast along the object's boundary.  The 
              model  will  explicitly  incorporate a representational  hierarchy  of  visual 
              elements  at multiple levels of abstraction.  Simulation  results  using the
              model will show how feedforward activation leads to the  perception of the
              occluded object at a high level of abstraction,  and  how feedback activates
              the units that represent the illusory  contrast.   The  architecture of the
              model  suggests  a  testable  prediction   about  human  perception  of 
              subjective   contours,  providing clues to certain mysteries of visual
              perception.
