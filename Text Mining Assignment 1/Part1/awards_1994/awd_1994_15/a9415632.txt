Abstract    :
              OCE-9415632    Gravity, magnetic, side-scan sonar, and bathymetric data will be 
              collected on the east flank of the East Pacific Rise between 15 and  20 degrees
              south.  This region has four anomalous features:   gravity lineations, abundant
              seamounts, asymmetric subsidence, and  asymmetric spreading.  The primary
              questions:  are whether there  are gravity lineations on the Nazca plate, does
              small-scale  convection in the Pacific asthenosphere bring about the anomalous 
              low subsidence of young Pacific seafloor, are the seamounts  symmetrically
              distributed about the axis, and how is the long-  wavelength segmentation of
              the ridge axis expressed off axis.
