Abstract    :
              This is a project to study the variability of plasma irregularities  that occur
              during spread F conditions in the equatorial zone.  The  work will be done at
              the Jicamarca Radio Observatory using the new  JULIA system, which is being
              installed there.  Jicamarca has been  the primary source of radar observations
              of spread F plasma  irregularities since they were first systematically
              observed there  over two decades ago.  However, the impracticality of operating
              the  complete Jicamarca radar at regular intervals for large stretches  of time
              has led to a rather sporadic record of spread F  observations.  The low power
              JULIA system that is being implemented  will allow more routine observations to
              be made.  The work will  include the development of experimental radar modes
              especially  suited to spread F investigations and designed to make the best use
               of the Jicamarca antenna and the JULIA signal processing hardware.   Software
              to manage the data acquisition as well as on-line data  diagnostics will be
              written.  Finally, a process for routinely  collecting data, processing it into
              a compact form, and  transmitting it to the CEDAR database will be established.
               A  complete, long-duration record of plasma irregularities over  Jicamarca
              during spread F would offer invaluable insight into the  onset conditions,
              dynamics, and transport processes related to the  underlying plasma
              instabilities.
