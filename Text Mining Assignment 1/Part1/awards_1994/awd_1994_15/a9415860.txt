Abstract    :
              9415860  Zeger       The goal of the project is to develop effective joint 
              source-channel coding techniques. The main objectives are to  achieve a deep
              theoretical understanding of combined source-channel  codes and to develop
              practical algorithms that can effectively be  used in real applications such as
              low-bandwidth video compression  and low-delay speech coding. Very narrow
              bandwidth transmission  channels, such as mobile cellular telephony, require
              efficient  coding schemes to protect the transmitted source information from 
              the corruptive effects of channel errors. Some previous work on  joint
              source-channel coding has yielded limited success at  protecting source coded
              information. In particular, low complexity  techniques are needed for low delay
              real time implementations. This  project will investigate channel coding
              techniques for source  coding applications with an emphasis on image, video,
              and speech  coding applications.  A summary of the topics to be investigated 
              is: Classes of low-complexity redundancy free codes for discrete  memoryless
              channels; error control coding will be incorporated into  the source code
              design and the index assignment problem will be  addressed for codes with
              redundancy.  High resolution quantizer  theory will be studied for sources
              transmitting across noisy  channels. Some preliminary results give useful
              formulas for  randomized index assignments, but a much stronger theory is
              needed  for optimal index assignment.  Lattice codes will be studied both  for
              quantization and channel coding. A goal will be to develop  efficient encoding
              algorithms for lattice source codes  (respectively, decoding algorithms for
              channel codes). Preliminary  results so far have yielded very fast algorithms
              for the Leech  lattice, as well as some of the best-known low dimensional 
              lattices.  Efficient decoding techniques will be developed  for channel codes
              in Euclidean space using specific source coding  information.  In particular,
              trellis decoding algorithms and theory  will  be studied for unequal input
              probabilities and unequal error  protection. This is currently an unsolved
              problem though extensions  of techniques from traditional decoding algorithms
              have yielded  some limited preliminary success.  ***
