Abstract    :
              94158099  Hibberd  Georgetown College requests support from NSF for connection
              of  its campus network to SURAnet.  SURAnet is the midlevel network  located in
              the southeastern United States.  It will provide  operations management and
              information services and it will  provide Georgetown College with a 56 thousand
              bits per second  connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits
              per  second) National Backbone network.    The college needs greater
              functionality and network speed to be  able to access supercomputers,
              libraries, and make file transfers  along with being able to implement a more
              reliable mail system.  Students and faculty research will benefit from the
              link.  This  is also a unique opportunity for the school to explore innovative 
              educational resources.
