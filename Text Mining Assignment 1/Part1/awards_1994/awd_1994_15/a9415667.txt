Abstract    :
              9415667  Dickey     The University of Southern California will undertake a
              project to  facilitate development, testing, and calibration of new and 
              existing sensors and systems for ocean science research on a  testbed mooring
              near Bermuda.  The goal of this project is to test  various sensors for
              long-term deployments as part of the Bermuda  Atlantic Time-Series (BATS),
              JGOFS, and GLOBEC global change  research projects.  The project will make use
              of an existing  mooring, Altomoor II, that is sponsored by the Office of Naval 
              Research.  The testbed mooring will serve two important functions:  1) to
              provide a platform for developing and testing emerging  interdisciplinary
              sensors and systems and 2) to provide high  frequency, long-term
              interdisciplinary data to sample variables  relevant to upper ocean physics,
              optics, biology, biogeochemistry,  and carbon fluxes at a site regularly
              sampled using ships and  sediment traps.  The project will initially focus on
              optical and  acoustic instrumentation and will foster a stronger working 
              relationship between instrument developers and ocean scientists.
