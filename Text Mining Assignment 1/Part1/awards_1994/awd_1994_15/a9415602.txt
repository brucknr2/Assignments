Abstract    :
                                           PROJECT ABSTRACT                                   
                                                 The overall objective of this research
              project is to  obtain accurate and quantitative data on decay rates of  marine
              viruses and a comprehensive understanding of the  mechanisms responsible for
              viral decay in the marine  environment.  Part of this study will investigate
              viral  decay caused by solar radiation, attachment to particles,  grazing by
              microflagellates, and bacteria degradation.  The  study will attempt to
              distinguish between decay rates of  viral infectivity and the disappearance of
              viral particles.  The study will also undertake of marine viruses from several 
              families in order to better incorporate the "viral loop"  into geochemical
              cycling.  The results should yield  important findings toward a conceptual
              understanding of what  controls viral dynamics in the marine environment, and 
              provide quantitative data for a variety of marine  environments on removal
              rates and the factors responsible  for the removal of viral infectivity and
              particles in from  the sea.
