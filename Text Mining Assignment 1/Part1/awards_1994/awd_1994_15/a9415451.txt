Abstract    :
              9415451  Barrett    This three-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative 
              research in nuclear physics between Bruce R. Barrett of the  University of
              Arizona and Piet van Isacker at GANIL  (Grand Accelerateur National d' Ions
              Lourds), Caen, France.  The objective of their research is the study of 
              properties  of exotic light nuclei away from the proton and neutron  lines of
              stability.  They propose to reach as high a mass as  A=11 in order to
              investigate the so-called "halo" structure.  Studies on large-scale microscopic
              (also known as shell-  model) calculations will be complemented by model 
              calculations utilizing the Interactive Boson Model-3.  Recent advances in
              nuclear structure theory and computer  technology will be applied to these
              investigations.    Dr. Barrett brings to this project expertise in shell-model 
              calculations and effective theory.  This is complemented by  the French
              investigators' experience in group theory and  Interacting Boson Model.  The
              project takes advantage of  excellent facilities at GANIL, including a very
              powerful  LISE spectrometer, and provides access to an experimental  group
              currently performing investigations on the structure  of exotic light nuclei. 
              These studies on nuclear structure  have important applications in energy
              research, physics and  astronomy.  ***
