Abstract    :
              During the last five years, an increasing number of  botanical collections have
              begun to develop specimen  databases within their institutions.  This activity
              was  fostered by a workshop held at the National Science  Foundation in 1989 to
              discuss trends and priorities in the  construction of botanical specimen
              databases.    In 1993, the MITRE Consortium released its report on the 
              information management needs of free-standing museums of  natural history
              museums and botanical gardens.  Also in  1993, the Department of Energy held a
              workshop to discuss  the development of community databases within the
              molecular  biological community and botanists representing various 
              institutions that wished to serve as regional centers for a  national botanical
              specimen database for North America  discussed a framework for such a project. 
                With these and many other projects planned or partly  underway, it is
              important that these projects are designed  to enhance interoperability in a
              distributed networked  environment.  This proposal requests funds to bring 30 
              botanist, other biologists, and information technologist to  discuss issues
              affecting the design of an interoperable  federation of botanical specimen
              databases.    The result of the workshop will be a report for general 
              distribution over the network as well as to the National  Science Foundation
              that will outline the infrastructure and  database design considerations that
              will guide development  projects in the selection or design of systems that
              enhance  interoperability.
