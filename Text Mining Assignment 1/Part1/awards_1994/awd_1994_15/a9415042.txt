Abstract    :
                Bonner Hall, constructed in 1965, is one of the major buildings that houses
              the Biology Department at the University of California, San Diego.  It is also
              one of the oldest buildings on campus and is overdue for major renovations
              required for the modernization of research laboratories for future decades.
              Current research space does not comply with new Federal and State health,
              safety, and ADA standards; is poorly configured, and the mechanical and
              electrical systems have reached their service potential and are in need of
              replacement or refurbishment. To accomplish these goals, funding from the
              Academic Research Infrastructure Program, combined with resources from the
              State of California, will be used to carry out a comprehensive renovation of
              Bonner Hall.  Specifically, NSF funds will be used to modernize and upgrade all
              research laboratories and support facilities in the building to enhance
              functional interactions between laboratories designated for Developmental
              Biology, Mammalian Development and Differentiation, and Mammalian and
              Eukaryotic Molecular Genetics.  Antiquated autoclaves, fume hoods, dishwashers,
              and other items of major fixed equipment, will be replaced and located in
              common rooms accessible to all users.  The vivarium will be upgraded to conform
              with regulatory mandates for animal care, and laboratories currently dispersed
              in other buildings will be consolidated, creating an interactive environment
              for faculty and students. Modern facilities are needed for scientists who use
              tools of molecular genetics to unravel the more complex processes of life, such
              as embryogenesis and differentiation.  Approximately 14 faculty members, 110
              post-doctoral students, 80 graduate students, 60 undergraduate students and 35
              staff researchers will benefit from the renovation. The project will also serve
              as a recruitment tool in the department's effort to increase the number of
              faculty representing minority groups.
