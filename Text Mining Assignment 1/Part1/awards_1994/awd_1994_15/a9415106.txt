Abstract    :
                The University of Nebraska-Lincoln is the recipient of funds, from the
              National Science Foundation, for the renovation of Chase Hall.  The Departments
              of Biological Systems Engineering and Agricultural Meteorology reside and
              conduct research and research training in the 75 year old facility.  Critical
              research needs, in the areas of global climate change, micrometeorological
              measurements, soil and water quality, waste management, and sensing and
              controls from spatial and temporal variability, necessitate the renovation of
              research space for the departments.  Research activities are currently  located
              in dispersed and inadequate facilities throughout Chase Hall, as well as in the
              adjacent Biological Systems Engineering Laboratories.  Funding received from
              the State of Nebraska  and the ARI Program will be used to consolidate and
              renovate space for these related research activities in one modern facility. 
              This effort will foster improved research interaction and facilitate the use of
              shared equipment for various interrelated research activities.  Five research
              laboratories slated to be renovated in this project include:  Climate Dynamic
              Research, Environmental Instrumentation Research, Sensors and Controls,
              Bioremediation and Pollution Prevention, and Advanced Integrated Data
              Management.  Seventeen faculty members, 19 support personnel, 3 post doctoral
              students, 106 graduate students, and 41 undergraduate students will be the
              direct beneficiaries of the modernized facility once completed.  In addition,
              collaborators from other departments including Geography, Geology, Biological
              Sciences, Civil Engineering, Horticulture Science and Entomology, and
              international colleagues will conduct research in these laboratories on
              specific projects.  The renovated laboratories will contribute to increase
              interdisciplinary research both nationally and internationally, a major goal of
              the university.
