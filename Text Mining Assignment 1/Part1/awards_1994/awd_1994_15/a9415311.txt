Abstract    :
              Freckman  Attention has focused on biodiversity in tropical forests and marine
              environments, but so far the soil environment has been relatively neglected. 
              Soil biodiversity in particular is of fundamental importance to many vital
              ecological processes, but the soil organisms are for the most part small,
              numerous, and poorly known.  For many taxa, our best estimates of the extent of
              diversity are provisional.  It is difficult, at present, to say which
              organisms, or groups or organisms, are most important in relation to critical
              ecological processes and soil attributes such as stability and resilience. 
              This proposal requests funds for 15 scientist to attend a workshop at the
              British Natural History Museum on soil biodiversity that will bring together
              representative British and American specialists.  The specific purpose of this
              workshop will be to:  determine the feasibility and scale of one or many soil
              biodiversity inventories.  The workshop will engender a multidisciplinary
              approach to soil biodiversity by bringing together systematist, ecologist and
              information management specialist o discuss the relationships between taxonomic
              groups f soil organisms and soil ecological processes and to consider how to
              carry out inventories of soil biodiversity.  A final report summarizing the
              workshop's recommendations and properties for research will be released in 2-3
              months to the scientific community and funding agencies.  The report would
              hopefully mobilize the soil systematist and ecologist to propose research and
              training for soil biodiversity and function.  Over the long term, results of
              soil biodiversity research would generate new knowledge and products for a
              diverse set of users (e.g., pharmaceutical scientist to ecosystem managers).
