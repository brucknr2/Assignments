Abstract    :
              This project is a study of the radiative, microphysical, and  dynamic properties
              of low stratiform clouds with the objective of  improving the treatment of
              radiative transfer in general  circulation models (GCMs) under varying cloud
              conditions, and to  improve the parameterization of cloud formation and cloud 
              properties in GCMs.    A low overcast ("arctic stratus") is characteristic of
              the Arctic  Ocean region, particularly in summer.  These low clouds affect the 
              radiation budget of both the free atmosphere and the sea ice  surface.  Their
              structure results from an interaction among the  large-scale transport of heat
              and moisture into the Arctic, the  macrophysical processes of boundary layer
              turbulence, and the  microphysical and optical properties of liquid water
              droplets.    In this project radiative cloud forcing and the transport of 
              momentum, heat, and moisture will be modeled using a recently  developed
              three-dimensional large eddy simulation model with  explicit formulation of
              cloud microphysics.  The model will be  extended by introducing an adaptive
              grid near the top of the cloud  layer, and adapting a two stream radiative
              scheme to parameterize  cloud inhomogeneities and their effect on the radiation
              field.
