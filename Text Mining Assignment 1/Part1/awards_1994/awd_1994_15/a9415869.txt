Abstract    :
              Baker  9417011    This research program, involving researchers from Indiana,
              Duke and  Columbia Universities, proposes to investigate in detail the 
              processes involved in circulation of hydrothermal fluids in a  heavily
              sedimented setting adjacent to active hot springs on Juan  de Fuca Ridge, a
              mid-ocean ridge spreading center located off  Oregon, Washington and western
              Canada.  The specific programs  proposed for the one-month field effort include
              studies of heat,  chemical and fluid transport within the sedimentary section
              and the  physical properties of those sediments.  The objective in acquiring 
              this detailed, multicomponent data set is to use these three  interdependent
              components to constrain and define models of the  fluid pathways and chemical
              reactions, including the deposition of  sulfide minerals within the mud and
              rock overlying the thermal  vents.  The detailed program is possible in part
              because it uses  cutting edge technology for heat flow and pore water
              measurement,  which this group of investigators has been instrumental in 
              fostering and bringing to use.  Previous study at the two proposed  sites
              includes drilling by the NSF-sponsored Ocean Drilling Program  vessel JOIDES
              Resolution, and the new data allows extrapolation of  results both areally
              (with new measurements from the upper 20  meters of the sediments) and with
              depth (with existing drilling  data and planned future drill data, which is
              expected in the 1996-  97 time frame) to define the 3-dimensional architecture
              of  circulation and mineralization.  In addition to providing the first  study
              at this level of detail over sedimented hot springs known to  produce large
              mineralized deposits, the program will provide  valuable data for precise
              selection of sites for future drilling.
