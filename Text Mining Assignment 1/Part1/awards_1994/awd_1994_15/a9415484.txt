Abstract    :
              9415484  Chapman    This study will extend ideas from previous investigations 
              based on a linear unstratified model.  The previous study  revealed a new
              mechanism by which mesoscale features can be  generated when the slope current
              is entirely stable.  This  new mechanism results from the scattering of
              coastally  trapped waves (CTWs) by variations in the topography and  coastline
              in the presence of a stable, narrow mean current  over the continental slope. 
              The extended work will be based  on more realistic situations through the use
              of a primitive  equation model.  The main processes to be studied are: (1) 
              adjustment of the slope current to the scattering  topography; (2) interaction
              between changes in the current  structure with the CTWs; and, (3) importance of
               instabilities in the mean current on the generation of  mesoscale flow.
