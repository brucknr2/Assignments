Abstract    :
                        ABSTRACT      Detailed spatial  information is needed at several
              scales to  aid  in modeling fluxes of greenhouse  gases from arctic  systems as
              part  of the Land-Atmosphere-Ice Interactions  (LAII) component of the Arctic
              System Science (ARCSS) Flux  Study.   A hierarchic  geographic information
              system (HGIS)  has been made for the Flux Study research sites at Toolik  Lake
              and Imnavait Creek, Alaska and it is now essential to  make this information
              easily available to ARCSS researchers  and other scientists.  The proposed
              project  consists of two  parts:  (1) preparation and publication of a
              geobotanical  atlas of the Toolik Lake and Imnavait Creek region, and (2)  an
              upgrade of the existing GIS facility at the Institute of  Arctic  and Alpine
              Research in order to accomplish the first  objective.  The atlas will focus on
              research areas at Toolik  Lake and Imnavait Creek.  The atlas would contain the
              maps  and supporting information in two forms, hard copy color  maps, and
              digital format on a CD-ROM.
