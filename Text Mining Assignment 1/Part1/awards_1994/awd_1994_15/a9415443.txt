Abstract    :
                A key problem in programming languages is the design and  implementation of a
              balance between static (compile-time) and  dynamic  (run-time) phases of
              computation.  A good balance allows  the generation of good  code without an
              undue burden on  programmers or compilers.  Finding this balance  relies
              critically  on intuition and experimentation, but these methods are not  enough
              by themselves.  As type systems and optimizing  transformations have  become
              more sophisticated, it has become  essential to provide rigorous means to 
              express static/dynamic  relationships at suitable levels of abstraction. 
              Programmers and  compiler writers rely on these relationships, so a precise but
               approachable description of them is important.  Using intuition  and 
              experimentation alone may allow errors or valuable  opportunities for 
              generalization to go unnoticed.    The goal of this project is to develop and 
              apply techniques for  rigorously expressing and proving the relationships 
              between  static and dynamic semantics of programming languages.  Primary 
              objectives include (i) finding ways to specify meanings at levels  of 
              abstraction suitable for reasoning about sharing, copying, and  liveness; (ii) 
              developing ways to represent and manipulate  semantic specifications in a
              formal  manner; (iii) aiding the  development of new interface definition
              languages by  formulating  techniques for describing the properties that
              compatibility of  modules guarantees for systems that integrate them.
