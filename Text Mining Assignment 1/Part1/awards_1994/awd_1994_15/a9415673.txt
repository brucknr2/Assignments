Abstract    :
              This three-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative research in chemical
              engineering between John F. Brady of the California Institute of Technology and
              Georges Bossis of the University of Nice.  The objectives of their research are
              to demonstrate that short-term range repulsion does not change the rheological
              behavior of hard-sphere suspensions, and to determine the minimum size of a
              particle which can be used in electrorheological fluids without melting the
              chemical chains.  The research involves the use of Stokesian dynamics.  The
              will work on a third, but related project, a monograph on suspension of
              dynamics.  The U.S. and French investigators have a long-standing collaboration
              and are co-inventors of Stokesian dynamics.  The U.S. investigator and his
              group will carry out the electrorheological fluid simulations.  This will be
              complemented by French investigators work on the simulations of short-term
              range repulsions.  The project will advance our understanding of the physics of
              suspensions and their role in the engineering of new materials.
