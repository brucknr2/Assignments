Abstract    :
              DMS-9415657  Totik    Totik will investigate several problems in the general
              areas of approximation theory with special interest in applications of
              potentials and in polynomials.   The main topics include logarithmic potentials
              in the presence of an external field, polynomial approximation with varying
              weights, fast decreasing polynomials, asymptotic for orthogonal polynomials,
              zeros of polynomials, and approximation by positive operators.     Harmonic
              analysis combines those elements of mathematics  best exemplifying the ideas of
              synthesis.  One seeks to decompose  complex problems into fundamental
              components.  These components  are then analyzed for their basic
              characteristics.  Finally, the  solution is reconstructed through a
              recombination of the  components.  The Fourier series and Fourier transform are
               examples of tools used in this context; one discrete , the other  representing
              a continuous decomposition.  Orthogonal polynomials  play an important role in
              certain segments of harmonic analysis  because (a) they arise naturally in the
              study of differential  equations (b) they can be used to represent large
              classes of  functions and (c) they are often easily computable.
