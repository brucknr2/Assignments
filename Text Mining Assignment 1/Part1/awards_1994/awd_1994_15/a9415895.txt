Abstract    :
              This project involves the study of atmospheric gravity waves (AGWs)  using
              airglow imaging data.  Gravity waves are important to the  mesopause region
              for, among other things, their effect on dynamics  as well as a provision of a
              major energy source for the region.   This is a true CEDAR link coupling the
              troposphere to the middle  and upper atmosphere.  AGWs, primarily generated in
              the  troposphere, propagate horizontally and vertically to the upper 
              mesosphere and lower thermosphere, causing perturbations to the  atmospheric
              airglow layers.  These perturbations act as tracers of  the AGWs as they
              provide a signature for their horizontal  wavelength, apparent phase speed,
              source directions, amplitude, and  related wave parameters.  This project, a
              follow-up study to the  ANLC/ALOHA program, will continue the evolution of
              gravity wave  exploration through participation in the Starfire Optical Range 
              Experiment, a measurement program at Utah State University and the  Bear Lake
              Observatory, and a study of the sources of AGW through  analysis of phase
              fronts from the all-sky data base.
