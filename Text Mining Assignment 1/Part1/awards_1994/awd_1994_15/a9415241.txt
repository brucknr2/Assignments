Abstract    :
                This project involves the dissertation research of a student of cultural  
              anthropology from the University of Michigan.  The project will study a
              pastoral people   in Tanzania, East Africa.  The question to be asked is how
              global processes of capitalist   market change have changed the local rural
              economies, specifically in the evolution of   cattle-raiding.  The student will
              test the hypothesis that closer connections with the   national state and
              regional markets have expanded the scope of cattle raiding.  Using  
              ethnographic methods of intensive interviews and observation in two rural
              villages as   well as the study of local and regional archives and documents,
              the project will analyze   how the increased commodity value of cattle has
              affected their importance in ceremonial   and prestige activities in these
              societies.    This research is important because in addition to expanding our
              expertise in this   important regional of the world, the study will illuminate
              the process by which the   international capitalist market expands into
              local-scale traditional areas, transforming   local practices into larger-scale
              commercial practices.
