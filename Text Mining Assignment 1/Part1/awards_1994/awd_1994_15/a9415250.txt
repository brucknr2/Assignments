Abstract    :
                      9415250  Pak  This Industry-University Research Project (IUCRP) type
              grant is to  conduct fundamental studies in the fatigue and fracture behavior
              of  piezoelectric materials and to characterize their performance as 
              multistack actuators.  The main emphasis in this project will be to  link the
              macroscopic material behavior with the microstructural  influences when coupled
              electromechanical loads are cyclically  imposed.  This interdisciplinary
              program will involve a university,  a materials manufacturer and an aerospace
              systems integrator.  ***
