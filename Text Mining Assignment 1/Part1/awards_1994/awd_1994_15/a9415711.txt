Abstract    :
                This three-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative research in
              condensed matter physics between Ivan K. Schuller of the University o
              California San Diego, and Alain Gilabert of the University of Nice. The
              objective of their research is to investigate the properties of superconducting
              layers with an insulating layer between them.  They will study the coupling of
              vortices, using an intervening medium, in order to develop and characterize new
              superconding devices.  The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration his
              expertise in sample preparation and growth and characterization of high quality
              multilayer superconducting and magnetic materials.  This is complemented by the
              French investigator's abilities in theory and experiment.  The calculations for
              the devices and the testing of the new material will occur in France.  Studies
              of superconducting vortices are important to both basic and applied research. 
              This will advance our knowledge of a novel state of matter and could lead to
              improved performance of superconducting devices in a magnetic field.
