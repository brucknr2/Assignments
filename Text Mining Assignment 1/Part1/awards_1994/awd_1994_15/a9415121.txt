Abstract    :
              The James E. Gleason Memorial Building, constructed in 1867, is home to the
              College of  Engineering on the campus of the Rochester Institute of Technology.
               Facilities within the  building are inadequate to support research and
              training activities in engineering.  As a part of an  overall project to
              renovate the building, ARI funds will  specifically provide support for the 
              modernization of 33 research laboratories for the Industrial and Manufacturing
              Engineering,  Mechanical Engineering, and Electrical Engineering Departments. 
              The renovation addresses  three major constraints to effective research and
              research training:  poor organization of space,  resulting in a significant
              underutilization of available space; inadequate environmental control  and
              mechanical systems, which adversely affect instrumentation; and outdated
              service facilities  that impact equipment upgrades, ADA requirements, and
              safety and security concerns.   Renovations will enhance existing research
              projects and enable the initiation of new research  activity in diverse topics
              including: advanced manufacturing technologies, neural networks,  optical
              communications and human machine interfaces.  The modernization will permit the
               college to meet the changing needs of its industrial and government partners,
              better prepare  students for continued study, and enable students and faculty
              to pursue research that cannot be  done in the existing research
              infrastructure.
