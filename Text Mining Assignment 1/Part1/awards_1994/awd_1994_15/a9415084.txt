Abstract    :
              ***  9415084  Addison    Central Arkansas University (CAU) is the recipient of
              funds from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program for the renovation of
              research and research training space in the Lewis Science Center.  CAU,
              formerly a teaching college, is an undergraduate institution, that became a
              statewide university in 1975.  In recognition of the importance of research,
              the administration has increased its emphasis on research by providing
              resources for the renovation of the science center.  One of the major
              limitations to student involvement in scientific pursuits has been the lack of
              available space.  Laboratories vacated by the Chemistry Department will be
              renovated, providing space to accommodate additional students in research
              training programs in Biology and Physics.  ARI funds will be used to
              reconfigure space and equip laboratories with fixed equipment including fume
              hoods, sinks,  safety showers, cabinets and benches.  The renovation will
              provide the science facility with  growth chambers, a tissue culture room, a
              radioisotope laboratory, a photographic and an experimental dark room and an
              acoustic laboratory.  The isotope laboratory and radiation materials vault will
              be upgraded to provide an isolated room for a neutron howitzer and a vacuum
              sputtering device.  Provisions will be made to furnish  research training space
              for nuclear and atomic physics.  The electron microscope laboratory will be
              renovated to provide access independent of an accelerator and for a clean
              operating environment. The modernization of the Lewis Science Center will have
              a marked effect on the quality and amount of Biological and Physical research
              that will be enabled by the renovation.  Not  only will students become
              attracted to the programs, but the newly renovated space will aid in the
              recruitment of new research oriented faculty at CAU.      ***
