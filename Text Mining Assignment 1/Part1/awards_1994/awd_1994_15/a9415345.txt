Abstract    :
              9415345  Brandt      ABSTRACT    RAPID PROTOTYPING IN MANUFACTURING EDUCATION   
              The Milwaukee School of Engineering, teaming with the Northeast Wisconsin
              Technical College and the Rapid Prototyping Consortium (RPC) involving Snap-On,
              Harley-Davidson, IBM, Outboard Marine Research, Kohler, Master Lock, and Lost
              Form Technologies, will develop twelve rapid prototyping teaching modules to be
              folded in the School's curricula based partly on the research into rapid
              prototyping sponsored by the Consortium and the experience of its member firms.
               Building on the ongoing relationship through RPC and good faculty and
              facilities, the project is focused on sterolithography which is of interest to
              the firms in an area of innovative and important technology.  The program is
              open to undergraduate, graduate and community college students.  ***
