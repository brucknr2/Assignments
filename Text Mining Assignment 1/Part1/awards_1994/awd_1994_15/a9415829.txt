Abstract    :
              9415829  STERN   The maturation of the U.S. Global Change Research Program  
              (US/GCRP) has placed greater emphasis on research on the human   dimensions of
              global change, including the policy sciences.  The   US/GCRP also is looking to
              develop more effective methods for   conducting integrated assessments that
              examine the nature and   timing of physical, biological, and human systems as
              well as   interactions among those sets of systems and policy options for  
              adapting to or mitigating global change.  Agencies like NSF that   collectively
              manage the US/GCRP traditionally have looked to the   National Academy of
              Sciences and the component parts of the   National Research Council to provide
              guidance and feedback   regarding planning and conduct of the program.  As
              human   dimensions research reaches critical new stages, the NRC   Committee on
              the Human Dimensions of Global Change will conduct a   two-day workshop to
              examine two closely related issues:    (1) research needs across the breadth of
              the human dimensions of   global change and in specific areas, such as the
              policy sciences   and methods for integrated assessments; and (2) strengths and
                weaknesses of various modes of research support (ranging from   support for
              individual investigators to support for centers),   including consideration of
              the relative balance among different   modes.  This two-day workshop will take
              place in June 1994 in   Washington, with roughly two dozen leading social
              scientists   gathering to share their experiences and opinions with respect to 
               these issues.  A written summary of comments will be made   available within a
              few months of the conclusion of the workshop   in order to allow others to
              benefit from the ideas presented at   the workshop.   Through this workshop,
              leaders of human dimensions and other   global change programs in NSF and other
              US/GCRP agencies will   have to opportunity to hear directly from leading
              research   scientists.  The discussions at the workshop also will provide   NSF
              officials  with valuable information as it develops plans for   possible new
              modes of research support to facilitate research on   the human dimensions of
              global change.
