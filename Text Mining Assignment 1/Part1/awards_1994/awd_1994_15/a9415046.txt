Abstract    :
                Russell Sage College, founded in 1916,  was commissioned by its founder to
              prepare women with a solid education in the humanities, arts and sciences.  In
              adhering to this charge, the Biology Department has continued to make major
              contributions to science through its recruitment efforts and undergraduate
              preparation of women scientists. The department's success, however, is in
              jeopardy due to inadequate facilities in Science Hall, a 30 year old structure
              that has never been renovated.  The building is not conducive for research and
              research training activities, currently being pursed in the areas of 
              environmental studies, genetics, cell biology and physiology.  Space originally
              designed for non-research purposes have been converted to research space. With
              NSF support, the College will reorganize research space in a centralized area
              to alleviate problems associated with the dual usage of space. Renovations will
              primarily consist of: providing dedicated spaces for two research laboratories,
              a herbarium, an instrumentation  room, and a prep area for chemical and
              glassware processing.  Consolidation of research activities in dedicated
              laboratories will  provide more efficient space for faculty and student
              researchers, and adequate space for instrumentation, assuring research spaces
              are made fully accessible to physically challenged persons.   Once completed,
              the renovated science facility will not only provide modern research and
              research training space for seven faculty members and students, but will
              invigorate the department in the historic and important mission of Russell Sage
              College in the changed environment of a new century.
