Abstract    :
              Goulden  9415322      This is a planning grant for Dr. Clyde Goulden to lead a
              group of  scientists to visit a potential research sites in Mongolia and  the
              Buryat Oblast of Russia to develop a long-term ecological  study.  The
              preliminary investigation includes the sites of  Hovsgol Nuur in Mongolia, a
              large lake southwest of Lake Baikal,  and lakes and rivers in the Oka and Tunka
              Valleys in Buryat.  The  purpose of this visit is to collect data on
              invertebrates (e.g.,  zooplankton and amphipods) and fishes throughout the
              Selenga  river basin and Hovsgol Nuur to examine the ecological  relationship
              between Hovsgol Nuur and Baikal Lake.  The data  available from these areas are
              very limited.  This trip can  provide important preliminary information for
              research in this  area, which has been accessible for outsiders to only a
              limited  degree since Hovsgol Nuur is situated in a remote part of   Mongolia
              and there is no road to reach the lake, and since only  Mongolians and Russians
              were allowed to enter this area prior to  1990.   Dr. Goulden is a
              distinguished scientist with an  excellent record in carrying out difficult
              field projects.  This  visit can provide important baseline information for
              carrying out  field research in part of Asia.
