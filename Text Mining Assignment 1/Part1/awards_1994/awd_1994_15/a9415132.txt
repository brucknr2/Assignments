Abstract    :
              9415132  Karandikar       This project is an assessment of the stat-of-the-art
              in  engineering design theory and methodology from the perspective of  both
              academe and industry.  It includes an extensive survey of  design researchers,
              both United States and foreign; and a search of  the latest research in the
              area.       This study makes an independent appraisal of the impact of 
              research which is funded in the design theory and methodology area.   This will
              help the research community to take stock of the rapid  developments in the
              field and to disseminate the findings to a  broad audience so that the impact
              of the developments of the  research efforts can be enhanced.
