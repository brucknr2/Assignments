Abstract    :
              This grant in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program provides   Purdue
              University with funds for the acquisition of an atomic force   microscope
              (AFM)/scanning tunneling microscope (STM).  This instrument   will be shared
              between the Purdue University High School Outreach   Program, also known as the
              Purdue Instrument Van Project, and the   conventional undergraduate instruction
              program in the Purdue Chemistry   Department.  In the former role, the surface
              microscope will be used to   demonstrate the underlying molecular and atomic
              basis of matter to high   school teachers and their students.  It will join a
              number of other   instruments delivered to high schools by the Purdue Chemistry
              Van for   hands-on use by students.  The equipment will also be used in the  
              Instrumental Analysis course taken by Purdue chemistry majors.  This   course
              has a laboratory experience in instrumentation at its core and the   addition
              of AFM/STM capability will greatly improve the quality of this   course.
