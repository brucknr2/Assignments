Abstract    :
              Originally constructed thirty years ago for teaching, approximately one-half of
              the Physics  building now is used for research and research training.  The
              building is structurally sound and  has been well maintained, but it requires
              renovation and modernization to outfit it for the needs  of researchers. 
              Seventeen faculty and approximately seventy-five graduate and undergraduate 
              students working in the  specialty areas of Molecular Physics, Condensed Matter
              Physics, and  Cloud and Aerosol Science research will be beneficiaries of the
              Facilities award.  NSF support  will address five areas of specific need: 
              reconfiguration of space to provide larger laboratories;  upgrade of electrical
              systems; addition or replacement (as appropriate) of central HVAC service  to
              all labs; addition of central utility systems for exhaust and equipment
              cooling; and substantial  improvement to safety systems.  As Missouri's
              officially designated technological university,  over 90% of its 5,200 students
              major in engineering or science.  The Physics renovation project  will be
              important to continued efforts to both increase student enrollment, including
              attracting  women and minorities to the program, and enhance the quality of
              research and research training  activity.
