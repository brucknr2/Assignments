Abstract    :
              9415790  SCRANTON    This investigation will be a biogeochemical component of a
              times-  series study of carbon cycling in the Cariaco Basin, a nature 
              depression on the continental shelf of Venezuela. Because of  restricted
              lateral water exchange with the open sea to the north,  this Basin with its
              oxygenated surface waters overlying extensive  anoxic waters offers an ideal
              opportunity to study organic  decomposition near a oxidation-reduction
              boundary. In particular,  this study will focus on the effects of carbon flux,
              sulfate-  reducing and methanogenic bacteria, and grazing of the bacteria on 
              the cycling of low molecular-weight fatty acids. The latter  constitute an
              important class of fermentation intermediates and are  key intermediates in
              carbon cycling under anoxic organic  decomposition in the Cariaco Basin and
              should be extensible to  other similar environments on the margins of the world
              ocean.
