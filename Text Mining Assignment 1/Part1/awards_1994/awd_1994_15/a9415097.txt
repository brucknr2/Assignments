Abstract    :
              Bird    The award will support the renovation and replacement of Marine Organism
              Culture  facilities at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington.  The
              institution has a  growing program in marine biology and is considered to be
              the lead campus within  the Consolidated University System of North Carolina
              for growth in this area.  The  Marine Culture facilities support the current
              research of ten faculty members and fifty  seven students in the Masters'
              program, as well as a number of undergraduates.  A  doctoral program in marine
              biology is currently under discussion, and renovation of  the ten-year old
              facility, which is limited by the effects of corrosion and inadequate 
              temperature control and air handling systems, will be an important element of 
              program growth.    NSF support will address required renovations in five areas
              of the seawater system  including improved water flow, distribution, filtration
              and temperature control;  replacement of the larviculture facility; provision
              of dry lab work space for the  benthic ecology projects; improvement of the
              marine plant tissue culture facility; and  restoration of the marine organism
              holding room.
