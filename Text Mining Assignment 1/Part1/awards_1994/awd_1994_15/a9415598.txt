Abstract    :
              OCE-9415598  Ledwell    A chemical tracer (Sulfur Hexafluoride) and RAFOS floats
              will be released to study vertical and horizontal mixing and stirring in two
              deep areas of the Brazil Basin, one in the interior and the other near the
              western boundary. The purpose of the experiment is to compare mixing rates at
              two different sites and compare the vertical diffusitivities to estimates
              obtained by closing a basin-wide heat budget.
