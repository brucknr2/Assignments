Abstract    :
                  9415985  Paerl         Previous research on carbon (C) dynamics of microbial
               mat communities has involved the quantification of C in and  out of the mats. 
              While these studies have increased the  knowledge of the collective C fluxes of
              marine microbial  mats, they have failed to take into account that mats are 
              composed of physiologically and evolutionary distinct  constituents including
              bacteria, cyanobacteria and  eukaryotic microallgae.  This research will pursue
              the next  logical step which is to discern the contributions to the C  budget
              of microbial mats by the individual components of the  mat community.  The
              distinguishing feature of this research  is the use of a mechanistic/functional
              approach for  identifying the principal organisms and ecophysiological  factors
              controlling the key processes in benthic microbial  mats.  Principal research
              objectives include:  1)  elucidating the ecophysiological processes responsible
              for  mat community structure and function, 2) revealing  mechanisms controlling
              microbial mat consortial  interactions, and 3) identifying species and
              functional  group succession.  Specifically the research will document 
              seasonal changes in the identity (taxonomic groups)  and  abundance (standing
              stock) of mat phototrophs and  diazotrophs using microscopy and HPLC methods. 
              C fixation  and allocation will be evaluated using 14C, O2  microelectrodes,
              microautoradiography and in situ growth  rates,  The primary ecophysiological
              factors (light,  nutrients, sub aerial exposure, etc.)  that regulate C 
              fixation, allocation and community succession will be  assessed in a series of
              controlled mat manipulation  experiments.
