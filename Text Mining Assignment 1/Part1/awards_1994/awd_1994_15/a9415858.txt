Abstract    :
              This collaborative research, proposed by Computational Physics,  Inc. and
              Southwest Research Institute, will carry out modeling  studies of the magnitude
              of and spatial variation in the upper  atmosphere's 1083 airglow emission.  The
              project will build upon  the investigator's previous exploratory work in a
              two-year effort.   The investigators will include empirical and analytic
              descriptions  of the attenuation of photoelectron fluxes upon passage through
              the  plasmasphere in the iterative calculation for conjugate  photoelectron
              fluxes.  They will also generate comprehensive maps  (latitude vs. local time)
              of helium distributions and resulting  1083 nm and 388.9 nm emission
              intensities under a variety of  geophysical conditions, both for revealing the
              sensitivities of the  airglow emissions to various inputs and for supporting
              the analysis  and interpretation of 1083 nm and 388.9 nm data obtained by
              others.   In the second year, they will assess line profile features for 
              remote sensing of thermospheric temperatures and motions.  Helium  is a tracer
              of upper thermospheric dynamics, so that measured line  center displacements
              may offer a unique test of general circulation  models of the upper
              thermosphere.  However, since the 1083 emission  peak altitude is above 400 km,
              observed displacements will not  constitute a direct wind speed measurement,
              but rather will reflect  the magnitude of lateral (ballistic) fluxes governed
              by latitudinal  and longitudinal gradients in density and temperature as well
              as by  wind patterns.
