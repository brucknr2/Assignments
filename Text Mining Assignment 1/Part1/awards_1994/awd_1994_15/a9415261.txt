Abstract    :
              9415261  Stringfellow    This award supports the participation of 10 U.S.
              scientists in a  U.S.-Japan seminar on Atomic Scale Mechanisms of Epitaxial
              Growth,  to be held in Hawaii from May 8-15, 1995.  The co-organizers are  Dr.
              Gerald Stringfellow of the University of Utah and Professor  Tatau Nishinaga of
              the University of Tokyo. The main purpose of  this seminar is to discuss
              fundamental chemical and physical  aspects of vapor phase epitaxy.  Leading
              researchers from both  academia and industry in the U.S. and Japan will
              interact and  exchange ideas that will lead to more rapid development of our 
              fundamental understanding of epitaxy.  Specifically, the seminar  will include
              topics on: surface physics, surface chemistry,  thermodynamics, and homogeneous
              reaction kinetics.    The U.S. participants provide a broad cross section of
              expertise  and geographical representation in the area of epitaxial growth 
              techniques, and were selected on the basis of being the most active 
              researchers in the U.S. Therefore, this proposal fulfills the  objectives of
              the Program in its exchange and transfer of  scientific knowledge through an
              international collaboration.  ***
