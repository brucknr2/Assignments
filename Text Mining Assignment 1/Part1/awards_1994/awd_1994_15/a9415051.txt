Abstract    :
              9415051  Tucker       This Project examines the manufacture of preforms for
              liquid  composite molding.  It focuses on thermoforming methods, where an 
              initially flat sheet is formed into a three-dimensional shape.  The  goals of
              the project are to understand the mechanics of preforming,  to predict whether
              or not any specific part can be formed from any  given random-fiber mat, to
              quantify the effects of preform  deformation on mold filling, and to
              incorporate these results into  computer-aided engineering software that will
              be useful to  industry.       This project addresses a critical and expensive
              step in the  manufacture of composite materials.  An improved forming theory 
              will aid designers in recognizing difficult-to-form geometric  features in
              their parts and correct the problem before the tooling  is built.  Designers
              will also be better able to identify features  that absolutely cannot be formed
              from available materials, and  thereby avoid development efforts that are
              doomed to failure.  ***
