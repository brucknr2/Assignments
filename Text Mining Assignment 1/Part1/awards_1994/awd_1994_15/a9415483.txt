Abstract    :
              9415483  Skalak   This award is to conduct the annual NSF Design and
              Manufacturing Grantees Conference.  The conference will involve researchers
              from the Division of Design, Manufacture, and Industrial Innovation and the
              Division of Engineering Education and Centers, both located within the
              Directorate for Engineering, and the Division of Information, Robots and
              Intelligent Systems, located within the Directorate for Computer and
              Information Science and Engineering.  The conference ensures that the
              individual researchers are informed about the ongoing activities of their
              colleagues.  An elimination of duplication of their efforts may be achieved and
              a degree of cooperation may result from this activity.  An overall improvement
              of efficiency of the research activity could be expected.  In addition, the
              conference program organization allows for ample time to discuss manufacturing
              research in detail with the collective research community at the meeting, with
              feedback to and input from the National Science Foundation.  Finally personal
              contacts between the grantees and program directors in the Divisions should
              contribute to clarifying many current issues in their work.   The aims of the
              conference are to enhance communication between researchers, encourage joint
              research, promote synergism, and develop networks for technical interchange. 
              Attendees to the conference gain an early access to the information
              disseminated.
