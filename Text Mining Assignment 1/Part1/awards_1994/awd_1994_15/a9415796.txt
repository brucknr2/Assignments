Abstract    :
              9415796  Shankar  The Renormalization Group (RG) has proven its worth many times
              in  the past, in relativistic field theory and critical phenomena.   Over the
              last few years the principal investigator has conceived a  way to apply it to
              nonrelativistic electrons.  The analysis has  yielded a lot of insight into a
              variety of seemingly disjoint  issues such as Landau Fermi-liquids, BCS
              instability and Charge  Density wave formation.  It is also a good diagnostic
              for those who  wish to replace Landau's Fermi-liquid with something else.  In
              this  research, a variety of new problems in quantum phase transitions  between
              various states like insulator, CDW, superconductor,  antiferromagnet; fermions
              coupled to gauge fields (as in the  oxides) etc., will be addressed using the
              scheme.  %%%  The investigator will pursue his goal of applying the 
              Renormaliztion Group (as tailored by him to some specific problems  involving
              nonrelativistic electrons) to a variety of problems in  Condensed matter
              physics.  The Renormalization Group approach is to  take a difficult problem
              and break it into smaller ones and do them  one at a time.  It is ideally
              suited therefore for questions that  arise in problems where strong
              interactions between electrons or  spins occur, such as in Quantum
              Antiferromagnets and High Tc  materials.
