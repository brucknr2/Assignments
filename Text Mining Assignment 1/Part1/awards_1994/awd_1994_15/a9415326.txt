Abstract    :
              9415326  Sullivan       This minority career advancement award supports
              mathematical  research on applications of linear codes to organizing and 
              classifying designs.  The work focuses mainly on the mathematics  of the codes
              themselves, less on the designs.  Originally work of  this type revolved around
              Steiner systems, in particular Steiner  Triple and Quadruple systems and their
              corresponding binary  codes.  This work leads to consideration of weight-one
              vectors  adjoined to the binary code of a projective geometry.  It is 
              conjectured that the new system is again a Steiner triple system.   While this
              is expected to be worked out soon, there is further  work to be done on the
              extension of this conjecture to extensions  where more than one element is
              involved.  Work will also be done  on the question of whether all Steiner
              triple systems extend.   This will be done by considering a relatively new
              class of  designs, the Bagchi-Bagchi designs.   ***
