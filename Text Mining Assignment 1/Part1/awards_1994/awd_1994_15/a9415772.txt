Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry   Division,
              Prof. Roseanne J. Sension of the Chemistry Department of the   University of
              Michigan will investigate the redistribution of energy in   condensed phase
              reactions of small polyene molecules, and the influence   of solvent parameters
              on this redistribution.  Simple diene and triene   species which serve as
              prototypes of complex bioorganic molecules will be   investigated . 
              Specifically, femtosecond absorption spectroscopy will be   used to investigate
              the cis-trans isomerization reactions of   1,3,5-hexatriene, 2,4-hexadiene,
              1,3-butadiene, and the electrocyclic   ring opening reaction of cyclohexadiene.
               The detailed mechanism of chemical transformation in fluid environments  
              remains among the most important unresolved problems in chemistry.  While  
              much attention has been given to chemical reaction dynamics of isolated  
              molecules in low pressure gas phase systems, the majority of interesting  
              reactions from a biological, environmental,, or engineering perspective,  
              occur in fluid condensed phase environments.  The research done in this  
              project will attack some of these problems in order to meet two goals.    1) To
              develop a detailed understanding of the role that the electronic   structure of
              polyenes plays in their photochemistry, and 2) to develop a   detailed
              understanding of the role that energy redistribution plays in   controlling
              polyene reactions since this is the ultimate factor in most,   if not all,
              chemical reactions, be they in condensed phases or in   isolated molecules. 
              The principles deduced from the studies carried out   in this research on
              prototype molecules  will have application to general   condensed phase
              reaction dynamics.
