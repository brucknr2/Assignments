Abstract    :
                This award will support travel of 12 U.S. participants to a U.S.-France
              workshop on Supersymmetry and Unification of Fundamental Interactions,
              Paliseau, France, May 20-25, 1995.  The workshop will cover research areas of
              supersymmetry, string theory and unification of fundamental interactions, and
              the participants will explore prospects for observing supersymmetry at
              colliders and in non-accelerator and dark matter experiments.  The organizers
              are Pran Nath of Northeastern University and Costa Bachas of the Center for
              Theoretical Physics at the Ecole Polytechnique, Paliseau, France.  The workshop
              will consist of theoretical and experimental presentations by established
              researchers and advanced graduate students and will include two sessions to
              promote collaboration among the participants.  A U.S.-France working group will
              be formed to coordinate experiments and ongoing collaborations.
