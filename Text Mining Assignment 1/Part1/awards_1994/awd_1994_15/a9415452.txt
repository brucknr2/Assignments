Abstract    :
              This proposal seeks funds for meteor radar studies of the  mesosphere and lower
              thermosphere using a meteor echo detection and  collection system (MEDAC).  The
              objectives of the work are to  provide an understanding of the long period wave
              motions, including  the migrating and non-migrating tides, and their
              interaction with  the large scale wind circulation.  The studies will use data 
              collected from the equatorial Pacific wind profiler network , which  has been
              augmented with MEDAC systems that allow the determination  of the winds in the
              mesosphere and lower thermosphere.  In order to  generate the long data sets
              necessary for this work, an upgrade of  the MEDAC sites is required.  Because
              the MEDAC requires the use of  a wind profiler that is often not optimized for
              meteor echo  detection, the PIs propose to design a new portable meteor radar 
              system that would stand alone.  This new system, as well as the  current
              system, will be augmented with new data analysis techniques  utilizing genetic
              algorithms.  A final aspect of the proposed work  is to establish a cooperative
              research program with the University  of Adelaide allowing experiments to be
              done on the Buckland Park  radars.
