Abstract    :
              This three-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative research in
              mathematics and involves ten U.S. university-based investigators, including 5
              recent doctorates, and an equal number of investigators in Grenoble, France. 
              The American and French groups, consisting of participants from different
              institutions,  will be led by Carolyn Gordon of Dartmouth College and Pierre
              Berard of the Institut Fourier, University of Grenoble.  The focus of their
              research is inverse spectral problems in Riemannian geometry.  They will study
              the extent to which eigenvalue spectrum of the Laplace operator on a Riemannian
              manifold determines the geometry of the manifold.  This problem is frequently
              phrased as `Can one hear the shape of a drum.`   General techniques for
              constructing manifolds with the same spectrum; questions of spectral rigidity;
              and relationships between the spectrum and the geometry of Riemannian manifolds
              will be addressed.  The proposal brings together mathematicians with
              complementary abilities and mutual interests.  The results of the project will
              have important applications in all fields of mathematics and for example, in
              signal processing and remote sensing.
