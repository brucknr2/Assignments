                                          ABSTRACT                                    AST
              94-15574  SCHMIDT, Maarten                This  grant will continue systematic
              surveys of quasars  of  very  large  redshifts,  in order to explore their 
              properties  in  the  first  few billion years after the Big Bang. Because
              quasars  are  highly luminous, they can be observed to larger distances (and so
               greater ages, when the Universe was much younger) than any  other 
              astronomical  object.  Since quasars  optically  look  just  like  stars,  the 
              main problem in finding them is how to  discriminate  them  from  stars.  The
              survey technique in this  study  involves  video  recording of low dispersion
              spectra, which in the case  of  large  redshift  (i.e. large distance) quasars
              will  exhibit  the  strong emission line Lyman-alpha. The survey is conducted
              like  a  census,  aiming for completeness to well defined limits. A  sharp 
              downturn in the number of quasars found in previous work beyond a  redshift  of
               3  indicates that the initial period  of  birth  of  quasars,  and  probably 
              that  of  galaxies  as  well,  is  being  observed.  ***
