Abstract    :
              9415578  Ipsen    This project will support a Workshop on Krylov Subspace
              Methods  and Applications to be sponsored by North Carolina State  University
              in Raleigh, North Carolina on March 17 and 18, 1995.  Krylov space methods are
              used for the iterative solution of large  systems of linear equations and
              eigenvalue problems that arise in  scientific and engineering applications.  In
              addition to work on  algorithm design and analysis by numerical analysts,
              engineers  and scientists study the properties and suitability of these 
              methods in the context of special applications.    The purpose of this workshop
              is to bring theory and applications  together.  Four teams of speakers will
              discuss in detail their  collaborative work on the application of
              state-of-the-art ideas  from numerical analysis to the solution of real world
              problems.   A team consists of a numerical analyst and an expert in an 
              applications area.  The tentative list of applications includes  problems in
              geophysics, magnetohydrodynamics, and fluid  mechanics.
