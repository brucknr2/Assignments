Abstract    :
              9415268  Laubenbacher         The investigator organizes a five-day symposium on
              Groebner  bases and convex polytopes, featuring a series of ten lectures by 
              Professor Bernd Sturmfels describing some of the central results  about
              Groebner bases of toric ideals and their application to  problems in integer
              programming and statistics.  These lectures are  complemented by a concurrent
              contributed paper session.         Polynomial equations are important in
              algebraic geometry and  commutative algebra.  Moreover, many scientific,
              economic and  engineering problems can be modeled by polynomial equations, and 
              polynomials arise in computational statistics, integer  programming, and a
              variety of other optimization problems.  The  theory of Groebner bases provides
              the foundation for many  algorithms used in the analysis of such equations.  So
              the theory  plays a significant role not just in basic research but also in 
              the solution of problems of strategic interest.  Increasingly, this  theory is
              becoming part of the standard curriculum at U.S.  universities.  Thus, the
              subject the conference is of interest to  students, teachers and researchers in
              several disciplines,  including mathematics, engineering, computer science, and
               operations research.
