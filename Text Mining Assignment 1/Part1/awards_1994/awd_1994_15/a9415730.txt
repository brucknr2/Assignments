Abstract    :
              This research is concerned with the role that regulations and insurance can play
              in  reducing losses from earthquakes, hurricanes and windstorms while at the
              same time alleviating the  financial burden to victims from these types of
              disasters.  The project is timely as there is a  concern by both the insurance
              industry and federal agencies such as the Federal Emergency Management  Agency
              (FEMA) about these issues.  The research will specifically focus on the effects
              of a  catastrophic loss on insurers and reinsurers.  The behavior of firms in
              the industry will be modeled  to derive a set of testable hypotheses regarding
              their future actions.  A set of empirical studies  will then be undertaken
              through case studies, surveys, and interviews with key decision makers in 
              insurance and reinsurance firms.  Hurricane Andrew, the single most costly
              natural disaster in the  insurance industry s history, offers an opportunity to
              examine the hypotheses by looking at its impact  on surplus, future premiums,
              available coverage, and ability to obtain reinsurance coverage.  The 
              prescriptive analysis will  contrast the implications of dealing with
              earthquake, hurricanes, and  windstorms where private insurers and reinsurers
              are responsible for covering all insured losses with  a policy that
              incorporates some type of federal reinsurance for covering catastrophic losses.
