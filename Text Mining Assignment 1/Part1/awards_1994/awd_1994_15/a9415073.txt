Abstract    :
              Abstract  9415073  Wichman    The triple flame is usually found near the tip of
              diffusion flames where on one side there is a lean premixed flame and on the
              other side of the diffusion flame there is a rich premixed flame.  The PI feels
              that the triple flame is extremely important in practical combustion systems in
              that it allows the diffusion flame to be propagated into or against an opposing
              flow.  The PI has proposed to study the intrinsic triple-flame structure of
              diffusion flames in contact with conductive surfaces so that the system becomes
              non-isenthalpic.  The PI feels that the triple flame plays a central role  in
              flame spread processes especially on solid surfaces.  The PI plans to examine
              the dependence of quenching distance on the thermochemical parameters, the
              shape and variation of the triple flame structure with stoichiometry, and the
              heat flux signatures produced by such flames.  He also intends to examine the
              influences of the triple flame structure on real, measurable, physical
              quantities such as heat flux and excess enthalpy profiles.  The PI proposes to
              use an analytical approach based on asymptotic techniques and one step
              chemistry between fuel and oxidizer.
