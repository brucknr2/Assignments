Abstract    :
              9415283  Lander  The objective of this proposal is to develop an optimal
              filtering  methodology based on the concept of the A posteriori Wiener  filter
              applied to a time frequency representation of a noisy  signal, and to quantify
              the performance characteristics on high  resolution electrocardiographic
              signals.  Frequently, in the  analysis of biological and other repetitive
              signals, it is  necessary to improve the signal-to-noise ratio.  Ensemble 
              averaging is universally used to reduce noise for estimating  these signals.  A
              posteriori Wiener filters are a class of  optimal filters which can be applied
              to any ensemble of  deterministic, repetitive, noisy signals.  They have the 
              potential to improve very significantly upon the performance of  ensemble
              averaging, with applications in many areas of signal  processing.  In practice,
              optimal filters have yet to realize  their full potential with biological and
              other signals.  This is  due to their nonstationarity for which no adequate
              mathematical  description exists.    The work carried out as described is
              expected to produce  fundamental knowledge in the field of biomedical signal 
              processing, and has considerable intrinsic scientific merit  beyond the
              specific application proposed for investigation.  ***
