Abstract    :
              9415491  Szpankowski       The research addresses the design and analysis of
              algorithms  for data compression problems.  The research will utilize results 
              springing from new analytical and probabilistic analyses of digital  trees and
              their generalizations, approximate pattern matching, and  algorithms relating
              to strings.  The problems investigated range  from the off-line Lempel-Ziv
              compression scheme, lossy extensions  of the Lempel-Ziv algorithm, to the
              shortest superstring problem  (lossless and lossy versions).  The main goal is
              to explore  second-order properties (e.g. variances, limiting distributions, 
              large deviations, etc.) of several existing and new data  compression schemes
              in order to obtain more refined information  about typical behavior of these
              schemes.  In deriving the results,  a technique, novel in the context of data
              compression, that belongs  to the toolkit of the "analytical analysis of
              algorithms" is used.   Initial applications to some open problems indicates the
              potential  of the approach.  ***
