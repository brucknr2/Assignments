Abstract    :
              9415666  Braun    General Atomics  "Proposal for the Creation of a Distributed
              National  Laboratory for Applied Network Research (NLANR)"  This award funds a
              twenty-nine month project to assist NSF in supporting  and coordinating
              research on the Very High-Speed Backbone Network Service  (vBNS).  The award
              provides for research scientists and technicians at each  of the five
              NSF-supported supercomputing centers which connect to the vBNS.  These
              personnel assist researchers who are running experiments on the vBNS  in
              setting up and running the experiments and instrumenting the network to 
              capture results, as required.  A Research Coordinator also schedules the  use
              of the network, assuring that the necessary equipment and  instrumentation are
              in place and that conflicts between experiments are  minimized.  The five
              centers are the Cornell Theory Center, National Center  for Atmospheric
              Research, National Center for Supercomputing Applications,  Pittsburgh
              Supercomputing Center, and the San Diego Supercomputing Center.
