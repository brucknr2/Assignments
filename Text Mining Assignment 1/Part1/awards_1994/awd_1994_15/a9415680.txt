Abstract    :
              This three-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative research in optical
              materials.  The U.S. and French investigators are Nasser Peyghambarian of the
              University of Arizona's Optical Science Center, Bernard Kippelen of the
              Institute for Physics and Chemistry of Materials in Strasbourg, France, and
              Francois Kajzar of the Center for Nuclear Studies in Saclay, France.  Their
              objective is to develop new photo refractive polymers.  They also plan to study
              the use these improved polymers in optical computing functions such as optical
              correlation.  Photo refractive polymers are important materials for dynamic
              holographic storage and image processing.  In contrast to existing inorganic
              photo refractive crystals, the polymers can be processed easily in variable
              forms (thin films, rods, fibers) and used in the fabrication of new photonic
              devices for optical data processing.  The U.S. investigator brings to this
              collaboration expertise in optical sciences, specifically, in dynamic
              holographic recording and photo refractive polymer fabrication.  This is
              complemented by the abilities of the French investigators in chemistry and
              materials sciences and their expertise in the synthesis and characterization of
              organic nonlinear materials.  Their combined effort will result in improved,
              efficient, speedy and sensitive optical materials.
