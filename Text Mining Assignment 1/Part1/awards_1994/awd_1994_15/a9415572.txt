Abstract    :
              9415572  Kadko       Hydrothermal circulation away from the ridge axis is an 
              important process in cooling and altering the crust.  The  principal
              investigator will join a funded cruise by Mottl and  Wheat (UHI) on the eastern
              flank of the Juan de Fuca Ridge.  He  will measure radioisotopes in
              hydrothermal fluids, sediments and  plume to determine fluid residence times,
              sediment accumulation  rate and various fluxes.  ***
