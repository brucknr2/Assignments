Abstract    :
                   Under this award, Dr. Barcilon will continue research aimed at 
              understanding the interaction between the largest (planetary scale) 
              atmospheric wave patterns and "weather system" (synoptic scale)  waves.  It is
              primarily the energy transfers between these waves  that governs the evolution
              of weather regimes in the midlatitudes.   The principal investigator will
              employ a simple, two-layer model to  explore the effects of topography and
              horizontal wind shear on the  flow.  Better understanding of these dynamical
              processes is  essential if improvements are to be realized in medium and
              extended  range prediction.
