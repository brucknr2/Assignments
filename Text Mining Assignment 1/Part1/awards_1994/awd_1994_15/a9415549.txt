Abstract    :
              9415549  Tesanovic  This project deals with the theory of superconductivity in 
              high magnetic fields.  In high fields, the standard theory  of
              superconductivity has qualitative and dramatic  deviations.  Entirely new,
              strong fluctuation, theoretical  approaches are developed.  The theory of
              coherent, gapless,  quasipartical bands formed by closely spaced, high-field 
              vortices is studied.  Resolving these deep theoretical  issues is likely to
              result in new physical concepts and  ideas which can be applied to a variety of
              other problems.  %%%  Many applications of superconductors, from manufacturing 
              applications to high-performance magnets, involve the  coexistence of
              superconductivity and high magnetic fields.  The standard theory of
              superconductivity no longer applies  for very large fields.  In this project
              the theory of  superconductivity in such fields is developed.  This work  will
              relate to recent experimental activity concerning the  conditions under which
              materials will be superconductors.  It will also compliment NSF's strong
              commitment to the  exploration of the high magnetic field frontier, embodied in
               the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory.  ***
