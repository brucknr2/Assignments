Abstract    :
              9415736  Borchardt  Current methods of predicting earthquake damage generally
              assume  that seismic intensity is a simple function of distance from the 
              earthquake source, as modified by geologic effects.  Preliminary  observations,
              derived from detailed damage surveys, show evidence  for north-south
              directivity involving a near-field pulse which  seems to have occurred during
              the first cycle of motion of the  1994 Northridge, CA, Earthquake.  The
              Northridge Earthquake,  having occurred on a thrust fault in a heavily
              populated area,  now provides a prime opportunity to examine, and perhaps 
              ultimately to predict, near-field effects.    The objective of the project is
              to test the hypothesis that  elastic rebound in the Northridge Earthquake
              produced an initial  pulse that was north-south directed in the near-field. 
              More  specific objectives are:    1. To relate the damage data to recorded
              ground motions.    2. To relate the phenomenon to the geologic, geodetic, and 
              seismologic aspects of the earthquake.    If substantiated, this hypothesis
              will have basic implications  for the future design of structures.  ***
