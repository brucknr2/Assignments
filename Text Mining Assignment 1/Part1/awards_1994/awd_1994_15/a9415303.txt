Abstract    :
              9415303  Andrews  The project addresses the problem of writing parallel programs
               that are clear, portable, and efficient.  The three common  approaches to this
              problem are parallelizing compiler, very high-  level languages and imperative
              languages or software systems with  a single communication model.  This project
              will develop a common  base of programming abstractions and underlying software
              that  simplifies as well as supports all of these approaches.    The center
              piece of the research is the Filaments package, which  supports efficient
              execution of fine-grain parallelism and a  shared communication on both shred
              and distributed memory  multiprocessors.  The specific topics to be
              investigated by this  project are:  1) expanding and refining Filaments
              package, 2)  designing and implementing MIF, a multi-paradigm intermediate for 
              compilers that will be both language and architecture  independent; and 3)
              designing and implementing a simple and  efficient programming language HPSR
              (high performance SR).  Filaments and MIF address the problems of portability
              and  efficiency, independent of the language used to write parallel  programs,
              and HPSR addresses the problem of program clarity.  ***
