Abstract    :
                  9415053  Mosallam  The main objective of the research project is to
              investigate both  theoretically and experimentally the behavior of frame
              connections  for pultruded fiber reinforced plastics (PFRP) using molded 
              composite connectors.  The focus will be given to the static  (short-term &
              long-term), as well as the performance of the  Universal Connector/PFRP
              connections under cyclic loads.
