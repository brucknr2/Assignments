Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9415686  Robert Dibble      This proposal is essentially for the
              continuation of the PI's NSF supported program on "Mixture Fraction
              Measurements by Rayleigh Scattering".  The objective of the proposal is to
              obtain experimental data that will directly improve the mixing models used in
              computer simulations of turbulent combustion.  It is proposed to investigate
              the effects of heat release on mixing (scalar dissipation) in turbulent
              diffusion flames and to make simultaneous measurements of the mixture fraction
              and nitric oxide concentrations in methane, and carbon monoxide flames.
