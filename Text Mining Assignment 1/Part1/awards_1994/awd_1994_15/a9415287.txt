Abstract    :
              9415287  Saito  This award supports a 12-month Science and Technology Agency  
              of Japan Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. Hiroshi Saito,   Department of
              Chemical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute   of Technology, at the National
              Institute for Resources and   Environment, Tsukuba, Japan.  Dr. Saito will work
              with Dr.   Atsushi Inaba in the Energy Resources Department, on a   research
              project entitled, "Japan STA Program:  Rapid Coal   Pyrolysis for the
              Production of Coke."      In the production of iron, coke serves as fuel,
              reducing   agent and binding agent and is usually produced by   carbonizing
              premium coal.  Due to depleting premium coal   supplies, the iron industry is
              focusing on utilizing lower   grade coals to produce coke.  A limited
              understanding of the   requirements for making good coke from lower grade coal 
               restrains production despite economic motivations.  Dr.   Saito and Dr. Inaba
              will conduct thermal coal pyrolysis   using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA)
              to study the   effects of pressure and temperature on the thermal   degradation
              kinetic rates of various grades of coal.  The   team will then utilize a
              free-fall apparatus to examine   particle distribution and size and to simulate
              thermal   degradation using the results of the TGA experiments.  The   project
              will provide kinetics data, mass transfer data and   models for low grade coals
              which can then be used by the   iron industry to efficiently use coal as an
              energy and raw   material resource.  ***
