Abstract    :
              9415656  Meyer  Technical abstract: This project concerns several related
              subjects  in  the  physics  of liquid crystals: colloidal liquid crystals 
              based  on  aqueous  virus  suspensions, molecular aggregate liquid crystals, 
              and  dynamical systems and pattern formation. These inter-related  subjects 
              involve   the  physics  of  liquid  crystals  at  three  levels,   the 
              microscopic  level of the molecules or particle and their interaction,  the  
              mesoscopic  level  of  ordered  phase  formation  and  materials  properties,
              and the macroscopic level of observable phenomenology. The  objective   is   to
               develop  fundamental  understanding   of   liquid  crystalline  ordering  and 
              its  consequences  in  the  systems  being  studied.   The  general  knowledge 
              gained  from  these  studies   has  implications for the synthesis and
              processing of novel materials, such  as  ultra-high-strength  fibers, and  for 
              potential  biosynthesis  of  materials in which self-assembly is important.
