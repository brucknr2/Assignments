Abstract    :
              This project will develop a realistic photochemical dynamical model  for the
              5577 angstrom oxygen green line emission.  The model will  couple the chemical
              production and loss of the oxygen emission with  dynamical wave advection to
              establish the transfer function between  the relative neutral density
              fluctuations and the relative  brightness fluctuations of the green line due to
              internal gravity  waves propagating into the mesosphere and lower thermosphere 
              region.  It will include the effect of a realistic zonal,  meridional winds and
              a realistic non-isothermal atmosphere.
