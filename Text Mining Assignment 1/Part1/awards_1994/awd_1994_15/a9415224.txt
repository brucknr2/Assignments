Abstract    :
              9415224  O Neill    This award supports a 12-month Japan Society for the
              Promotion of Science Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr.   Bridget O Neill,
              Department of Geology and Geophysics, University of California, at the
              University of   Tokyo, Japan.  Dr. O Neill will work with Dr. Takehiko Yagi,
              Institute for Solid State Physics, on a   research project entitled,  Japan
              JSPS Program:  Investigation of Oxygen Fugacity in Petrologic   Experiments at
              Ultra-High Pressures.     Oxygen fugacity is a petrologic parameter which
              reflects the tectonic processes of mantle samples.  Usually   oxygen fugacity
              is a controlled parameter in low pressure petrologic experiments simulating
              conditions of   the Earth s crust and to a depth of less than 70 km in the
              upper mantle.  The Earth s mantle extends to a   depth of about 2900 km,
              corresponding to a pressure of about 135 Gigapascals.  To date no attempts have
                been made to control or determine the oxygen fugacity at such ultra-high
              pressures.  Dr. O Neill and Dr.   Yagi will utilize the high-pressure
              facilities at the University of Tsukuba to adapt oxygen fugacity control  
              techniques to ultra-high pressure experiments.  The team will systematically
              conduct oxygen fugacity   experiments at pressures greater than 5 Gigapascals
              under different temperature conditions.  Their research   will not only extend
              the calibration range of geobarometers and geothermometers but will be useful
              in   maximizing the transition temperature of many high-Tc superconductors.
