Abstract    :
              9415223  Haines    This award supports a 12-month Japan Society  for the
              Promotion of Science Postdoctoral  Fellowship for Dr. Paul Haines at Waseda 
              University, Tokyo, Japan.  Dr. Haines will work  with Dr. Kei-ichi Maeda in the
              Department of  Physics, on a research project entitled, "Voids  in the
              Thin-Shell Formalism."    The research project will use the thin shell 
              formalism of General Relativity to predict  peculiar velocities of galaxies
              near voids in  the distribution of galaxies, and then to test  these using real
              data.  Dr. Maeda is a leading  expert on the thin shell formalism of general 
              relatively and Dr. Haines will work with him to  test actual data supplied by
              the 1.2 Jy IRAS  survey.  Dr. Haines and Dr. Maeda will study  the large scale
              structure of the universe and  will see to what extent the thin shell 
              formalism of general relativity can be used to  described the large voids found
              in the spatial  distribution of galaxies.  ***
