Abstract    :
              9415681  Singh  Description:  This proposal will support the  participation of
              three U.S. scientists in the  Indo-U.S. Research Symposium on: "Emerging 
              Trends in Vibration and Noise Engineering, New  Delhi, India, September 1995". 
              The conveners  are R. Singh of Ohio State University and B.C.  Nakra of the
              Indian Institute of Technology,  New Delhi.  The symposium will focus on basic 
              research issues and emerging technology in  vibration and noise engineering. 
              This is a  rapidly evolving field in which the need to  address noise pollution
              and to control noise &  vibration in quality products is well  recognized.  The
              meeting will address a wide  range of topics such as machine diagnostics, 
              modal analysis, noise control, smart actuators  and sensors, structural and
              acoustic intensity  techniques and nonlinear problems in vibration  and
              acoustics.     Scope:  India is known for  its excellence in engineering.  It
              is also a  future market for emerging vibration and noise  technologies. 
              Although many Indian researchers  are pursuing important problems in
              traditional  areas of vibrations, little research is being  done in other areas
              such as noise, sound  quality, and diagnostics.  No major national or 
              international meeting on this subject has been  held in India during the last
              decade.  There is  a clear need to hold a joint symposium/workshop  in order to
              stimulate cutting edge research in  this area among Indian researchers, and to 
              identify key research directions and mutual  research interests.  The
              proceedings will be  published.    ***
