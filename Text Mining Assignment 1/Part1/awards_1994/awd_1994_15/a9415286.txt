Abstract    :
              9415286  Sideris  Constrained H-inf optimal control (CH-inf) provides a
              framework  for robust control system design with mixed time and frequency 
              domain specifications.  In Choo, the frequency domain  specifications are
              formulated in terms of an Hoo-norm  minimization problem and the time domain
              constraints in terms of  hard bounds on specified time responses of the
              closed-loop system  such as step responses, etc.  The latter are expressed as
              affine  constraints on the solution of the Hoo optimization problem and  thus
              are treated exactly instead of being approximately converted  to frequency
              domain specifications.  The complete solution to  this problem has been
              obtained for general discrete time  multivariable systems and it consists of
              solving a finite  dimensional convex minimization problem (FDOP) and a standard
              Hoo  optimization problem.    The research will extend the current status of
              CH-inf  optimization in many significant ways.  More specifically, first  a
              Ch-inf framework in which structured model uncertainty is  handled with reduced
              conservatism will be obtained and thus an  even broader set of specifications
              (time and frequency domain  specifications, structured and parametric model
              uncertainty) can  be addressed directly.  ***
