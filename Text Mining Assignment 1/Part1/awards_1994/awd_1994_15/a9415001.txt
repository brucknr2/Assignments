Abstract    :
                9415001  Finger       The award is for creating a methodology for acquiring
              process  models of novel manufacturing processes using statistical methods, 
              physical models, and experimentation.  The process that will be  studied is the
              shape deposition melting process, which is a solid  freeform fabrication
              process.  The part is built up by successively  depositing molten materials,
              such as steel and copper, in thin  layers using a microcasting process.  Other
              subprocesses used are  thermal spraying, shot peening, and machining.  Only the
               microcasting and machining subprocesses will be studied using the  proposed
              methodology.  Statistical design of experiments will be  used to create coarse
              process models that identify important  process variables and relationships
              among them.  For subprocesses  not well understood at present, models will be
              developed based on  the underlying physics of the subprocesses.  Surrogate
              models of  different levels of complexity and detail will also be abstracted 
              from the detailed models.       The methodology to be developed is particularly
              useful for  studying the shape deposition process which is a rapid prototyping 
              process.  More conventional processes would also benefit from the  methodology.
