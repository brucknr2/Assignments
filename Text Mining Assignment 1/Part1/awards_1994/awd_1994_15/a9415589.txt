Abstract    :
              9415589  Schmitt  Full water column turbulence, velocity shear and
              fine-structure  measurements will be   conducted in the deep ocean at two sites
              in the Brazil Basin (near  the western boundary and   in the interior)
              concurrently with a purposeful tracer release at  3000 m depth. The diapycnal  
              diffusivity in the deep Brazil Basin will be estimated from the  observation
              from the   dissipation of kinetic energy and thermal variance, and the nergy 
              levels of internal waves   and the mechanisms supporting that mixing will be
              documented. The  microstructure-based   diffusivity estimates, limited by
              sampling constaints in space and  time will compared with   those obtained by
              the Ledwell and colleagues (OCE-9515598) from  their tracer dispersion.  
              Additional comparisons will be made with the basin-averaged mixing  rates
              determined from   the large-scale budgets of the WOCE Deep Basin Experiment.
