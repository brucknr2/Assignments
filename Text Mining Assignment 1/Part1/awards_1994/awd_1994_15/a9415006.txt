              for research programs  at the International Institute for Applied Systems
              Analysis (IIASA) for another three years.  IIASA is a multilateral,
              non-governmental institution located near Vienna, Austria which  was
              established in 1972 as a center for research in systems analysis, "in relation
              to problems  of modern societies arising from scientific and technological
              development."  Much of its  current research is focused in two areas,
              consistent with a 10-year strategic plan adopted in  November 1991: (1)
              analysis of sustainable development issues, including issues of global  change,
              and (2) analysis of economic reform processes.   IIASA is governed by a council
              comprised of representatives from 16 National Member Organizations, including
              the United States, Russia, Canada, Japan, and several Western and Eastern
              European countries.  is consistent with official U.S. policy, affirmed by the
              Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) by means of a September 1994
              policy statement which asserted U.S. interest in maint aining IIASA's
              capabilities.to conduct research with a regional perspective on issues related
              to the environment and on economic transitions in Eastern Europe and the Newly
