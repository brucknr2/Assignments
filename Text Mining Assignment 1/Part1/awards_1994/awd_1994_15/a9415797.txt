Abstract    :
              9415797  Messina    This award supports the infrastructure for the Scalable I/O
              national project.  This national project will investigate many of the issues
              surrounding the scalability of Massively Parallel Processing (MPP) System input
              and output systems.  The national project consists of 18 application groups
              involving more than 30 researchers.    The equipment provided by this award
              consists of I/O nodes for an MPP and a small MPP for crashable experimentation.
               The infrastructure will be available to all of the application groups for
              their experimental research needs.
