Abstract    :
              9415868  Buchler    This three-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative 
              research in stellar astronomy between J. Robert Buchler of  the University of
              Florida and Marie-Jo Goupil of the Paris  Observatory in Meudon, France.  They
              propose to analyze  ground and space based observational data on variable 
              (pulsating) stars. They will develop, adapt and test novel,  nonlinear
              techniques in order to constrain modeling of  certain types of pulsating stars.
               This study involves two  disciplines: stellar astrophysics and nonlinear
              dynamics and  signal processing.  Nonlinear signal processing now makes it 
              possible to examine older observational data on pulsating  stars and to extract
              inaccessible information.    The U.S. investigator is a theorist in stellar
              variability  and irregular variations of stars.  His expertise is  complemented
              by French observational experience of pulsating  stars.  The project takes
              advantage of access to French  observational data that will be essential to
              validate the  U.S. investigator's theoretical research effort.  The  results
              will advance understanding of stellar structure and  evolution and the chemical
              composition and evolution of  galaxies.    ***
