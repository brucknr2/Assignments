Abstract    :
              9415353  Mayne  The objective of this US/Taiwan Workshop is to nurture 
              cooperation in geotechnical issues between the engineering  /research
              communities in both countries.. Focus will be on  three themes of mutual
              interest associated with  infrastructure development. The selected themes
              include  Tunneling, Deep Foundations, and Ground Modification. State  of the
              art methods of topics that contribute to the main  themes' advancement will be
              emphasized, such as in situ  testing, risk assessment, physical, analytical and
               computational modeling and advanced technologies. This  proposal is a
              collaborative effort between University of  Massachusetts-Lowell and Georgia
              Institute of Technology. It  is expected that the Workshop will lead to
              involvement of  industry, government agencies and universities in :1. 
              technology transfer, 2. cooperation of infrastructure  development, 3. research
              projects associated with respective  research agencies of both countries.  ***
