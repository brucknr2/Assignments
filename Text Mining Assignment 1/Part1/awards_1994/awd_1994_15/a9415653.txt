Abstract    :
              Popper  9415653    As our theoretical understanding of the structure and
              evolution of  stars advances, greater and greater demands are made on the 
              reliability and accuracy of the fundamental properties of stars --  their
              masses, radii, and temperatures.  This proposal will advance  our empirical
              knowledge of these properties into the relatively  unexplored realm (because of
              strong selection effects) of stars  less massive than the Sun down to about 0.6
              solar masses.  The only  source of information on fundamental properties of
              normal stars  accurate enough to test modern theories of stellar structure and 
              evolution is detached eclipsing binaries.      Several factors provide the
              wherewithal to overcome the  difficulties posed by the selection effects, which
              result from the  low luminosities and small sizes of the less massive stars. 
              First  is the availability of the Hamilton eschelle-CCD spectrometer at  the
              Lick Observatory, which is unsurpassed for the effective  observation of
              spectra of double-lined eclipsing binaries down to  about the 12th magnitude. 
              Second is the availability of efficient  computer programs (IRAF programs in
              this case) for obtaining  reliable radial velocities of both components in the
              spectrum.   Even though the lines in the crowded spectra are washed out   by
              axial rotation and badly blended, cross-correlation of the  binary star
              spectrum with one from a star of known velocity does  the trick.  Third is the
              availability of computing equipment (now  routine) for rapid application of the
              programs.      The resulting masses in the new realm, obtained from analysis of
               the binary star orbits, will be essential in a wide variety of  problems in
              stellar astronomy.   ***
