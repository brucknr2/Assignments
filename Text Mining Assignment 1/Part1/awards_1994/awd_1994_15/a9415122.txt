Abstract    :
              9415122  Macklis  Nottenbohm  Kirn    Many brain disorders, result from the
              death of brain cells.  We do not know how to replace these cells, or even if
              this  is possible.  However, death and replacement of brain cells  (neurons)
              occurs spontaneously in the brain of adult birds.  The new neurons are born in
              the walls of the lateral  ventricle of the brain.  Some of these cells are part
              of the  vocal control system, and are known to be involved in  controlling the
              learning and remembering of song.  Since  this constant replacement is not
              preceded or accompanied by  overt pathology, it can be thought of as a form of
              brain  rejuvenation.  In collaborative research proposed here by  Drs.
              Nottenbohm, Macklis and Kirn, a new technique for  inducing selective cell
              death in the brain will be used and  resulting effects on the generation and
              function of new  brain cells will be tested.  The questions that will be 
              answered are:  1) Is cell replacement restricted to a few  kinds of cells, or
              will any type of brain cell that dies be  replaced by another one of the same
              kind?  2) Do signals  emitted by dying cells play a role in the birth,
              migration,  and survival of the new cells?  3) Does cell replacement  affect
              memory and the acquisition of new memories?  The  answers to these questions
              will help reveal the cellular  dynamics underlying memory formation, and may
              help in the  development of new approaches to repairing brains and  controlling
              the decrement of function that accompanies  aging.***
