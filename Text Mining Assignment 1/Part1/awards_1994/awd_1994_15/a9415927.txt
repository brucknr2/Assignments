Abstract    :
              9415927  Kangari    This proposal supports the collaboration of Dr. Roozbeh 
              Kangari, Department of Civil Engineering, Georgia Institute  of Technology and
              Mr. Junichiro Maeda of the Advanced  Technology Division of Shimizu
              Corporation. Project funding  will enable Dr. Kangari and one of his graduate
              students to  each spend a total of six months in Japan, resident at the 
              Shimizu Corporation, in order to conduct cooperative  research on the SMART
              project, a totally automated system  for high-rise building construction. The
              researchers will  focus their attention on: productivity improvement of the 
              SMART project, statistical analysis of quality enhancement  by SMART, safety
              improvement of the construction work  environment, and comparison of the SMART
              project with  similar systems in the U. S. It is expected that the 
              collaboration will lead to new findings and recommendations  that could assist
              the industry in the U. S. and Japan.    This proposal brings together research
              scientists from two  countries working in the area of robotics in the 
              construction industry. The U. S. engineer and his graduate  student will have
              the opportunity to become familiar with  research techniques, data, equipment,
              and facilities at the  Shimizu Corporation's Advanced Technology Division while
               contributing to the overall research effort. Therefore,  this proposal
              fulfills the objectives of the Program in its  exchange and transfer of
              scientific knowledge through an  international collaboration.  ***
