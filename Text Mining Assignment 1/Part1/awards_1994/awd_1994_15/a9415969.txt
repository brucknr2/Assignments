Abstract    :
              9415969  Salinas    This U.S.-Mexico award will support Prof. Norberto Salinas 
              of the University of Kansas who is organizing jointly with  Prof. E. Ramirez de
              Arellano of the Universidad Nacional  Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM), a research
              workshop on operator  theory and complex and hypercomplex analysis.    The
              purpose of this workshop is to bring together experts  from operator theory as
              well as experts from complex and  hyper-complex analysis to discuss work
              combining ideas from  the theory of Lie groups, non-commutative harmonic
              analysis,  simplectic geometry, the theory of pseudodifferential  operators,
              and partial differential operators with  applications to complex analysis.  The
              meeting will provide  a unique opportunity to promote research collaboration
              and  interaction among the participants.  ***
