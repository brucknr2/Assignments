Abstract    :
              9415479  Morejohn    This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research.  The 
              project is a fishing expedition for microtubule-associated  proteins (MAPs) in
              plants, using a high-risk, innovative  approach based on the production of
              anti-idiotypic  antibodies as reagents for identifying putative MAPs.  %%%  In
              animal systems, a lot is known about microtubule-  associated proteins (MAPs),
              in terms of both protein  structure and functions.  These MAPs play critical
              roles in  stabilizing microtubules and regulating the assembly and  disassembly
              of microtubules.  In plants, a generally  accepted identification of any MAP
              has not yet been  achieved.  Since microtubules play critical roles in the 
              fundamental life processes of plant cells, and since they  are the targets of
              action of an important class of  herbicides, there is compelling reason to
              increase our  understanding of microtubule structure and function in  plants,
              including the identification of MAPs.  This project  is a high-risk but
              plausible approach to the identification  of plant MAPs.  ***
