Abstract    :
              9415644  Clarke    This project consists of an analysis of hydrographic data and
              winds  to study the long-term variability and dynamics of eastern boundary 
              oceanic regions using a linear model.  The study focuses on three  major
              components:  (1)  an estimation of dynamic height along the  eastern boundary
              of the Atlantic back to the early part of this  century and relate the
              resulting variability to heating/global  warming and changes in the strength of
              the equatorial and coastal  winds; (2) use the linear model to analyze the
              coastal ENSO flow;  and, (3) using the same linear model, develop an
              understanding of  the intraseasonal flows when bottom friction and slope bottom
               topography are taken into account.    ***
