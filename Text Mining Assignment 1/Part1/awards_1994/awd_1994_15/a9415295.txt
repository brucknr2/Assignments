Abstract    :
              9415295  Meagher  Heavy metal contamination has reached toxic levels in many
              parts of the world and has become an urgent problem.  It would be useful to be
              able to manipulate single gene traits in plants, which could process heavy
              metals and remediate heavy metal pollution by resistance, sequestration and
              perhaps even assist in the removal of these contaminants from the environment. 
              The product of the bacterial merA gene, mercuric ion reductase (MerA) can
              detoxify ionic mercury by reducing it to its less toxic metallic form, Hgo.   A
              highly mutagenized merA gene confers significant levels of resistance to Hg++
              in transgenic higher plants.  It is hypothesized that MerA can be mutated to
              direct the efficient reduction of a wide variety of metal ions for harvest or
              remediation.  The specific aims of this research are #1: to explore the present
              substrate range of MerA; #2: to develop genetic selections or powerful screens
              for the reduction of gold Au+++, silver (Ag+), lead (Pb++), and cadmium (Cd++)
              in bacteria; #3: to generate merA mutants with novel substrate specificities
              (e.g. enhanced reduction of Au+++ and novel reduction of Pb++ and Cd++; and #4:
              to develop a powerful new RE-PCR (recombination polymerase chain reaction)
              mutagenesis protocol in which tens of thousands of mutant clones are the only
              survivors.  The method takes advantage of the incredible natural
              transformability and high frequency of homologous recombination with in certain
              strains of the soil bacterium, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus.  %%%  Once
              developed, this powerful approach will benefit many areas of biological
              research and development, but in particular, it should accelerate progress in
              bioremediation.  ***
