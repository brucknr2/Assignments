Abstract    :
              9415583  Eberly       A joint, interdisciplinary Center for Theoretical, 
              Mathematical and Computational Research in Optical Science and  Engineering
              will be established at the University of Rochester.  The Center will operate
              within five departments, institutes and  laboratories of the University and is
              intended to provide  advanced training in theoretical research in the broad
              field of  optics, including both science and technology.  The Center will  have
              a visitor program, comprised mostly of trainees/fellows,  provide graduate
              student education in optical science and  engineering and a research and
              development program which will  change as the frontiers of interest in the
              field change.  Finally, a number of industrial and government organizations
              have  agreed to participate as partners in the program.  ***
