Abstract    :
              9415485  Adams    Dr. Adams will continue laboratory studies of the products of
              the dissociative  recombination of terminating interstellar ions that are
              implicated in molecular  synthesis in interstellar clouds.  Vibrational state
              populations of the  molecules will be determined whenever possible.  The
              combined data on the  products will be used in limited models of molecular
              synthesis in interstellar  clouds to predict abundances of species for which
              interstellar detections are  available.
