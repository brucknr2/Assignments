Abstract    :
              9415979  Merrifield  During  the  TOGA  COARE experiment,  an  extensive  set 
              of  observations concentrated in the Intensive Flux Array  (IFA)  documented 
              the  unexpected occurrence  of  large  amplitude  internal wave trains
              propagating towards the northwest  with  a  seemingly permanent form.  These
              distinctive features are  associated  with near-surface current speeds of 
              about  1m/s  and   downward   displacements   in   the   thermocline   of 
              approximately 50 meters.  Much like solitary waves  observed  in other
              locations, these events are closely linked with the  semidiurnal tide; this
              suggests that barotropic  tidal  flow  over  island  ridge  topography  in  the
               vicinity  of   the  observation  site may contribute to their generation.  
              This  project  seeks  to  (1)  examine the effects  of  background  conditions,
                particularly   the   strong   vertical   shear  associated with the
              large-scale equatorial current  systems,  on  the solitary wave groups; (2)
              compare finite-depth  wave  theory  with the observed wave structure,
              propagation speed,  and attenuation; and, (3) investigate the processes that
              may  lead to wave generation.
