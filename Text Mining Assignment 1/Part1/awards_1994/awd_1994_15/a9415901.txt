Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic  Chemistry Program
              supports research by Dr. Marcetta Y.  Darensbourg of the Department of
              Chemistry, Texas A&M University,  on hetrolytic bond activation by first row
              transition metals.   Three projects will be pursued: (1) ligand engineering to 
              activate C-H heterolytic bond cleavage by proximate first row  transition
              metals; (2) mechanism of nickel-thiolate activation of  sulfur dioxide to
              sulfate; (3) homolytic C-S bond cleavage in  low-valent nickel complexes in
              which Ni-H acidity is controlled  by ligand structure.  In the first study,
              rigid chelating and  tetreadentate ligands will stabilize the metals (Co, Fe,
              or Ni)  and enable a C-H bond to be positioned close to the metal center  to
              promote its activation.  In the second investigation, nickel  complexes will be
              used to promote reaction of sulfur dioxide with  dioxygen in an unusual
              reaction in which sulfur dioxide is  converted directly to anionic sulfate
              without formation of a  metal-bound sulfate.  In the third project, activation
              of carbon  dioxide will also be studied, and the acidity of Ni-H in highly 
              reduced species will be determined.    Bond breakage under controlled
              conditions is critical in many  essential chemical reactions.  In all the
              reactions studied with  the support of this award, the position of the metal
              with respect  to bonds to be broken will be controlled to order to investiate 
              how to use metals to position other atoms for reaction.   Answering this
              question is important for understanding many  biological enzyme reactions and
              for developing new industrial  catalysts.  In addition, finding economic means
              to oxidize sulfur  dioxide is vital for pollution abatement, thus adding to the
               significance of understanding the details of reaction of sulfur  dioxide and
              oxygen.
