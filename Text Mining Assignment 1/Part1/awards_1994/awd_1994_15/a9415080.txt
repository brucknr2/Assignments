Abstract    :
              Eastern Michigan University is the recipient of ARI funds for the renovation  of
              research and research training laboratories, located in the Mark Jefferson 
              Building, home of the Department of Chemistry.  Research activities are 
              currently conducted in a building designed in 1966.  The department's 
              allocation of space has evolved in a series of ad hoc adjustments leading to 
              less than optimum conditions.  With support from the NSF, the department  will
              reorganize its research, training, and research support facilities to permit 
              more efficient, flexible and productive use of their resources.  Renovations 
              consist of:  outfitting three synthesis laboratories with additional fume
              hoods,  and upgrading the ventilation system; customizing the biochemical 
              toxicology laboratory by replacing fume hoods with a laminar flow hood and 
              incubators, and modernizing instrument and chemical storage rooms.  This 
              project will have the following results:  increasing research productivity,  
              accommodating more students involved in research training, improving the 
              health and safety  conditions of  laboratories for all research personnel, and 
              providing a system for flexible utilization of the department's resources that 
              will enable the facility to serve for future needs.  More opportunities for 
              research training will augment Eastern Michigan's success in providing 
              undergraduates with solid research experiences, leading students to pursue 
              careers in science.
