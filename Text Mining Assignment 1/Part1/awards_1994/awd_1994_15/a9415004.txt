Abstract    :
              9415004  Keyvan  According to the NRC Regulatory Guide 1.133, any reactor
              licensed  since 1978 must have systems to detect loose parts and components 
              with reactor vessels and primary coolant systems.  Early  detection of loose
              parts in light water reactors is important  from both safety and economic point
              of view.  Early detection of  loose parts can prevent extended outages, reduce
              downtime for  repair of damage caused by undetected parts, and could provide an
               indication of degradation of reactor internals.    The result of this research
              will provide a methodology to better  utilize acoustic signature for diagnostic
              purposes.  In case of  nuclear plants, this will have significant positive
              impact on  safety, economic, and plant life extension for aging plants.  The 
              result of this research will have two major positive impacts:    1) Effective
              acoustic signature analysis for general diagnostic  monitoring purpose, 2)
              Advancement of the loose part monitoring  process, which will in turn minimize
              operator error.  ***
