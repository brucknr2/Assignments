Abstract    :
              9415342  Smith  The research proposed in this application is concerned with  an
              improved 2-D ultrasonic transducer by using opto-  electronic transmitter
              technology to replace power  amplifiers and coaxial cables.  Low power diode
              lasers,  optical fibers and photo conductive switches will be used in  the new
              system.    The research has the potential to eliminate the bulky  transducer
              cables now used in high density ultrasonic  arrays, and thus allow the system
              to be more flexible and to  consist of more transmit channels.  ***
