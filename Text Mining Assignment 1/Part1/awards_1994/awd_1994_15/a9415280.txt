Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  KOSALY  CTS-9415280      The proposed program is a continuation of the
              PI's current investigations of chemically reacting turbulent flows using direct
              numerical simulation (DNS).  The PIs propose to extend their present effort in
              order to investigate the effects of differential diffusion and heat release on
              the small scale structure of turbulent mixing and chemical reactions in
              turbulence.  Specifically the investigation will include the application of DNS
              to the following turbulent, non-premixed reacting flows:     (1)  DNS of
              homogeneous, decaying turbulence with chemical reaction and differential
              diffusion.  No heat release effects considered.     (2)  DNS of spatially
              evolving, approximately homogeneous turbulence with chemical reaction.  Heat
              release effects will be included.  The applicability of the conditional closure
              model (CMC) near extinction will be examined as will the radical prediction
              capability of the CMC model.     (3)  DNS of a spatially-evolving, turbulent
              jet with chemical reaction.  Heat release and a one step chemical reaction will
              be considered as will the important assumption of the independence of the
              conditional moments on the transverse coordinate in the CMC model.
