Abstract    :
                This three-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative research in
              information systems between Algirdas Avizienis of the University of California,
              Los Angeles, and Jean-Claude Laprie of the Laboratory for the Automation and
              Analysis of Systems in Toulouse, France.  The objective of their research is to
              specify, design, implement and evaluate experimentally a distributed
              fault-tolerant system that incorporates tolerance of all classes of faults. 
              Fault tolerance is the attribute of information processing systems which makes
              in possible for the system to continue delivering its services correctly
              regardless of faults that cause errors in information processing.   The
              investigators will study computer fault tolerance with respect to security and
              privacy violations, unauthorized access, execution of non-specified services,
              and loss of important services.   The U.S. investigator brings to this
              collaboration considerable expertise in fault-tolerant computing. His group
              will focus on the tolerance of malicious logic in a system. This is
              complemented by similar French expertise and the availability of a large
              network of workstations in France devoted to this effort.  They will address
              the tolerance of intrusion into a system.  The project will advance fundamental
              understanding in fault tolerance and security and could lead to improved,
              secure systems.  These systems are needed and important for the rapidly
              expanding multimedia and telecommunications markets.
