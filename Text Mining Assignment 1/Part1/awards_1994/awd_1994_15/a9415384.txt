Abstract    :
              This project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, is 
              directed towards identifying those factors which limit the sensitivity and
              accuracy  of atmospheric pressure plasma based mass spectrometry. During the
              tenure of this  three-year standard grant, Professor Paul Farnsworth and his
              students at Brigham  Young University will investigate the processes under
              which an ion beam is  extracted from an inductively coupled plasma source, and
              directed into a mass  spectrometer for analysis.  Two techniques will be used
              to characterize this  process. The first involves placing a nickel mesh in the
              path of the ion beam for  a fixed time period prior to removal for analysis by
              scanning electron microscopy.  The second approach is based on laser induced
              fluorescence of selected ionic  species within the ion plume. These studies
              will allow a much more accurate  picture of the ion beam extraction process,
              and should permit the design  of highly  efficient inductively coupled plasma
              mass spectrometers.     Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry is rapidly
              becoming the method of  choice for low level determinations of elemental
              composition for a wide range of  samples in areas ranging from the environment
              to biotechnology. At present, the efficiency of  ion transport in these devices
              is the limiting factor in their performance. Paul Farnsworth and  his students
              at Brigham Young University are characterizing the ion extraction processes. 
              The  results from these studies could allow a new generation of spectrometers
              with improved accuracy  and higher sensitivities to be designed.
