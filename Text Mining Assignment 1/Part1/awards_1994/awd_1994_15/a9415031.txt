Abstract    :
                The Texas Engineering Experiment Station is the recipient of funds from the
              Academic Research Infrastructure Program for the rehabilitation of the Ocean
              and Coastal Engineering Laboratory at Texas A&M University.  Constructed in
              1935, the laboratory has provided opportunities for research and research
              training in the areas of environmental transport, ocean and coastal
              engineering, fluid structure interaction, and fluid dynamics.  The entire
              facility includes: a dredge pump and pipeloop test facility, deep glass wall
              wave tanks, a titling flume, and a deep wave basin.  The dredging capability of
              the laboratory is unique in the United States and is the only one in the world
              owned and operated by a university.  The existing facility is rapidly
              deteriorating, and the fixed equipment, constructed in the late 1960s, has
              outgrown the research needs of the department.  With research volume steadily 
              increasing in the Ocean Engineering Program, from other areas in Civil
              Engineering such as Environmental, Water Resources, Geotechnical and
              Structures, Oceanography, and Chemical Engineering, the laboratory can no
              longer support research activities of faculty and students.  ARI funds will be
              used replace and relocate space and fixed equipment dedicated to ocean and
              coastal engineering adjacent to the NSF funded Offshore Technology Research
              Center.  Currently, the facilities are several miles apart and it is difficult
              for faculty to collaborate and coordinate research efforts.  This project will
              promote synergy and insure that all  of ocean and engineering research,
              faculty, equipment,  and shop facilities are located in a centralized area on
              campus.  Beneficiaries will include 10 full time faculty, 50 graduate students,
              120 undergraduates, and faculty members in related departments.
