Abstract    :
                        9415072  Keer  This research is to understand the failure mechanisms
              in diamond-  like carbon coatings from the dislocation and fracture mechanics 
              points of view and from morphological investigations and contact  fatigue
              tests.  This research will provide further insight into the  causes of the
              failure of coatings in general and will assist in the  determination of optimum
              coating thickness.  This information will  help improve the fatigue life of
              gear and bearing components.  ***
