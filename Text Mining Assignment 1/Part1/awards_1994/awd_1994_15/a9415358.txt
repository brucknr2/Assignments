Abstract    :
              9415358   Hummel      The proposed research is aimed towards increasing the
              level of  sophistication in our understanding of the electronic structure and 
              of the materials and processing variables that influence  photoluminescence in
              nanocrystalline ("porous") silicon. We will  develop, investigate, and
              characterize nanocrystalline silicon  which has been produced by spark
              processing, a technique that is  markedly different from commonly employed
              preparation methods  (i.e., anodic etching). We intend to develop further
              understanding  of the mechanisms responsible for the photoluminescence of spark
               processed nanocrystalline silicon and to possibly produce an  efficient light
              emitting test structure.   %%%   The proposed research has high likelihood for
              leading to new  scientific discoveries and insights into basic mechanisms of
              light  emitting silicon. Research of this type on "porous" silicon may 
              eventually lead to efficient silicon-based light emitting diodes,  advanced
              display systems, optical memories, or possibly lasers.    An important feature
              of the program is the training of graduate and  undergraduate students in a
              fundamentally and technologically  significant area of materials and processing
              research.  This  research will contribute to improving the general performance
              of  advanced devices and integrated circuits used in computing,  information
              processing, and telecommunications.    ***
