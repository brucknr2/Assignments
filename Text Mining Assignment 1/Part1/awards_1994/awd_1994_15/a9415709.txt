Abstract    :
              9415709    Swinney    This Americas Program award will  fund a  collaborative 
              research project between dr. Harry Swinney, University of  Texas, Austin, and
              Dr. Francisco Melo, Universidad  de  Santiago de Chile, on  the physics of
              granular flow.   The  researchers will conduct experiments on the formation of
              two-  dimensional spatial patterns in vertically oscillated  granular
              materials.  The formation and evolution of the  patterns will be studied using
              digital imaging techniques  and analyses  will examine the effects of energy 
              dissipation, air pressure, particle size, and forcing on the  collective motion
              .   The goal of the research is to develop  new insights towards a full
              understanding of the underlying  mechanism in the formation of the spatial
              patterns in these  granular materials.    Granular materials play an important
              role in industries such  as mining , agriculture, and construction, yet an 
              understanding of the fundamental processes governing the  collective behavior
              of  these materials is lacking.  The  proposed  collaborative research should
              make a fundamental  contribution to the understanding of the physics of
              granular  flow, and should help in understanding the role of  parameters that
              are varied in industrial processes involving  the granular flow.,  ***
