Abstract    :
              9415559  Keene     The chemistry of inorganic chlorine and its influence on
              oxidation processes in the marine boundary layer (MBL) are very uncertain. 
              Indirect evidence suggests that C1 atoms may be important oxidants over the
              world's oceans.  In addition, recent field measurements reveal significant
              concentrations of inorganic C1 gases other than HC1 (probably HOC1 and/or C12)
              in the MBL.  C1 atom precursors are thought to originate from reactions
              involving sea-salt aerosol (or possibly sea ice in polar regions), but
              mechanisms of sea-salt dechlorination are poorly understood.     This study
              will assess the influence of inorganic chlorine chemistry on the cycling of
              ozone, non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs), sulfur, and nitrogen in the MBL. 
              Specific research objectives include:  1) To measure simultaneously principal
              reactant and product species and related physical properties involved in MBL
              chlorine chemistry; 2) To test hypothesized mechanisms that dechlorinate
              sea-salt aerosol; 3)  To assess the relative importance of C1 atoms and OH
              radicals as oxidants in the MBL; 4) To search for unique product compounds
              generated by C1 atom reactions; and 5) To model inorganic C1 chemistry and its
              contribution to oxidizing capacity in the MBL.     Air will be intensively
              sampled during approximately 10 diel cycles over a 4-week period at the
              Atmosphere/Ocean Chemistry Experiment (AEROCE) sampling station on Bermuda. 
              Reactive trace gases (HC1*, C12*, HOC1*, NMHCs, organic halides, SO2, NHO3, NO,
              NOx, NOy, O3, and CO), the chemical composition (major ions and trace elements)
              of size-segregated aerosol, a variety of tracers, and troposphere meteorology
              will be measured.
