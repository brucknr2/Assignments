Abstract    :
                  9415105  Ioannou  This research presents the modeling language and overall
              structure  for an object-oriented simulation system for construction with a 
              dynamic decision-making inference engine.  At the center of the  system is a
              new programming language for simulation modeling.  This  language will be able
              to directly model uncertainty in any process  variable and not just time (e.g.,
              material quantities required,  resources produced, distance traveled, equipment
              productivity,  cost, etc.) It will eliminate the need for data pre-processing
              and  the post-processing of simulation results before management  decision can
              be made.  It will allow conditional (derived)  distributions for the duration
              of activities based on the current  state of the system and the availability
              and type of resources  (resource-driven simulation).  It will also allow
              modeling bulk and  characterizable resources with resource tracking.  Resource 
              consumption and generation as well as the routing of resources  (resource flow)
              will be able to be modeled as stochastic processes.   In order to model
              real-life decision making, resource flow will  also be able to be modeled
              dynamically based on the qtate of the  system by using a user-defined
              value-system.
