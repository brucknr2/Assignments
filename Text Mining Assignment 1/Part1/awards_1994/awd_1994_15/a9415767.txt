Abstract    :
              This award will support the deployment of a resonance lidar at the  Poker Flat
              Research Range near Fairbanks, Alaska.  The lidar will  provide measurements of
              the arctic middle atmosphere from the upper  troposphere to the lower
              thermosphere.  The lidar employs  scattering from molecules, aerosols, and
              metal atoms to yield  measurements of density, temperature, aerosol backscatter
              ratio,  and metal density in the stratosphere and mesosphere.  The 
              measurements will be used to address several topics of current  research
              interest:  the role of aerosols in the chemistry of the  high latitude
              stratosphere, the occurrence of aerosols in the polar  mesosphere, the
              temperature structure of the lower mesosphere and  stratosphere, the structure
              of the mesospheric metal layers, and  the characteristics of waves and tides in
              the mesopause region.   The lidar measurements will be complemented by a
              variety of studies  of the atmosphere and the aurora being conducted at the
              Poker Flat  Research Range.
