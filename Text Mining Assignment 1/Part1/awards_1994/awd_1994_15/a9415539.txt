Abstract    :
              9415539  Detrick       This funding is for the 4th RIDGE Theoretical Institute 
              titled "Mechanisms of faulting and magma emplacement at mid-ocean  ridges." 
              This institute will be organized by Roger Buck, Paul  Delaney, and Jeff Karson
              and will focus on how brittle  lithosphere deforms at a spreading center due
              both to faulting  the intrusion of magma.  The Short course and workshop will
              bring  together land geologists and theorests who have worked on  problems of
              faulting and magmatism in volcanic rifts with  scientists who study the
              structure and morphology of mid-ocean  ridges.  ***
