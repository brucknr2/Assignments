Abstract    :
              9415437  Sorooshian    The classical approach to model calibration has been
              taken as far  as it can go.  Currently available calibration strategies are 
              poorly suited to the task of calibrating conceptual hydrologic  models in
              general and are woefully inadequate in the face of the  emerging generation of
              distributed parameter hydrologic models.  An  entirely new conceptual paradigm
              is necessary for further progress  to be made.  The work will explore the use
              of multi-objective   procedures for the objective identification of the
              non-dominated  model set, and graphical visualization techniques to facilitate
              the  subjective procedure inherent in choosing a reduced model set.  The 
              exploratory research will lead to the preparation and submission to  NSF,
              within 9 months of a full scale proposal addressing the  problem of calibrating
              semi-distributed and distributed hydrologic  models within the framework of the
              new paradigm.
