Abstract    :
              9415683  Guzman  This project is on research to study the synthesis and 
              development of water soluble bifunctional affinity ligands.   These ligands are
              potentially useful for a variety of biochemical  separations, as well as
              analytical, preparative and diagnostic  applications.  Soluble polymers such as
              polyethylene glycol (PEG)  will be derivatized with two different reactive
              groups at two  termini to obtain heterofunctional complexes with two different 
              affinity groups.  A variety of functional ligands, such as  chelating agents,
              peptides, proteins, enzyme-substrates etc.,  will be synthesized and studied. 
              Also, the recovery and reuse of  these ligands will be investigated.  ***
