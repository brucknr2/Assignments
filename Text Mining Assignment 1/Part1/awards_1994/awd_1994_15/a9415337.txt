Abstract    :
              In this project funded by the Advanced Materials Processing Program of the
              Chemistry Division and the Electronic Materials Program of the Division of
              Materials Research, Xiaoyang Zhu of Southern Illinois University will study the
              fundamental reaction dynamics underlying thermal- and laser-assisted/induced
              atomic-layer epitaxial (ALE) growth of III-V semiconductors, predominantly
              gallium arsenide (GaAs).  Quantum-state resolved distributions of nascent
              gas-phase products (methyl radicals and molecular hydrogen) formed in situ
              during laser-ALE growth of GaAs.  Experimental techniques include
              resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) spectroscopy and
              time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (TOFMS).  The energetic information carried by
              gas-phase species should help answer such important questions as the molecular
              basis for the macroscopic kinetics observed in ALE, the effect on growth
              kinetics of the evolving surface structure, the coupling and redistribution of
              photon energy, and other ALE pathways involving Ga- and As-containing gas-phase
              products.  The proposed research will also be extended to ALE growth of other
              III-V compounds.  %%%  Gallium arsenide (GaAs) based semiconductors play a
              vital role in the development of the next generation of optoelectronic and
              digital instruments because of some of their attractive properties, such as
              high speed, (for example, for computational purposes) and desirable active
              wavelength (in the case of communications devices).  However, the manufacture
              of GaAs-based semiconductors has been hindered in part by effective methods for
              forming the electronic devices.  This project addresses some of the stumbling
              blocks in one of the most promising methods of depositing GaAs in order to find
              resolve some of the problems.
