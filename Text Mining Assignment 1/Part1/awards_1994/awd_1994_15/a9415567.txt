Abstract    :
              The overall goal of this program is to explore the chemical  and traditional
              synthesis, processing and microwave  dielectric properties of novel ceramics in
              the system  tantalum oxide-zirconium dioxide.  The investigation will be 
              conducted to gain deeper insights into the fundamental  relationships between
              the atomic level defects,  heterogeneous interfaces and dielectric properties. 
              The  measurement results of quality factor, dielectric constant  and
              temperature coefficients of these properties will be  correlated to the
              observed microstructure and the far  infrared reflectance spectra.  The program
              will establish  the collaboration with engineers and scientists from 
              industries and National Institute of Standards and  Technology (NIST).    The
              proposed work will explore the fundamental understanding  and relationship
              between the atomic level defects,  heterogeneous interfaces and microwave
              dielectric properties  and its temperature dependence.  The program will
              establish  the collaboration with industries and government  laboratories
              (NIST).
