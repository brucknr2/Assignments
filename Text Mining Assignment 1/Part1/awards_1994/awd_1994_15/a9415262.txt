Abstract    :
              9415262   Su       This award supports a 12-month Japan Society for the  
              Promotion of Science Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. Sophia   Su at the
              University of Kyoto, Japan.  Dr. Su will work with   Dr. Mitsuhiro Yanagida,
              Department of Biophysics, on a   research project entitled, "Japan JSPS
              Program:    Identification and Characterization of Genes Required for   the
              GO/G1 Transition in Fission Yeast Schizosaccharomyces   pombe."       Fission
              yeast is a unicellular eukaryotic cell which is an   excellent model to study
              cell division cycle control and   mitosis.  Dr. Su and Dr. Yanagida will use
              the S. pombe as a   model system to study the growth and differentiation of  
              cells after they have been subjected to a nutrient or serum-  starved
              conditions. The team will identify genes that are   expressed and operated
              during the transition from   nonproliferative (G0) to proliferative (G1) cell
              states.    The team will isolate the regulatory gene products that may   be
              necessary for leaving the G0 state and promoting initial   DNA synthesis and
              cytoskeletal changes of the G1 state.    These gene products may reveal
              universal roles in regulating   cellular growth and cellular differentiation
              for yeast, may   be similar to the regulation of cell proliferation of  
              mammals and might have important implications for using   yeast as a model for
              cancer research.    ***
