Abstract    :
               Us companies file R&D data with the Census Bureau on Form RD-1, and the data
              are used to create industry aggregates published annually by NSF.  Many of
              those companies also file R&D data with the SEC, on form 10-K.  The purpose of
              this project is to investigate the differences between these two sets of data. 
              We expect the results of this project to lead to improvements in the quality of
              reported R&D data.     R&D-1 is the only source of R&D data for 2600-2800
              companies, those that do not report to the SEC.  It is also the only source for
              the breakdown between basic and applied research, and between company funded
              and government funded industry performed R&D.  The definition of R&D on the
              RD-1 survey is restricted to the hard sciences and engineering, so the survey
              is unique in that sense.  It is the main source of industrial sector R&D data
              for US government policy makers, and is also the source for the multi-country
              R&D presentations of the OECD.  Whether the unique features of RD-1 are worth
              preserving, and in what forms, and whether there should be changes in the
              survey, are data quality questions that are clearly important for both public
              and private science and technology policy determination.  The SEC 10K R&D data
              results are reported by name of firm and are very up to date, these are
              advantages over the current RD-1.     The project has two parts: a detailed
              investigation into the differences at the company level, and a set of field
              interviews with firms in order to discover the sources of unexplained
              differences in the two R&D reports.       The final technical report, executive
              summary, and abstract should provides a stronger basis for deciding on future
              industry R&D data collection strategies and more effective government and
              private use of the resulting data.
