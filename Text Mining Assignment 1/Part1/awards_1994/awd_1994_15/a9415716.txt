Abstract    :
              9415716  Buffler       The objective of the study is to image the offshore part
              of  the Chicxulub K/T boundary impact crater, off Yucatan in the Gulf  of
              Mexico.  Deep penetration seismic reflection, wide-angle  seismic and
              refraction measurements are planned.  This is a joint  project with the British
              BIRPS program in the same area.  The PIs  will deploy an array of OBSs in two
              key areas.  The data will  help determine the thickness and lateral extent of
              the melt sheet  and basement uplift associated with the impact.  ***
