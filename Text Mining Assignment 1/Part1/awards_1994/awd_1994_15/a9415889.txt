Abstract    :
              9415889  Holbrow  This project will solicit, prepare, and publish a new category
              of  physics problems for intermediate-level undergraduate physics  courses. 
              These problems are to be derived from current or recent  work of physicists and
              engineers actively engaged in research.  The purpose of these problems is to
              exhibit new, interesting, or  particularly insightful applications of
              undergraduate physics to  the phenomena or results of contemporary physics
              research.  The  problems are being published in the American Journal of Physics
               in a special section called "New Problems", and will be made  available via
              Internet.  ***
