Abstract    :
              9415418  Kawatra    Description:  This project supports  collaboration between
              Dr. S.K. Kawatra of the  Michigan Technological University and Dr. T.C.  Rao of
              the Regional Research Laboratory in  Bhopal, India.  The research aims at 
              understanding the behavior of entrained  particles.  Entrainment is one of the
              important  mechanisms in processing of coal by froth  flotation where particles
              are transported from  the pulp phase to the froth phase.  In that  process
              particles enter the base of a flotation  froth and are transferred up and out
              of the  flotation cell suspended in water between the  bubbles.  The process is
              subject to the  influence of many factors, such as the particle  size, shape
              and surface chemistry, whose  effects are not fully understood.  In this 
              research, experiments will be carried out to  conduct studies in batch and
              continuous  flotation cells.  Experiments will be conducted  using both
              well-characterized coals and  synthetic mixtures of purified components, to 
              compensate for the difficulty of determining  particle characteristics in the
              heterogeneous  mixture of minerals in coal.    Scope :  This project involves
              collaboration by  two scientists with complementary experiences  in testing and
              in mathematical modeling in  dealing with a fundamental science problem.   The
              solution of this problem, leading to better  understanding of the factors
              involved in the  process of particle entrainment, could have  applications in
              the future in various  industries.    ***
