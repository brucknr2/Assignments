Abstract    :
                This three-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative research in
              biochemical genetics among several American and French researchers at the
              University of Colorado and the Laboratory for Molecular Genetics, French
              National Center for Scientific Research, in Strasbourg, France.  The
              investigators are Arthur Gutierrez-Hartmann, Andrew Bradford and Bohdan
              Wasylyk.  The objectives of their research are to define regions of the
              molecules Ets-1 protoocogene and GHF-1/Pit-1 and their role in cellular
              differentiation and malignant transformation.  They will perform site-directed
              mutagenesis experiments in order to define regions of the two proteins that are
              involved in mediating their interaction.  The U.S. investigators bring to this
              collaboration their expertise in hormonal regulation of gene expression. This
              is complemented by the French investigator's expertise in the Ets molecules and
              takes advantage of  French techniques in generating on site Ets mutants.  The
              results will advance our understanding of molecular mechanisms  common to all
              cell types, healthy and malignant, and cell-specific responses.
