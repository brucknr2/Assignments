This is a collaborative study of deep and bottom water
              formation in the southern sector of the Indian Ocean, as part of the World
              Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) Indian Ocean Expedition (IOE).  Six PIs
              from six institutions will complete the final segment of the WOCE Hydrographic
              Program Line, S-4, along 60 degrees South from about 20 degrees East to about
              120 degrees East.  The program is designed to detect subtle differences across
              the Kerguelen Plateau, an important hydrographic boundary for bottom waters. 
              In addition to hydrography, the section will include standard tracer
              measurements, as well as CFCs, Helium, Tritium, and Carbon-14, all to WOCE
              standards.  In addition to the zonal line, two excursions to the shelf at about
              50 degrees East and 96 degrees East will be made to investigate the Antarctic
              Slope Front and its associated westward current.  Expendable current moorings
              will also be deployed at several locations to measure, for one year, the
              current along the slope and on the flanks of the Kerguelen Plateau.  In this
              component, the PIs will provide the overall scientific leadership, and the
              current component in direct collaboration with Oregon State University.
