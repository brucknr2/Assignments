Abstract    :
              This award will provide funding for the consolidation and modernization of the
              biological  science research and research training facilities at Penn
              State-Erie, The Behrend College, by  renovating the ground floor of the Nick
              Building, a 25 year old facility.  Faculty and students in  biology concentrate
              on research projects relating to the Lake Erie and western Pennsylvania 
              regions.  This research includes studies of species diversity of small mammals,
              biodiversity of  aquatic insects of Pennsylvania, genetics and byssal
              morphology of indigenous species of Great  Lakes mussels, and the succession of
              wetlands and associated changes of invertebrate diversity.   Renovation of the
              biological research areas is of critical importance given the growth in the 
              number of biology students.   The renovations will include consolidation in the
              Nick Building of research space that is  currently interspersed haphazardly
              with non-research space and spread out in three buildings:  Nick, Science, and
              Hammermill.  The Nick facility has never been renovated and is inadequate  for
              modern biological research and training.  Among the facility's deficiencies
              are:  an outmoded  workplace design, lack of air conditioning, poor lighting,
              and the deteriorating condition of lab  casework.  The renovated space will
              accommodate more students in faculty-mentored  undergraduate research and
              facilitate the College's plan to strengthen and invigorate the biology 
              program.
