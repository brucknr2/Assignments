Abstract    :
              This is a study to investigate the relationship between fine-scale neutral
              atmosphere structure, acoustic gravity  waves, tides and the presence of
              sporadic sodium, iron and ion layers in the middle atmosphere.  The study will 
              make use of data obtained with radars and lidars during several observational
              campaigns over the last fifteen years.   The observations will be compared to
              determine differences in the low and mid-latitude tidal and gravity wave 
              processes and how they relate to layer formation.  A parallel
              theoretical/numerical modeling effort will concentrate  on formation of
              sporadic neutral and ion layers and on the breaking of acoustic gravity waves
              above the mesopause.   The lidar data will be added to a centralized data base
              that will be accessible via the Mosaic networking system.
