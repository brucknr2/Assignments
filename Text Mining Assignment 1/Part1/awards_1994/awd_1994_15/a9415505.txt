Abstract    :
                9415505  Leventhal    This three-year award will support student participation
              in U.S.-  Italy cooperative research in chaos in atomic systems between  Jacob
              Leventhal of the University of Missouri - Saint Louis, and  Professors Maria
              Allegrini and Ennio Arimondo at the University  of Pisa, Italy.   The focus of
              the research will be on examining  the responses of specially prepared atoms,
              Rydberg atoms, to  alternating electric fields from the perspective of modern 
              conceptions of transitions of physical systems from ordered to  chaotic motion.
                 The U.S. side of the collaboration brings expertise in  experimental methods
              focusing on exploitation of the unique  properties of Rydberg atoms in a
              variety of applications.  This  is complemented by the Italian collaborators'
              studies of  transitions to chaotic behavior and their expertise in 
              experimental atomic physics.  They have worked with infrared  lasers, and have
              designed the line selectable carbon dioxide  laser crucial to the method of
              these experiments.  ***
