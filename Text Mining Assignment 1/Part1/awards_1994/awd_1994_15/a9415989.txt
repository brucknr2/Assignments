Abstract    :
              9415989  Sinton       This work is the combined effort of three investigators 
              to analyze rocks collected during a dive program that was  conducted on the
              East Pacific Rise between 17 and 19 degrees  S in December 1993.  The rocks are
              from the ridge axis, from  an abandoned ridge a few kilometers from the active
              ridge  and from nearby seamounts. The purpose in analyzing the  rocks is to
              determine the frequency and chemical variability  on this very fast spreading
              ridge.  They will also review  dive tapes and photographs to estimate the
              volumes of  eruptions.  The techniques to be used are electron  microprobe of
              basalt glass, XRF of whole rocks, and U-Th-Ra  geochronology.  ***
