Abstract    :
              9415911  Halliwell    Presently, the Miami Isopycnic Coordinate Ocean Model
              (MICOM) have  limited capabilities because mixing, which depends strongly on 
              depth dependent physical processes within the mixed layer, must be  governed by
              a simple bulk parameterization of the important terms  of the vertically
              integrated TKE balance; these parameterized terms  contain poorly-known
              coefficients.  This project will solve this  problem because it will cap the
              MICOM with a level coordinate mixed  layer model capable of explicitly
              resolving depth-dependent  physical processes within the mixed layer.  The long
              term goal of  the project is to perform eddy-resolving global simulations on a 
              massively parallel computer.
