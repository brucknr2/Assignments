Abstract    :
              9415604  Kadanoff    The topics for investigation include the study of the 
              separation of drops from a mass of fluid, the development of  techniques for
              measuring and modeling well-developed  turbulence, and the study of flows past
              obstacles.  The  specific applications include data analysis for flow near a 
              boundary, simplified models of energy dissipation in highly  turbulent flow,
              some instabilities of the motion on the  surface of liquids, and the motion of
              shaken sand.  This  theoretical project is co-funded by the Divisions of 
              Materials  Research and Physics.  %%%  This theoretical project involves both
              research and  teaching.  Under research, we study the separation of drops  from
              a mass of fluid, turbulent flow, and the motion of  granular materials.  Under
              teaching, we train graduate  students and postdoctorals to do research on the
              motion of  fluids and also develop new course material, for example,  for an
              undergraduate course on the subject of chaos.  This  project is co-funded by
              the Divisions of Materials Research  and Physics.  ***
