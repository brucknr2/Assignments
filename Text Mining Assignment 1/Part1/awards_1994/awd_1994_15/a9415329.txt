Abstract    :
              9415329  Dever  This is an award to support preliminary work on the
              relationships  between the measured and theoretical filtration properties of 
              melt blown electret and biocide loaded air filters and to collect  data that
              will provide the basis for a more comprehensive study  of this concept.  In
              this project, the investigator plans on  incorporating the electrostatic
              mechanism into the filtration  theory to account for removal by the electrets
              and incorporate  diffusion, interception and inertial impaction mechanisms into
               the filter theory to account for particle bounce at high  velocities.    The
              proposal leading to this award was submitted in response to  NSF 93-130,
              Research Planning Grants for Women.  Results are  expected to provide the basis
              upon which the concept proposed can  be evaluated for its potential use in
              design of air-filters for  removing environmental pollutants from indoor air, a
              matter of  current and growing concern.  ***
