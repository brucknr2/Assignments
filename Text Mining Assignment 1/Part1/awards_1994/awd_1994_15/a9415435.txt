Abstract    :
              9415435  Storm    The objective of the conference is to faster closer
              interactions  among the members of the crystal growth community and to increase
               and help disseminate new knowledge in the constituent field of  scientific
              study that comprises crystal growth.  There will be  100110 participants, 90%
              being United States Scientists, engineers  and students.    %%%    The
              conference on crystal growth will cover recent advances in  theoretical
              modelling of interfacial properties and processes  related to growth from
              vapor, melt, solution and solid state  reaction.  ***
