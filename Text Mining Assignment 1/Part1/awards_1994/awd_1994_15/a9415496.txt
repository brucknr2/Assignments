Abstract    :
                 There is a growing need for effective formal methods of  constructing correct
              and reliable computer programs. This need  becomes  especially crucial in the
              case of concurrent,distributed,  real-time, or, more  generally, reactive
              systems. Such systems  typically involve a number of  delicate and subtle
              aspects such as  parallel operation of distinct, often  geographically
              dispersed  components, and ongoing, ideally nonterminating  computation where 
              each component repeatedly interacts with neighboring  components  in order to
              achieve a global goal or maintain a global invariant.   Many safety critical
              real-world applications programs can be  counted among the  reactive systems.
              Examples include: computer  operating systems, computer  network communication
              protocols, air  traffic control systems, on-board avionics  control systems, as
               well as automated banking networks.    The approach taken  in this research to
              reasoning about such  reactive systems centers around the  use of Temporal
              Logic, a  formalism that can be used for specification,  verification,  design,
              and synthesis of reactive systems. This research  investigates to what extent
              efficient automation of temporal  reasoning about  reactive systems is
              possible. Considerable  attention is devoted to the  following particular
              aspects:  attacking the state explosion problem, reasoning  about many 
              homogenous processes, real-time reasoning, and synthesis of  reactive systems.
