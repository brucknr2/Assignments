Abstract    :
                The University of Missouri at Columbia is the recipient of ARI funds for the
              renovation of chemical research facilities.  The Chemistry Department is housed
              in two buildings, Schlundt Hall and the Chemistry Building, erected in 1924 and
              1972 respectively. As part of a comprehensive effort to improve the scientific
              capabilities of the department, the University will construct new teaching
              laboratories and renovate the Chemistry Building, the NSF project site.  The
              four-story structure includes a combination of research, teaching, and
              laboratory support facilities. NSF funds will be used entirely for the
              restoration of research and research training space within the building.
              Current deficiencies that impede research consist of:  inefficient laboratories
              and support facilities that were not originally design to handle increased
              research activity, inadequate ventilation and fume hood systems, obsolete
              mechanical systems, and the absence of fire protection systems. 
              Reconfiguration of laboratories will provide safer conditions for all research
              faculty and students. Not only will the renovation correct inadequacies and
              address ADA compliance issues, but the project will allow for the consolidation
              of departmental research activities,  and the centralization of instrumentation
              to be shared by all research teams in one location. Research programs impacted
              by the renovation include: supramolecular chemistry, environmental chemistry,
              radiochemistry and ultra fast  laser spectroscopy.  Approximately fourteen
              faculty members, eight post-doctoral fellows, 90 graduate students and 105
              undergraduates will benefit from the modernization.
