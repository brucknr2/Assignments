Abstract    :
              9415827  Hrushovski       Since the early 1980's, the Greater Boston Logic
              Conference  has offered a major opportunity for prominent researchers and 
              graduate students alike to meet on an extended and concentrated  basis.  The
              Greater Boston Logic Conference, to be held at the  Massachusetts Institute of
              Technology on May 27-30, 1995, is a  continuation and expansion of this
              biennial conference series.   Each day of the four-day conference will be
              divided into morning  and afternoon sessions, of which the morning sessions
              will  consist of plenary lectures by the invited speakers, of interest  to a
              general audience of logicians.       Each afternoon session will consist of
              three or more  simultaneous workshops, each workshop emphasizing an advanced 
              topic within Model Theory, Recursion Theory, or Set Theory.   These will
              include workshops on Model Theory and Analytic  Functions, Applied Stability
              Theory, Degree Theory, and Inner  Model Theory and Fine Structure.  The
              workshops' goal is to aid  both established mathematicians and graduate
              students to break  into important, fast developing, and technically difficult
              areas.   Workshop speakers will be encouraged to give complete proofs and  to
              explain the methods and intuition behind them; there will be  considerable time
              devoted to questions and discussion.  The  majority of the funds provided by
              the National Science Foundation  will defray travel expenses for graduate
              students and postdocs.   Funds will also be used for invited speakers without
              other grant  support.  ***
