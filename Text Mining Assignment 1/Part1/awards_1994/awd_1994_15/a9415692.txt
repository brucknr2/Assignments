              abush (Aubrey Bush)  Subject: Blahut    ABSTRACT    NCR-9415692  University of
              Illinois, Champaign-Urbana  Codes and Processing for Two-Dimensional Data
              Storage  Richard E. Blahut    This research is on two-dimensional communication
              waveforms and codes for  data storage systems of the future. Emphasis is placed
              on optical (and  magnetic) storage systems whose read mechanism can
              simultaneously sense  two-dimensional regions of the storage medium. Systems
              that employ a  one-dimensional array of read sensors against a moving medium
              form one type  of example. Systems that optically illuminate a patch of a
              stationary  medium and observe this patch (as with a photodetector array) form
              a second  type of example. Both kinds of physical systems are now under study
              in  industry and this proposed research is needed to support the evolution of 
              such systems.  The main topics are (1) Equalization and Bit  Synchronization,
              (2) Channel Modulation Codes for Data Translation, (3)  Error Control for
              Two-Dimensional Data Arrays, (4) Block Synchronization,  (5) Decoders for
              Algebraic Geometry Codes, and (6) Two-Dimensional  Information Theory. The goal
              is to nurture and develop a body of knowledge  on full-surface recording.  The
              approach will be of two kinds. The very  successful methods of communication
              theory and information theory will be  generalized, when possible, to two
              dimensions. In addition, new methods of  communication theory and information
              theory unique to two dimensions will  be developed. It is well known that the
              two-dimensional plane is much more  complicated than the one-dimensional line,
              so new mathematical phenomena  arise in the  design of two-dimensional
              waveforms and codes. The problems  are much more difficult but the rewards may
              be much greater.  Successful  completion of the research would provide (1)
              codes and waveforms for the  novel optical and magnetic storage devices of the
              upcoming decade, (2)  anticipated large improvement in storage density, (3)
              recommendations on  the architecture of future optical and magnetic storage
              devices, (4) new  insights into the classical one-dimensional communication
              waveforms, (5) a  fertile new information systems research area with strong
              connections to  deep problems both in physics and mathematics.
