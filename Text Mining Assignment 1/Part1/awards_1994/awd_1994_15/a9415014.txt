Abstract    :
              Myers:  The award to the Temple University School of Medicine will renovate and
              significantly  improve the animal care facility for pathogen-free mice needed
              in Developmental Biology  research activities.  The 30-year old, 5,000 square
              foot conventional animal facility will be  reconfigured and upgraded into a
              state-of-the-art barrier facility and will support a gene transfer  and
              targeting center for research and research training to support embryonic stem
              cell work and  transgenic mice.  Currently, inadequate configuration which
              defeats the clean/dirty corridor  system, obsolete instrumentation which
              affects environmental monitoring, and corrosion of  metallic surfaces impede
              good animal care, good science, and the validation of research results.   The
              modernized facility will provide research service, research training, and an 
              AAALAC-accredited animal resource for transgenic, breeding colonies of mice
              with  compromised immune systems and for specialized research equipment to
              conduct studies.  The  graduate research training program, which has grown
              dramatically over the past several years,  will be centered in this facility,
              and in excess of ten faculty researchers will benefit from this  renovation
              effort.
