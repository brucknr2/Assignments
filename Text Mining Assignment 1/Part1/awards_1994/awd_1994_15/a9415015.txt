Abstract    :
                The Tulane School of Engineering, established in 1894, has long been
              recognized for excellent undergraduate and graduate education, and for its
              research activities. To ensure the School's continued success, modern research
              facilities are essential. Therefore, the top priority of Tulane's Engineering
              Centennial Campaign is the renovation of outmoded buildings in the Engineering
              Complex, namely, Stanley Thomas Hall, which houses the Department of Electrical
              Engineering and Computer Science; the Civil Engineering Building, home to the
              Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering;  and a section of the
              Mechanical Services Building, that houses several computer science, civil
              engineering, and environmental engineering facilities. Both Stanley Thomas Hall
              and the Civil Engineering Building have served Tulane faculty and students well
              since the early 1900s.  However, these buildings have not kept pace with the
              technological advances of the 20th century, or the needs of the School's
              research faculty.  Last renovated in the 1950s, the buildings do not have the
              appropriate electrical, ventilation systems, or other utilities adequate for
              contemporary technology.  With the growing interdependence among engineering
              disciplines, research programs cannot excel if any of its components are unable
              to reach their full potential.  Funds from the Academic Research Infrastructure
              Program will assist the institution in its endeavor to renovate antiquated
              engineering research and research training facilities.  Renovations include the
              modernization of electrical, HVAC, and plumbing systems, provision of computer
              network capabilities, and fixed equipment.  In addition to enhancing current
              engineering research programs, the improved facilities will promote thriving
              interdisciplinary programs in robotics, and sensing, communication and
              computing. Furthermore, the renovations will provide the required support that
              will accelerate research in advanced materials and processing, advanced
              manufacturing technology and environmental research.
