Abstract    :
              9415447  Storm    The conference will be held on July 10-15, 1994 in New London,
              New  Hampshire.  It is focussed on recent advances in understanding the 
              fundamentals of the resistance of metals and alloys to aqueous  corrosion. 
              Individual sessions are concerned with: in-situ studies  of passive oxide
              films; structure and properties of passive oxides;  location and dissolution
              kinetics of active surface sites;  initiation and chemistry of localized
              corrosion; dissolution  mechanisms of metal alloys; corrosion of light metal
              alloys;  research/industry interactions; and atmospheric corrosion.    The
              emphasis of the conference is in areas of corrosion where  significant progress
              has recently been made and where new  approaches are being studied.  The
              speakers have been chosen  because of their unique knowledge and research. 
              Where appropriate  younger scientists have been chosen as speakers (half the
              speakers  fall within this category).  The speakers are from laboratories in 
              nine countries: eleven are from the USA, two from the UK, and one  from France,
              Germany, Japan, Norway, South Africa, Sweden, and  Switzerland.  This broad
              representation is intended to provide an  exposure to new studies not otherwise
              presented as US conferences.  %%%  A key to prolonging the life of components
              in the infrastructure is  understanding and controlling the processes of
              degradation through  corrosion.  This conference addressees many aspects of
              this  subject.  ***
