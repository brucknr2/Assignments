Abstract    :
               Serving students from the rural and urban areas of Washington State, Central
              Washington University is a regional university located near Seattle in a
              sparsely populated part of the state, east of the Cascade Mountain range. 
              Recent and anticipated revitalization of the Geology Department at Central
              Washington University has generated a need for an enhanced geologic research
              facility that accommodates modern approaches to conducting scientific inquiry
              and that immerses students in the  research experience.  To achieve this goal,
              the NSF will assist the department by providing partial support for the
              modernization of Lind Hall,  the facility that houses geological research
              activities.  The 1947 structure is  sound and the space currently devoted to
              the department is used to conduct  geological research including: Petrology,
              Structure, Tectonics, Geographic information Systems, Stratigraphy,
              Neotectonics, U-Pb geochronology, and Glaciology.  In addition to providing
              designated laboratory space for faculty and student researchers, the renovation
              project will provide new capabilities such as rock crushing and mineral
              separation capacity and appropriate storage areas for heavy liquids and high
              concentration acids.  The project will further support departmental and
              institutional efforts in the development of the university's strategic plan of
              establishing a Master's Degree program to be offered by the Geology
              Department.***  |        H H     + (с?сG Р F G ( n     H H     + (     d
