Abstract    :
              9415512  Samelson  This  project  is a theoretical and numerical  investigation 
              into  the  coupled  dynamics of the  large-  and  meso-scale  circulation.  
              The theoretical and conceptual work  will  be  based  on  two  sets  of coupled
              equations,  the  planetary-  geostrophic (PG) and quasi-geostrophic (QG)
              equations.   The  first  part  of  the study focuses on the  analysis  of  the 
              subpolar gyre circulation in numerical solutions of  the  PG  equations 
              without any effects of mesocale eddies (uncoupled  from  the  QG  component). 
              Double-gyre wind- and  buoyancy-  forced  solutions  of  the  PG  model  will 
              be  considered,  analyzed in detail, and compared to existing theories of the 
              gyre  regimes.  The second and third parts of the study will  continue  with
              the analysis of the coupled PG-QG  model  and  will  focus  on  the interaction
              between the  mesoscale  and  large-scale flows.
