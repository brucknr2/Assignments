Abstract    :
              9415445  Pecht      ABSTRACT      Work Force Retraining in Manufacturing Science
              and Engineering of Cost-Effective Electronics      The University of Maryland
              at College Park proposes to train current and future workforce to seek new
              manufacturing paradigms in a dual-use economy by emphasizing problem-solving
              and knowledge-synthesis skill.  Building on the strength of its State/Industry
              University Cooperative Research Center on Life Cycle Engineering in Electronic
              Packaging, its state-of-the-art facilities, and the participation by industry
              and DoD, DoC, and DoE laboratories, the project targets graduate and
              undergraduate students and industrial workers, with emphasis on those employed
              by regional small businesses.  Furthermore, through its strong ties with
              national societies and other academic institutions, especially those involved
              in the ECSEL Engineering Education Coalition, this project will undertake
              innovative curriculum, courseware and textbook development in the chosen
              technical areas.  ***
