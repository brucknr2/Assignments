Abstract    :
              This grant in the Chemistry Division  Special Projects Office provides   partial
              support for a workshop on "Research Opportunities in Pollution   Prevention for
              Chemists and Chemical Engineers: An Industrial   Perspective" which will be
              held October 29-30, 1994 in Gaithersburg, MD.    This workshop, which will be
              hosted by NIST and which has a projected   attendance of 100-125 people, is
              sponsored by the Council for Chemical   Research,  the NSF /MPS Division of
              Chemistry, the NSF/ENG Division of   Chemical and Transport Systems,  NIST, and
              the Center for Waste Reduction   Technology of the American Institute of
              Chemical Engineering.  The   purpose of the workshop is to define academic
              research opportunities in   chemistry and chemical engineering from an
              induatrial perspective.    Discussions of long-range industrial needs in
              environmentally benign   chemical synthesis will be framed in a format of
              plenary speakers and   panel discussions, and are intended to stimulate
              competitive,   industrially relevant proposals to NSF from the academic
              chemistry   community.
