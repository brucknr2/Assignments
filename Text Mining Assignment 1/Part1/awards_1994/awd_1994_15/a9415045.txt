Abstract    :
               The National Science Foundation and the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee are
              jointly funding renovation of the University of Wisconsin System Great Lakes
              Research Facility (GLRF).  The modernization will focus on laboratories for
              research and research training in geochemistry, biogeochemistry, microbiology,
              limnology, plankton ecology, and aquatic ecology/behavioral ecology.  The
              upgrades will provide modern research space in the building which was
              originally constructed in 1965 as a manufacturing plant  and subsequently
              outfitted for research in 1973 and 1978.     Specific improvements involve
              major changes to the basic infrastructure, as well as targeted laboratory and
              laboratory support facilities.  New plumbing facilities including drains,
              water, gas, deionized water and air delivery systems will be installed
              throughout the research space.  A two-way video/data LAN microwave link will be
              installed to connect the main UW-Milwaukee campus with the GLRF.  Finally, new
              fixed equipment including fume hoods, laboratory counters, walk-in
              refrigerators, growth chambers and incubators will be replaced or added, as
              appropriate, to a selected group of laboratories.
