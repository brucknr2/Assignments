Abstract    :
              Fisher  9415762  This research program, involving researchers from Indiana, Duke
              and Columbia Universities, proposes to investigate in detail the processes
              involved in circulation of hydrothermal fluids in a heavily sedimented setting
              adjacent to active hot springs on Juan de Fuca Ridge, a mid-ocean ridge
              spreading center located off Oregon, Washington and western Canada.  The
              specific programs proposed for the one-month field effort include studies of
              heat, chemical and fluid transport within the sedimentary section and the
              physical properties of those sediments.  The objective in acquiring this
              detailed, multi-component data set is to use  these three interdependent
              components to constrain and define models of the fluid pathways and chemical
              reactions, including the deposition of sulfide minerals within the mud and rock
              overlying the thermal vents.  The detailed program is possible in part because
              it uses cutting edge technology for heat flow and pore water measurement, 
              which this group of investigators has been instrumental in fostering and
              bringing to use.  Previous study at the two proposed sites includes drilling by
              the NSF-sponsored Ocean Drilling Program vessel JOIDES Resolution, and the new
              data allows extrapolation of results both areally (with new measurements from
              the upper 20 meters of the sediments) and with depth (with existing drilling
              data and planned future drill data, which is expected in the 1996-97 time
              frame) to define the 3-dimensional architecture of circulation and
              mineralization.  In addition to providing the first study at this level of
              detail over sedimented hot springs known to produce large mineralized deposits,
              the program will provide valuable data for precise selection of sites for
              future drilling.  ***
