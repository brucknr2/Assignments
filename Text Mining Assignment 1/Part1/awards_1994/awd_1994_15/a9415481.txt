Abstract    :
              Arctic ecosystems are sources of CH4 to the atmosphere, however,  fluxes are
              extremely variable over small spatial scales.  Therefore, large-scale
              measurements which integrate patch-scale  variability are needed to determine
              the magnitude of CH4  efflux.  Recent advances in laser technology have
              resulted in the  development of sensitive, rapid response CH4 sensors for 
              landscape-scale flux measurements.  However, many of these  instruments require
              elaborate support systems and large amounts  of power during operation, which
              inhibit their use in remote  field studies.  A fast response open path CH4
              sensor was recently  developed that does not require a large amount of
              extraneous  supplies for operation. Although this sensor appears to be 
              practical for use in remote flux studies, it is unknown whether  it is
              sensitive enough to resolve the small CH4  fluxes  characteristic of arctic
              ecosystems, or robustenough to withstand  the harsh arctic environment.
              Therefore, the sensor will be  tested on a portable eddy correlation tower in a
              variety of  arctic ecosystems for two weeks during the 1994 field season.  If 
              the field test is successful, the sensor may then be implemented  for future
              tower and/or aircraft-based eddy correlation flux  studies in remote arctic
              ecosystems.  This award is made under  the SGER (Small Grants for Exploratory
              Research) initiative. The  project is part of the Arctic System
              Science,Land/Atmosphere/Ice  Interactions Flux project.
