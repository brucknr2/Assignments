Abstract    :
              This three-year award will support U.S.-E.C. cooperative research on the
              analysis and implementation  of concurrent constraint programming.  The project
              involves cooperation between Gopal Gupta of New  Mexico State University and
              Moreno Falaschi of the University of Padua, Italy; Giorgio Levi of the 
              University of Pisa, Italy; Manuel Hermenegildo of the Polytechnic of Madrid,
              Spain; and Paul Soper and  Andrew King of Southampton University in the United
              Kingdom.  Their research will analyze and  implement logic programming systems
              and current constraint programming systems on multiprocessor  hardware.  The
              U.S. investigator brings to the collaboration experience in developing parallel
              logic  programming systems and designing implementations for concurrent
              constraint systems, specifically  those based on the Andorra Principle.  The
              European participants will contribute to the design of a  common intermediate
              language for implementation of concurrent constraint programming and parallel 
              logic programming, to the implementation of tools for parallel logic languages
              based on formal  analysis techniques, and to refining existing frameworks for
              the static analyses of concurrent  constraint logic programs.  The research
              results will not only advance the state-of-the-art in logic,  programming,
              parallel symbolic computing, and data-flow analysis, but also produce systems
              that can be  used.
