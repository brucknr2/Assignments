Abstract    :
              9415395  Mulchandani  The overall objective of this project is to develop two
              new assay  techniques for the quantitative determination of taxol and its 
              active analogs.  The techniques are based on the ability of taxol  to: (a) bind
              to tubulin; and (b) promote tubulin polymerization  to microtubules.  The
              ability of taxol to bind to tubulin is to  be used to develop a competition
              assay, while its ability to  promote tubulin polymerization is to be used to
              measure taxol and  its active analogs in extracts of yew trees and serum
              samples.  ***
