Abstract    :
              9415426  Vary    This Americas Program award will fund travel and  related
              expenses for a group of U.S., Central  American, and Caribbean scientists to
              participate in  an international conference on the development of  science
              research in Central America, to be held in  San Salvador, El Salvador, in
              October, 1994.   Organizers are Dr. James Vary, Iowa State  University, Ames,
              and Dr. Galileo Violini,  Universidad de El Salvador.  The objective is to 
              analyze the current status of science in the region  with the purpose of
              developing a program to build  research and education collaborations with the
              U.S.  and other developed nations. The U.S. participants  include noted
              scientists with strong interests in  promoting science education and research
              in  developing countries.      There is a widely recognized need to improve the
               level of science teaching and research in most  Central American and Caribbean
              countries.  Due  mostly to the low number of scientists at the  masters and
              doctorate levels in these countries,  there is an inadequate pool of properly
              prepared  college level science educators.  Consequently, few  significant
              programs of science research are  established . To address these issues over
              the long  term, topics of discussion during the conference  will include, among
              others, advanced studies  programs, modalities of realization, use of new 
              technologies for teaching and communication, and  establishment of
              international links between  research groups.  ***
