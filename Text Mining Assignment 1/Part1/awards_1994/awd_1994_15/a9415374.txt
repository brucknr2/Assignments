                As the demand for data integrity increases, coding for error control  becomes
              increasingly important in data transmission systems. It has become  an integral
              part in almost every data communication system design. Today  very
              sophisticated error control coding schemes are being used in a broad  range of
              data communication systems to achieve reliable data transmission.  The
              objective of this research project is to investigate several problems  in
              coding which are both theoretically and practically important. The  research
              includes three inter-related areas: (1) soft-decision decoding of  linear block
              codes; (2) trellis structure of linear block codes; and (3)  coded modulation. 
              In the first research area, the research will devise efficient  soft-decision
              decoding schemes for linear block codes to achieve optimum or  near optimum
              error performance with reduced decoding complexity. The  approaches to be taken
              include: (1) hard-decision decoding based on certain  reliability measures of
              the received symbols; (2) iterative reprocessing of  the hard-decision decoded
              word until optimum or near optimum error  performance is achieved; (3)
              searching for the maximum likelihood solution  through a purged trellis diagram
              for the code to be decoded; and (4)  multistage soft-decision decoding based on
              code decomposition. In the  second research area, the trellis structure of
              linear block codes is  investigated in terms of the state complexity, the
              branch complexity, the  state connectivity  and parallel structure of minimal
              trellis diagrams. For  codes with simple trellis structure, the Viterbi
              algorithm can be applied  to achieve maximum likelihood decoding with reduced
              computational  complexity. Other problems to be investigated in this area
              include: (1)  construction of minimal trellis diagrams for known codes; (2)
              finding  specific permutations on the bit positions of codes that minimize or
              reduce  the structural complexity of code trellises; and (3) state and branch 
              labeling. In the third research area, the investigation of coded modulation 
              will be continued for bandwidth efficient communications. Modulation codes  for
              both AWGN and fading channels will be constructed and analyzed.  Emphasis is
              placed in constructing modulation codes or coded modulation  systems to achieve
              high performance with reduced decoding complexity. One  approach to be taken is
              to combine coded modulation and product coding  technique. Unequal error
              protection modulation codes will also be  investigated.  The research is
              intended to advance the state of knowledge  in coding theory and error control
              techniques. Fruitful results from this  study will have significant impact on
              coding research and the design of  efficient error control systems for reliable
              data communications.
