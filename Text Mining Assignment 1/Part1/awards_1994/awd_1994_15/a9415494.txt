Abstract    :
              This proposal is for, "Experimentally Probing the Unknowns  of
              Sonoluminescence".  Sonoluminescence is the emission of  visible radiation from
              cavitation bubbles of gas produced in  a liquid by standing sound waves.  The
              bubbles are trapped  at nodes of the standing sound waves and at high intensity
               the pulsations of the bubble with pressure oscillations of  the sound wave are
              large enough to prevent the bubble from  dissolving into the surrounding
              liquid.  At higher levels of  sound, a threshold is reached at which the bubble
              motion  abruptly switches to a state where pulsations are so  enormous and
              nonlinear that the resulting supersonic inward  collapse of the bubble
              concentrates the acoustic energy by  over 13 orders of magnitude, so as to emit
              picosecond  flashes of broad band light which extend well into the  ultraviolet
              and which, furthermore, are synchronous with the  sound field to picosecond
              accuracy.  This phenomena is not  understood but it has been shown to have
              large effects in  catalyzing some chemical processing, in causing erosion of 
              hardened metal surfaces and possibly in forming new  materials.
