Abstract    :
              9415204  Dooley  This is an important and timely scientific meeting on the
              subject of Quinone and Redox-Active Amino Acid Cofactors.  This particular
              meeting is one of many Winter Gordon Research Conferences, a highly-respected
              and influential series of conferences that emphasizes the most recent
              developments on the frontiers of modern research.  The Gordon Research
              Conference on Quinone and Redox-Active Amino Acid Cofactors, to be held in
              February 1995, provides an unique and proven format for scientific exchanges
              among the numerous investigators concerned with this rapidly developing field. 
              At this conference the most current research on quinone and amino acid radical
              cofactors in enzymes will be presented and discussed.  All aspects of the basic
              biochemistry, biophysics, and molecular biology of these systems  will be
              covered. NSF funds will be used to support the attendance of well-qualified
              young investigators who otherwise would have a difficult time attending,
              especially those from groups who are under-represented in U. S. science.  %%% 
              This Gordon Conference is concerned with the generation, fate, and roles of
              oxidized amino acids and protein radicals. Collectively the topics to be
              covered are relevant to a wide variety of biological and physiological
              processes,  including cell proliferation and differentiation, connective tissue
              metabolism, aging and cell death, and energy conservation.  ***
