Abstract    :
              Bolin  This  project is being funded as part of the National  Earthquake 
              Hazards  Reduction Program's investigation into  the  causes  and  effects  of 
              the  January  17, 1994 Northridge  earthquake.   The  research   will,  in  a 
              multi-site  and  comparative  framework,  identify  and analyze a comprehensive
              range of disaster  response  and  recovery issues among victims of diverse
              ethnic/cultural and  socioeconomic   characteristics  in  Ventura  and   Los  
              Angeles  Counties.  The analysis will include an examination of the  roles  of 
              governmental  agencies  in providing  assistance  to  diverse  victim groups
              concentrating on intermediate to long-term recovery  issues.  In addition, the
              role of non-governmental organizations,  neighborhood  associations, and other
              locally based organizations  that  have responded to the recovery needs of
              victim groups  will  be documented.  ***
