Abstract    :
              9415344  Eagar      ABSTRACT      Manufacturing Internship Enhancement as
              Outreach to Small and Medium Enterprises    The Massachusetts Institute of
              Technology, will expand its Leaders for Manufacturing (LFM) Program to include
              internships in small and medium manufacturers.  Built completely on
              private-sector resources, LFM is well known as an innovative program and one of
              the most important benchmarks in the field.  However, it has been limited
              mostly to large firms due to the cost of implementing some of the unique
              features of the program.  With TRP funding, small and medium firms will be able
              to participate with benefit to both students and member firms.  The program
              draws active participation from both the Management and Engineering Schools in
              stressing the practical aspects of manufacturing while taking into account
              fundamental principles.  ***
