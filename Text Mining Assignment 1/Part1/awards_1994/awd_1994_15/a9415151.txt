Abstract    :
              Hornbach  NSF funding of $500,000 will be used to support the renovation,
              repair, and  reconfiguration of selected research and research training
              laboratories for the  Departments of Biology, Chemistry, Geology,
              Mathematics/Computer Science,  Physics and Psychology at Macalester College. 
              This newly-designed space will  provide efficient and updated space in support
              of faculty research, faculty-student  research collaborations and independent
              upper-level student research and research  training.  The renovated
              laboratories and research support space will be located in  Olin Hall of
              Science, part of the college s Olin-Rice science complex.  The NSF-  sponsored
              renovations will occur within Macalester s major renovation and  construction
              project to improve Olin and Rice Halls which were constructed in 1965  and 1971
              respectively.  The effort is designed to support the increasingly laboratory- 
              rich, research-based, interdisciplinary approach to learning science.  The
              entire  project will bring the facility into compliance with current safety and
              access codes and  will reconfigure current space that is highly
              compartmentalized inhibiting  collaborative research and research training
              among the scientific disciplines.  Fifteen  faculty members and approximately
              45 students will be direct beneficiaries of the NSF  project.  Macalester plans
              to make eight new appointments within the sciences by the  year 2000,
              complementing the twenty new research-active science faculty that have  been
              hired since 1984.  ***
