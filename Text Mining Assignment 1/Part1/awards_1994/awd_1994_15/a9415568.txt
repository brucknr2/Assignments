Abstract    :
              9415568  EGLINGTON    This ancient, and potentially refractory material is
              particularly  difficult to quantify, and represents an unknown ("hidden") 
              component of the total organic carbon (TOC) in marine sediments.   The reason
              for the paucity of information lies in the difficulty in  making direct
              measurements of this elusive carbon pool.  Kerogen,  the dominant fraction of
              organic carbon in sedimentary rocks is  difficult to characterize, being inert
              and lacking structural  characteristicity.  The PI proposes to use the fact
              that weathered  carbon will, by definition, have an infinite radiocarbon age
              (i.e.  "14C-dead") to determine its significance in marine sediments.  
              Specifically, the PI will radiocarbon date individual sedimentary  organic
              compounds in order to establish discrete ages for different  OC pools. The
              overall objectives of the proposed project are to:    1.) Determine the age
              distribution of co-deposited sedimentary          organic matter,    2.) Assess
              the proportion of weathered (14C-dead) organic carbon in      recent marine
              sediments.
