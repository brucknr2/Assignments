Abstract    :
              9415675  Cartledge    This U.S.-Brazil Cooperative Science Program award
              supports  travel expenses and expendable research supplies for  work  to be
              conducted by  Prof.  F. Cartledge and  Dr. M.  Titlebaum, both of  Louisiana
              State University (LSU),  Louisiana, with Dr. P. Buchler, Univ. of Sao Paulo,
              Brazil.  Drs. Cartledge, Titlebaum and Buchler are conducting  research on the
              solidification/stabilization of  hazardous  wastes using cementitious binders,
              a common technology  applied to waste streams, mostly of heavy metal containing
               wastes.    The use of organoclays as additives in the process has the 
              potential for greatly expanding the utility of the method,  particularly for
              the treatment of mixed waste streams and  contaminated soils, where organic as
              well as inorganic  wastes are present.  The research groups at LSU and Sao 
              Paulo have unique and complementary capabilities.  The LSU  group is noted for
              experience with solid state nuclear  magnetic resonance spectroscopy, while the
              Sao Paulo group  has broad experience with real waste streams and  the design 
              of mixes that are effective for the immobilization of  organic containing
              wastes.  The proposed research will  involve sample preparation in Brazil, and
              the examination of  spectroscopic and other properties at LSU.  The LSU group 
              will benefit from the Brazilian groups' expertise in clay  uses and
              modifications, while the Sao Paulo group will  benefit from access to modern
              instrumentation for solid  characterization.    ***
