Abstract    :
                Farr Hall of Science, constructed  in 1960,  is home to the departments of
              biology, chemistry, and physics on the campus of Ripon College located in
              Wisconsin.  The facility will be remodeled to alleviate several major problems
              that inhibit research and research training and detracts from the overall
              quality of the college's science programs.  As  part of a larger  comprehensive
              renovation and expansion effort,  the NSF's Academic Research Infrastructure
              Program, in partnership with Ripon College, will provide funds to modernize
              existing space dedicated to research activities.  Renovations will include:
              replacement of air circulation and ventilation systems, installation of fume
              hoods where volatile substances are used, reconfiguration of laboratories to
              provide more efficient space for student research activities, provision of
              adequate space for instrumentation and computers, upgrading electrical and
              mechanical systems, and ensuring research spaces are made fully accessible to
              physically challenged persons.   Once completed, the renovated science facility
              will provide modern research and research training space and will create a safe
              and healthy environment.  As a result, an improved research climate will
              contribute to Ripon's recruitment of outstanding students and faculty and in
              maintenance of strong educational  and  undergraduate research programs.
