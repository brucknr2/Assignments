Abstract    :
              This study continues the analysis of data obtained using the two-frequency, 
              narrowband sodium temperature lidar at Colorado State University.  The lidar
              has  been operating for three years and 147 nights of observations have been
              made.  The  data will be used to study heating mechanisms, tidal effects,
              effects of solar cycle and  volcanic eruption, and annual and semi-annual
              temperature variations in the  mesopause.  The study will help modelers
              fine-tune their model parameters and  understand the physics behind the unique
              climatology in the mesopause region which  impacts global change.  The proposed
              effort also includes the continuation of regular  observations to establish the
              long-term trends in atmospheric temperatures and to  investigate tidal and
              gravity wave perturbations.  These data will help to test model  predictions of
              the anthropogenic effects on global warming and contribute to our 
              understanding of the balance between dynamical and radiative forces in the
              middle  atmosphere.
