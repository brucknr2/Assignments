Abstract    :
              The Center of Reproduction of Endangered Species (CRES) is located in a 900
              square meter  facility on the grounds of the San Diego Zoo.  The Center is the
              multidisciplinary research and  conservation branch of the Zoological Society
              of San Diego.  The mission of CRES is to broadly  examine, through bench and
              field endeavors, the requirements for self-sustaining populations of  animals,
              especially those now critically threatened with extinction.  Eight general
              disciplines are  represented at CRES:  behavior, comparative physiology,
              endocrinology, genetics, infectious  diseases, pathology, reproductive
              physiology, and virology and immunology.  Research is  conducted in the main
              CRES building that was last renovated in 1964.  Although structurally  sound,
              the current configuration of laboratory space impedes faculty from conducting
              modern  research.  The existing cabinetry and work stations that were
              originally installed are inefficient  with respect to utilization of available
              space. Because the laboratories were designed for initially  designed for
              diagnostic purposes, most of the laboratory areas use space poorly.  ARI funds
              will  be used to renovate support facilities and reconfigurate space for three
              laboratories:   endocrinology, cytogenetics, and recombinant DNA studies.  Each
              laboratory will have new  casework, and workstations that will dramatically
              increase the productivity of research activities .   The renovated facility
              will accommodate more visiting scholars, and students at all academic  levels,
              enhancing the quality of the research and research training programs.
