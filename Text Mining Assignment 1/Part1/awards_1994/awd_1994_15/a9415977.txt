Abstract    :
              This proposal is for the continuation of thermospheric tidal  studies being
              conducted with the NCAR thermosphere/ionosphere  general circulated models. 
              The proposed project addresses detailed  understanding of the lower
              thermosphere global dynamics and  mesosphere/thermosphere coupling.  The
              investigator plans to  conduct and disseminate the results of NCAR model
              simulations in  support of CEDAR campaigns and working groups.  Moreover, she
              will  continue to refine, update, and validate the theoretical models.
