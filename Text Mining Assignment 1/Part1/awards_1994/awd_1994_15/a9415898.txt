Abstract    :
              9415898    Giese    This   is  a  numerical  study  of  mesoscale  eddies   that
               occasionally (but regularly) develop in the eastern tropical  North  Pacific, 
              which can be detected  in  TOPEX  altimeter  data.  Three generation mechanisms
              for these eddies will  be  investigated:  (1) the intense, primarily 
              wintertime,  wind  events  that  blow  at  near-hurricane  strength  from   the
               Atlantic  to  the  Pacific  through  mountain  passes;   (2)  instabilities 
              of  the  equatorial  currents;  and,  (3)   a  seasonally modulated instability
              at the eastern end  of  the  North  Equatorial  Counter Current.  These 
              process-oriented  numerical studies will be carried out using two models,  the 
              reduced  gravity model of Chang and the GFDL  Modular  Ocean  Model (MOM).
