Abstract    :
              9415983  Schilling    This is a multiprong analyical investigation of the origin
               of the Easter-Sala y Gomez seamount and island chain in the  southeast Pacific
              Ocean.  At present there are four models  for the origin of the chain: simple
              hotspot chain, leaky  fracture zone, hot line delineating the limbs of two 
              ascending convection cells, and plume-ridge interaction.  The principal
              investigators have collected rocks containing  fresh glass during two cruises
              to the chain.  In this  project they will obtain radiometric dates on the
              samples  and determine the chemical and isotopic composition of the  samples
