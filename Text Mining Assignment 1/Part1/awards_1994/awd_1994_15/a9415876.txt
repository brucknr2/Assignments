Abstract    :
                This two-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative research in
              theoretical nuclear physics.  The American and French investigators are Stuart
              Pittel of the Bartol Research Institute at the University of Delaware and
              Jonathan Engel of the University of North Carolina and Piet van Isacker of
              GANIL (Grand Accelerateur National d' Ions Lourds) in Caen, France.  The
              objective of their research is the application of nuclear structure techniques
              to astrophysical nucleosynthesis.  They will study beta decay from neutron rich
              `waiting point` nuclei which play an important role in the r-process. 
              Subsequently, they will develop techniques for studying p-process beta decay.  
               The U.S. investigators bring to this collaboration their expertise in
              calculations as applied to nuclear astrophysics.  This is complemented by the
              French experimental studies in nuclei far from stability.   The project takes
              advantage of combined expertise in nuclear structure calculations and of access
              to excellent facilities and equipment at GANIL.
