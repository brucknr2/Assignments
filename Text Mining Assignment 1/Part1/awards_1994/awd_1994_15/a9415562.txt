Abstract    :
              9415562  BACON    The primary objective of this project is to develop a new
              procedure  for the chemical analysis of seawater that will permit the 
              naturally occurring radionuclides thorium-230 (half-life 75,000  years) and
              protactinium-231 (half-life 32,000 years) to be measured  in the same sample.
              The new procedure will employ mass-  spectrometric techniques of measurement
              and is intended to replace  currently used procedures based on
              alpha-spectrometry. It is  expected that significant improvements in
              sensitivity, precision,  and speed of analysis will be realized. The reasons
              for the special  focus on this particular pair of radionuclides are that (1)
              they  provide unique information about the flux of particular matter in  the
              oceans and the scavenging processes that regulate the level of  a number of
              chemical species, and (2) they can be important tools  for deciphering the
              sedimentary record of climate over the last  glacial cycle.  Improved data on
              the distributions of the two  radionuclides will permit better testing and
              validation of their  use as oceanographic tracers.  After the new procedures
              are  perfected, a study of the distribution of thorium-230 and 
              protactinium-231 in the western North Atlantic Ocean will be  undertaken.  This
              part of the project will provide a full-scale  demonstration of the new
              procedures and is expected to reveal  features of the distribution that cannot
              presently be resolved.
