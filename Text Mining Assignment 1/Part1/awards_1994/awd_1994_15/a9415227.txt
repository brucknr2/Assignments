Abstract    :
              9415227  Thomson    This dissertation enhancement award supports  three research
              visits in Japan over a three-  year period for Neal Williams, a graduate 
              student at the State University of New York at  Stonybrook, who works under the
              direction of  Professor James Thomson, Department of Ecology  and Evolution. 
              This is a collaborative project  with Professor Izumi Washitani, Institute of 
              Biological Sciences, University of Tsukuba.     Attempts to conserve rare
              plants often involve  the establishment of small natural reserves  surrounded
              by inimical habitat.  In principle,  such plants may risk reproductive failure
              due  to the decline of pollinators.  However, there  have been few if any
              thorough studies, and  management plans for plants seldom consider  pollinator
              management.  This project is a  collaboration between a Japanese botanist and 
              American bee ecologists to investigate such a  situation in a wild native
              primrose, Primula  seiboldii.  This plant experiences seed-set  failure in an
              urban reserve north of Tokyo, and  a variety of evidence suggests that this is 
              because native bumble bees have disappeared  from the area.  The project is
              expected to  solve a particular problem and also to draw the  attention of
              conservationists to such problems  and their solubility.  It is hoped that this
               project will be come a demonstration project  for native bee recovery. 
              Exploiting this  special opportunity is important to improving  conservation
              plans worldwide and for  emphasizing the interdependence of species in  nature.
