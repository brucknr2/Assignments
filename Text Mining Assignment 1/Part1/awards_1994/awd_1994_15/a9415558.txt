Abstract    :
              ***  9415558  Shock    This three-year award will support U.S.-France
              cooperative  research in geochemistry between Everest L. Shock of  Washington
              University and Vladimir Mayer of the University  of Blaise Pascal.  The
              objective of their research is to  test models of thermodynamic data with
              experimental  measurements for a wide variety of aqueous inorganic and  organic
              fluids.  Minerals, gases, organic compounds,  microorganisms and the byproducts
              of human activity are  brought into contact by aqueous fluids in relatively
              shallow  regions of the earth's crust.  These fluids facilitate  reactions
              which would otherwise be sluggish.  Accurate  thermodynamic data for dissolved
              ions, electrolytes, gases,  and organic compounds are needed to develop
              predictive  models.    Dr. Shock brings to this collaboration his expertise in 
              theoretical geochemistry.  He has developed a model for  prediction of
              thermodynamic data for thousands of aqueous  organic and inorganic species. 
              Data are incomplete or  wholly lacking at high temperatures.  The French 
              investigator, Dr. Mayer, has worked for a number  of years  in the generation
              of high temperature measurements for these  species.  His experimental work
              will provide the high  temperature data that are needed to extend the accuracy
              and  applicability of the existing model.  Their joint effort  will advance our
              understanding of sub-surface earth  processes and improve current efforts to
              contain, and  eventually avoid environmental problems.  ***
