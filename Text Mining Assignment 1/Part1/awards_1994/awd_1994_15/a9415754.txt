Abstract    :
              9415754  Neuhoff       This project addresses the development of the theory and 
              practice ofstructured vector quantizers for signal compression of  sources such
              as speech, images, video and music.  Though the cost  of storing and
              transmitting information continues to decrease, such  reductions seem only to
              stimulate demand for information and,  consequently, for further developments
              in compression.  Structured  vector quantizers from a class of compression
              techniques that hold  significant promise for gains in performance.  This
              project will  develop theory to increase the qualitative and quantitative 
              understanding of the performance of structured vector quantizers,  particularly
              the tradeoffs between performance and complexity.  It will analyze a number of
              specific structured vector quantizers.   In addition, it will develop new
              structured quantization  approaches. The methodology is largely, but not
              exclusively, based  on asymptotic quantization theory techniques and concepts.
              The  analysis and developments are for fixed and variable-rate  quantizers that
              minimize rate with respect to squared error and  perceptual fidelity criteria.
