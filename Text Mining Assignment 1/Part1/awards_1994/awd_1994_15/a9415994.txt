Abstract    :
              9415994  Rea       The project aims at establishing a direct tie between 
              regional climatic and lake histories by linking the  paleolimnological record
              of the lake fluctuations, melt water and  microfauna and flora.  It will extend
              the paleoclimatic record,  especially the annual variability record back to
              Younger Drayas.  Oxygen isotope measurements on ostracode valves, and faunal 
              studies will establish a temporal framework.  AMS dates will  provide absolute
              chronology.  Synthetic seismograms of core  sediments will link them to seismic
              records.  Physical properties  measurements and pollen studies will tie the
              history of lake  levels to climatic history.  A coring, side-scan and seismic 
              profiling cruise is planned in mid 1995 in Lakes Michigan and  Huron.  ***
