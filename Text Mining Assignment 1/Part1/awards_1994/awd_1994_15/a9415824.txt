Abstract    :
              9403668  Wilcock       The distribution and characteristics of microearthquake 
              activity across the Endeavor segment of the Juan de Fuca ridge  will be studied
              by deploying a network of 15 ocean bottom  seismometers for a two month period.
               The array will span the  axial valley in the vicinity of the main vent field
              and the  western flanks out to about 15 km.  The objectives of the  experiment
              are to characterize the distribution and nature of off-  axis microearthquake
              activity and to use these data to evaluate  and refine existing models of the
              tectonic evolution of yound  oceanic crust as it moves off axis, and to
              estimate the depth of  the brittle-ductile transition from the maximum depth of
               seismicity as a function of distance from the ridge axis.  ***
