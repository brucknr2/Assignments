Abstract    :
                  Pressure swing membrane absorption-permeation (PSMABP) is to be demonstrated
              and examined for the removal of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in this SGER
              project.  In PSMABP, air or N2 containing VOCs will be introduced into a hollow
              fiber module and separated by a cyclic process.  VOCs in N2/air will
              selectively permeate the walls of one set of microporous hollow feed fibers,
              absorb into an inert high boiling mineral oil, and then emerge into a second
              set of evacuated strip fibers.    This project can help industry and government
              to address the cleanup of VOC contaminated air streams mandated by the Clean
              Air Act.  The technique to be explored is expected to overcome certain problems
              with current technologies.
