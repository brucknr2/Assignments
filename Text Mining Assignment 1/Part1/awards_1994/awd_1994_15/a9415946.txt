Abstract    :
              9415946  Beach       This award will complete a previously-funded project in 
              which the authors built a new fiber-optic sensor and deployed it  in two field
              experiments to monitor sediment transport in the  swash zone.  This award will
              support analysis of the data, to  determine (1) the balance between erosion (by
              infragravity waves)  and accretion (by incident band energy); (2) the role of 
              microtopography, (3) the short-term distribution of resuspended  sediment, and
              (4) the importance of supercritical flow.  The  results will contribute to
              understanding sediment erosion and  redistribution on beaches.  ***
