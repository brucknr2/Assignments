Abstract    :
              9415480  Rauch    This research will develop a theoretical  model of 
              bureaucratic institutions. The project is based on the idea  that the creation
              of salaried professional bureaucrats  changes the way government functions,
              because it changes the  incentive mechanisms facing bureaucrats. Governments
              which  have this kind of bureauractic structure tend to take a  longer view of
              the benefits from public expenditures  decisions. This means that they will
              tend at the margin to  allocate a greater proportion of government resources to
               infrastructure projects that have a more distant payoff. The  theoretical
              model is developed in which city government is  modelled in a principal-agent
              framework. The principal is  the elected official and the agents are the civil
              servants.  Then the  model is extended to bureaucratic institutions in  less
              developed countries, in which it can be shown that  merit-based promotion
              policies tend to reduce corruption and  enhance the efficiency of government.
              The models are tested  using data for U.S. cities in the early part of this
              century  that experienced a wave of muinicipal reform. Next the  theory is put
              to a more direct test to ascertain whether  less-developed countries with
              merit-based promotion systems  will exhibit higher growth rates, all else
              equal, than those  that do not. Data on growth rates of the less-developed 
              countries are used.       This project is of significant interest because it 
              attempts to link bureauratic structure with efficiency in  the provision of
              governmental goods and services. The  results from the study promise to give us
              an understanding  of the relationship between bureaucratic performance and 
              economic growth.
