Abstract    :
              9415428  Olgac  A control strategy incorporating position feedback with a 
              designed time delay is used for dynamic suppression of structural  vibrations.
              The delay in feedback leads to an effective vibration  absorber which is
              tunable in real time over an extended frequency  range. The piezoelectric
              actuation and vibration absorption  techniques are combined to exhibit high
              amplitude fidelity over a  wide bandwidth. The new vibration absorber is of
              immediate use in  machine tool, aerospace and microprocessor disk storage 
              industries. Pratt and Whitney is a cosponsor of this GOALI  project in view of
              a need to eliminate high frequency gear box  oscillations. Piezoelectric
              actuation with delayed resonator  techniques are specially suited for such
              implementations.  ***
