Abstract    :
              9415275  Ulsoy  This research project deals with the design and development of 
              repetitive controllers where it is desired for the control system  to track
              periodic reference signals and minimize the effects of  periodic disturbances
              inputs for a clan of nonlinear systems: A  first level of adaptation is used to
              minimize or eliminate the  effects of deterministic, possibly unknown and/or
              time-varying  disturbance inputs. Subsequently, a parameterizing mapping is 
              adjusted online. At a second level, adaptation is used to  minimize the effects
              of plant model uncertainties on the tracking  performance of the control
              system. The results of this research  are applied to machine tool and robot arm
              control for high  accuracy machining and path tracking respectively.  ***
