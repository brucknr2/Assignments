Abstract    :
              9415991  Lea       This project will continue experimental culturing of 
              planktic foraminifera to determine the biogeochemistry of stable  isotopes and
              trace elements incorporated in the shell.  This kind  of data is widely used by
              people who reconstruct past ocean  circulation and chemistry from marine
              microfossils, and yet many  of the assumptions about the controls on shell
              chemistry have  never been tested.  ***
