Abstract    :
              9415385  Sung  The objective of this research is to extend intrinsic and
              extrinsic  UV and fluorescence techniques to important polymers such as vinyl 
              polymers, bismaleimide and polyureaurethane.  In-situ reaction  monitoring
              techniques will be developed and applied for these three  types of polymers by
              specially designed fiber-optic instruments  using the external reflection
              ultraviolet and fluorescence  techniques, by taking advantage of the spectral
              changes as a  function of polymerization.    %%%  In addition to the
              development and application of these in-situ  cure monitoring techniques, an
              additional benefit of this research  is the design and introduction of the
              transportable ultraviolet and  fluorescence fiber optic instruments with
              specially designed  attachments and analytical cure software, that can be used
              in the  manufacturing environment.
