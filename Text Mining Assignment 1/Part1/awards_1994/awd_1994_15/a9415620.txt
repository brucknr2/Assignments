Abstract    :
              The purpose of this study is to perform a detailed analysis of  unusually high
              nighttime electron temperature events (NETEs), which  are regularly observed by
              the Millstone Hill radar.  Studying these  events will improve understanding of
              the nature of the particle and  heat coupling between the ionosphere,
              plasmasphere, and conjugate  ionosphere.  Ultimately, this study will determine
              the cause of  these events and their behavior, as well as lead to a better 
              understanding of the nature of plasmapause processes.  To  accomplish this,
              detailed case studies will be performed on data  already in the CEDAR data
              base.  Also, new high quality data will  be obtained at Millstone Hill,
              allowing the determination of  particle and heat fluxes.  Finally, this study
              should help to  resolve the current discrepancy between modeled and measured 
              ionospheric electron densities at night.
