Abstract    :
              9415257  Leimkuhler       This project is a pilot study of a collaborative
              model, using  graduate student "externships" to demonstrate a method for 
              universities to interact with small companies.  An externship is  defined as
              having a graduate student work under the supervision of  faculty advisors on
              problems which have both commercial and  academic significance.       Three
              specific extern projects will be done by three  engineering graduate students
              with different areas, advisors, and  companies. These pilot projects will help
              resolve the financial,  legal, and marketing challenges of such a program.  It
              is intended  that this concept will aid in the U.S. efforts to improve the 
              manufacturing capability of the small- and medium-size firms.
