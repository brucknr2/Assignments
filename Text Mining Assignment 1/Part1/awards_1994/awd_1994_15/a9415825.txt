Abstract    :
              Barros  9415825    This U.S.-Brazil Joint Seminar award supports travel 
              expenses of 15 U.S. participants in a workshop on  Multidimensional Complex
              Analysis and Partial Differential  Equations.  U.S. organizers of the meeting
              are Drs. J.  Barros-Neto and S. Gindikin of Rutgers University, and the 
              Brazilian co-P.I. is Dr. P. Cordaro of the University of Sao  Paulo.    The
              workshop will survey recent progress in the fields of  several complex
              variables and partial differential  equations, and promote further research in
              both fields.  The  meeting will focus on recent results and future perspectives
               in the theory of CR manifolds, hyperfunctions, and  overdetermined systems of
              differential equations.  U.S. and  Brazilian scientists have close ties in
              these areas, and the  workshop will provide guidance to younger researchers in
              the  field, stimulate further progress, and involve a new  generation of U.S.
              and Brazilian mathematicians in the  research.  ***
