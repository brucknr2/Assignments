Abstract    :
              Dunning    The objectives of the research are 1) to investigate ultra-  low
              energy electron-molecule collisions using high Rydberg  atoms, 2) to examine
              the response of highly excited atoms to  electric fields of short duration and
              3) to investigate the  behavior of atoms near a solid surface.  The use of
              highly  excited Rydberg atoms now enables these experiments to be  carried out
              under conditions which will produce meaningful  data which can be compared to
              theory.
