Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program will
              provide partial  support for the International Conference of Carbon Dioxide
              Utilization (I.C.C.D.U.) to be held  at the University of Oklahoma, April
              30-May 4, 1995.  Dr. Kenneth M. Nicholas is co-chair  of the organizing
              committee and a member of the international scientific committee administering 
              the conference.  Two meetings on this topic have been held previously, one in
              Italy and one in  Japan; this is the first meeting to be held in the United
              States.  Approximately 250 scientists,  engineers and students will exchange
              the latest research and development findings pertaining to  the utilization of
              carbon dioxide.  New developments in this area are essential for such long-term
               goals as the use of carbon dioxide as a feedstock for industrial chemicals
              production, new  technologies for carbon dioxide fixation, utilization of
              supercritical carbon dioxide as an  environmentally benign solvent, and
              improved methods for reducing carbon dioxide atmospheric  emissions.
