Abstract    :
              9415552  Mathis    This is a three year project to produce an enhanced TCP to
              support high performance applications over national scale, high latency, high
              bandwidth networks.  The basic purpose is to eliminate TCP as a bottleneck for
              this environment.  The three parts of the proposal are developing tools for
              validating TCP implementations, developing a simulator for use over production
              networks, and developing and testing TCP enhancements.
