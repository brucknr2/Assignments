Abstract    :
              941583  Gorsline    This Americas Program award will support the doctoral 
              dissertation research of two students, M.C. Enrique Nava  Sanchez, and M.C.
              Janette Murillo de Nava, under the  direction of Dr. Donn Gorsline, University
              of Southern  California, Los Angeles, on coastal studies in Baja  California
              Sur, Mexico.  The goal of the project is to  obtain a comparative understanding
              of little known arid and  semiarid coastal types.  Emphasis will be in two
              areas: the  fan-deltas of the Gulf of California coast of Baja  California Sur 
              and the semi-arid Magdalena Coastal Plain of  the Central Pacific coast of Baja
              California.  These  tectonically active areas provide a unique opportunity to 
              contrast broad coastal plain evolution with steep mountain  fan-delta coasts
              under similar climatic conditions.    Fan-delta deposits are very important
              potential  stratigraphic hydrocarbon reservoirs.  In the study area  they serve
              as ground water reservoirs and as main habitation  areas.  An understanding of
              their geometry, architecture,  physical properties and physiography is thus of
              considerable  significance.  Modern work on fan-deltas has been mainly  done in
              glacial or humid areas and models for the deposits  are based on outercrops in
              East Greenland and their  occurrences in the North Sea.  By diversifying the
              climatic  and physiographic setting, this study will provide an  important
              addition to the field of sedimentology and to  ongoing studies in Arctic fjords
              and protected waters  elsewhere.    ***  .
