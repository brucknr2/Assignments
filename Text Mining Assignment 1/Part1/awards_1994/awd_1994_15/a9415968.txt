Abstract    :
              9415968  Grove       Experiments designed to examine the diffusion of Ti, Ce,
              Yb,  Th, and U in pyroxene are planned to understand melting and melt 
              transport beneath mid-ocean ridges.  This information can be used  to interpret
              the composition of magmas that erupt at ocean  ridges.  This will lead to a
              better understanding of the  conditions of melting, and whether melting occurs
              under  equilibrium or disequilibrium conditions.  Experiments will be  done in
              piston cylinder high-pressure furnaces at pressures and  temperatures that are
              relevant to melting in the upper mantle.  Analysis of run products will be done
              with the ion microprobe.  The measurement of the diffusion rates of elements
              that may have  different rates could also tell us something on the rate of 
              melting.  ***
