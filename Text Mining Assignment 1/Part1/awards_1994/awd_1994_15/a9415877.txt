Abstract    :
              Kimmel       The investigator and his colleagues organize a conference on  the
              mathematical modeling of heterogeneous biological populations.  The topics
              concern populations of genes (including dynamics of  genome evolution),
              populations of cells and tumors, as well as the  natural history of cancer, and
              selected topics from epidemiology  such as AIDS.  These biological topics are
              integrated with the  mathematical topics of branching processes, stochastic
              models,  random walks, spacial processes, structured populations,  semigroups
              of operators, and dynamical systems.  This selection of  subjects is motivated
              by recent advances in the mathematical  theory of populations and in new data
              available from various  branches of molecular and cellular biology, and
              biomedical  sciences.       The aim of the conference is to provide an
              interdisciplinary  international forum for an exchange of views and experiences
               between biologists working on real life data and mathematicians  developing
              and analyzing model equations.  Special efforts are made  to facilitate a
              mutual understanding between the usually disparate  groups of theoreticians and
              experimentalists, and between  established scientists and younger colleagues. 
              The conference  fosters exchanges between mathematicians and quantitative 
              biologists in the relevant fields from the the west with  colleagues from
              Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
