Abstract    :
                  9415328  Washabaugh  This SGER type award is to construct a protype
              transducer employing  finite length optic measurement paths.  The performance
              of this  transducer will be evaluated for its sensitivity in torsion and its 
              cross-sensitivity to other types of loading.  Errors related to  manufacturing
              and locating the transducer will also be examined.  ***
