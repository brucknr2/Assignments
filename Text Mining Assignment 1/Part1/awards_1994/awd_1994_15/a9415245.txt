Abstract    :
              Abstract  Nunez Community College - S. Chalona  Connection to NSFNET  Proposal
              No.  NCR-9415245  Nunez request support from NSF for connection of their campus
               networks to LaChen and from there to SURAnet.  SURAnet is the  midlevel
              network located in the southeastern United States.  It  will provide operations
              management and information services and it  will give  Nunez Community College
              a 56 thousand bits per second  connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45
              million bits per  second) National Backbone network.    The College needs
              greater functionality and network speed to be  able to access supercomputers,
              libraries, and make file transfers  along with being able to implement a more
              reliable mail system.   Students and faculty research will benefit from the
              link.  This is  also a unique opportunity for the schools to explore innovative
               educational resources.
