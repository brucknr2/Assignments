Abstract    :
              9415507  Uman    The objective of the proposed research is an improvement in the
               presently existing knowledge of the physical processes comprising  the
              lightning discharge with emphasis on the least well understood  processes of
              lightning initiation in the cloud and lightning  attachment to ground.  The
              project includes both experimental and  theoretical studies of natural and
              artificially initiated (rocket-  triggered) lightning flashes.  The latter part
              of 1994 will be  primarily devoted to the analysis of the presently in-hand
              unique  triggered-lightning data (currents, multiple-station electric and 
              magnetic fields, and optical records) acquired in 1993 in Florida  and Alabama.
               During 1995 and 1996 the research will be primarily  concentrated on building
              two relatively large data bases:  (1)  extremely close measurements of electric
              and magnetic fields (in  conjunction with simultaneous current and optical
              records obtained  by cooperating research groups) of the rocket-triggered
              lightning  at Camp Blanding, Florida and Fort McClellan, Alabama and (2) 
              electric and magnetic field records of both cloud-to-ground and in-  cloud
              natural lightning acquired with a state-of-the-art digitizing  system.  The
              year 1997 will be devoted primarily to the analysis of  the newly acquired data
              and associated theoretical studies  concentrating on the least understood
              processes that occur inside  the cloud and during the lightning attachment to
              ground.  The  development of a new theory of the lightning discharge to ground 
              taking into account the lightning attachment processes a will be  attempted.
