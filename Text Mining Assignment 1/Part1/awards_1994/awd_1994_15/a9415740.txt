Abstract    :
              Using Chesapeake Bay as a study site, the proposed research  will evaluate how
              spatial/temporal heterogeneity in physical  and biological habitats interact to
              affect predator-prey  interactions, fish growth rate and system production. 
              Fish  growth rate potential is a new concept that will be  incorporated into
              the models for the first time.  The  research will develop the growth rate
              potential  mathematically, evaluate the sensitivity and spatial  statistics of
              fish growth rate potential relative to the  underlying physical and biological
              structure of habitat,  compare properties of spatially-explicit fish growth
              rate  among different cohorts and species with respect to predator  behavior,
              foraging efficiency and spatial scale of  observation, and develop a dynamic
              spatial model that allows  exchange between different segments of the model. 
              The  Chesapeake Bay will be used as a study site because of the  availability
              of an extensive database well-suited for these  analyses.  The research will
              link biology and physics within  a spatially-explicit framework and has
              widespread  application for predicting how changes in the patterning or 
              absolute scaling of the environment might affect production  dynamics of higher
              trophic levels.
