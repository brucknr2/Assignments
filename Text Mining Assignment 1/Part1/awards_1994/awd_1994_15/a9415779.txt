Abstract    :
              This proposal will deploy the Aerospace CCD camera to make spectral 
              measurements of the temperature and intensity of the OH Meinel and  O2 band
              emissions.  The instrument will also produce the bands'  images, which will be
              used for studying the two dimensional  horizontal wave number spectrum of
              atmospheric gravity waves, and  the frequency of breaking gravity waves.  In
              addition, these data  will be used in conjunction with the colocated lidar or
              radar  instruments to completely characterize the spectral properties of  all
              observed waves.  Finally, the investigator will analyze data  obtained in the
              ALOHA-93 campaign during the first year of this  project.
