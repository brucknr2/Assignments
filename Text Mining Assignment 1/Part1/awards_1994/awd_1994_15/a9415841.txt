Abstract    :
              This research continues efforts to apply advanced interference  spectroscopic
              methods for studies in aeronomy.  The study  emphasizes applications that take
              advantage of the improved  sensitivity of a CCD detector with double and triple
              etalon  systems.  These include geocoronal Balmer-alpha nightglow and  (OI)6300
              dayglow measurements.  A primary goal is the full  validation of our daysky
              measurements.  The system will be moved to  the optical facility at Millstone
              Hill in Massachusetts where  measurements will routinely be coordinated and
              compared with other  optical and radar measurements.  Other measurements
              planned will  extend the long baseline of geocoronal Balmer-alpha intensity 
              measurements for the purpose of studying solar cycle variations and  the
              predicted variation of exospheric hydrogen with lower  atmosphere methane
              buildup.
