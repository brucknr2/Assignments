Abstract    :
              9415609  Miller    This two-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative 
              research in marine biology between Richard L. Miller of  Temple University and
              Jacky Cosson of the Marine Biology  Center, Villefranche Sur Mer, France.  The
              objective of  their research is the study of fertilization patterns and 
              behavior in marine invertebrates. They will perform a  detailed study of salps,
              which are found in abundance in  warm-temperate to tropical waters. Their
              existence in huge  swarms makes them important in the economy of the ocean. 
              The project addresses ways to improve the chances of  fertilization and will
              provide important information about  coordination of reproduction in salps and
              other zooplankton.    Dr. Miller brings to this collaboration extensive
              expertise  in marine biology.  He has wide experience in studies of 
              fertilization of marine invertebrates. This is complemented  by the French
              investigator's expertise in biophysics and  molecular biology and in flagellar
              behaviors of protozoa.  The project will advance understanding of fertilization
               behavior in primitive invertebrates that can be used as a  model for future
              investigations of similar problems in  marine vertebrates.    ***
