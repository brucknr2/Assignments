Abstract    :
              St. Norbert College, a liberal arts institution established in 1891, is the 
              recipient of ARI funds to renovate John Minahan Science Hall, a 27 year old 
              facility, to improve research space for the Division of Natural Sciences.  
              Students engage in original research, learn to use sophisticated equipment, 
              and author papers and present results at professional conferences.  Active 
              learning and research training in environmental science, biology, chemistry, 
              and geology, and independent and collaborative senior thesis projects,  mandate
              efficient use of laboratory space and the college is committed in 
              accommodating this type of space.  Existing research and research training, 
              and support space will be reconfigured, providing greater opportunities for 
              students to  conduct research on a daily basis.  Once renovations are 
              completed, dedicated laboratory space will support research training in 
              ichthyology, environmental chemistry and measurements, ecology,  limnology and
              hydrology.  This award will enable the Division to increase its  ability to
              conduct quality research and research training and to attract  additional
              faculty and students.  An enhanced facility will help students  appreciate and
              understand the scientific process.  The College is committed to  science
              education, which cannot be obtained without an integral research  component. 
              St. Norbert's goal is to continue to train scientists of the highest  caliber
              for the 21st century.
