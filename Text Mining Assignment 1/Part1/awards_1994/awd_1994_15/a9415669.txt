                9415669  Burton                            PROJECT ABSTRACT         The
              overall research objective of the proposed study is  to determine the genetic
              structure of natural populations of  two congeneric species of temperate water
              sea urchins: (1)  the purple urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, and (2) 
              the red urchin, S. franciscanus.  In addition to the  population genetic
              survey, the study will determine size-  specific allozyme frequencies in
              several populations of sea  urchins sampled three times over an eighteen month
              period in  order to asses contemporary levels of interpopulation gene  flow. 
              The research seeks to fill two important questions in  the understanding of the
              population structure of marine  invertebrates: 1)  To what extent are
              biogeographic  boundaries reflected in the genetic structure of species  which
              span the boundaries?  and  2) Are patterns of genetic  differentiation best
              explained by impediments of gene flow  among specific populations, by ongoing
              natural selection, or  by some combination of these processes?  Analysis of
              sources  of recruits to local populations and the viability of  immigrants
              moving between populations is poorly understood  in most marine populations. 
              Yet such an understanding is  essential to the effective management of marine
              biotic  resources.  The data from this study will be used to  initiate an
              intensive population genetic analysis required  to address the issues mentioned
              above.  Such analyses are  especially timely in the case of the red urchin,
              which  currently faces intense predation pressure over much of the  California
              Coast - from sea otters in central California and  from human fishing
              activities in other regions.  S.  franciscanus now supports one of the most
              valuable  invertebrate fisheries on the California coast.
