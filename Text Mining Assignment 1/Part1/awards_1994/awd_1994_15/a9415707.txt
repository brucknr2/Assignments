Abstract    :
              This project uses data from digital ionosondes (digisonde) in Puerto Rico and
              Argentina in order to study how  ionospheric properties in the two hemispheres
              are coupled along magnetic field lines.  The measured critical  frequencies and
              peak heights of the F region will be used in conjunction with a model to
              calculate plasma densities,  temperatures, and ion velocities along the entire
              magnetic flux tube.  The measurements will be coordinated with  observations
              made by the Arecibo incoherent scatter radar and will be an important element
              of an experimental  campaign to study mid-latitude spread F at solar minimum
              and the plasma instabilities associated with sporadic E  layers.  The data will
              be used to estimate conductivities which can be used to determine the control
              exerted in each  hemisphere on the local F region dynamo behavior.  The
              digisonde technique offers the possibility for low cost  monitoring of global
              electron density and plasma drifts.
