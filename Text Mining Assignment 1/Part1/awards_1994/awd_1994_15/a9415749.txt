Abstract    :
              9415749  Belles  Georgian Court College requests support from NSF for connection
               of its campus network to JVNCnet.  JVNCnet is the midlevel  network located in
              the state of New Jersey and it will provide  operations management and
              information services and will give  Georgian Court College a connection to the
              NSFNET, a high speed  (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone
              network.    The College needs greater functionality and network speed to be 
              able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers  along with
              being able to implement a more reliable mail system.  Students and faculty
              research will benefit from the link.  This  is also a unique opportunity for
              the school to explore innovative  educational resources.
