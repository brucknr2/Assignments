Abstract    :
              This is a project to conduct an experimental campaign called CARMEN to study
              ionospheric structure and dynamics  in the Caribbean.  This 15 to 18 month long
              intensive study will use data obtained with optical and radar instruments  at
              Arecibo, Puerto Rico, in addition to a digital ionosonde at the conjugate point
              in Argentina.  The earth s  ionosphere is characterized by a variety of
              storm-like processes that result in a very structured medium.  These 
              structures severely affect the propagation of radio signals from satellites to
              the ground and can disrupt civilian and  military communications and
              positioning systems.  The ultimate goal of this study is to understand the
              processes  that lead to ionospheric irregularities during solar minimum
              conditions.  Collaborators from many different  institutions will participate
              in the campaign and students will be supported at both Cornell and the
              University of  Puerto Rico at Mayaguez.
