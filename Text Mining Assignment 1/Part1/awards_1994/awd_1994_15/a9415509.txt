Abstract    :
              9401559  Hogg    The analysis and interpretation of the current meter and float
              data collected during the Deep basin Experiment (DBE) will be completed in
              conjunction with other DBE investigators. The main emphasis of this component
              is to quantify the deep circulation, especially the flow of Antarctic
              Intermediate Water within an abyssal basin, the Brazil basin, to understand how
              passages affect that flow of water and to distinguish between boundary and
              internal mixing processes in channel like the Vema Channel. Finally,  a
              synthesis of all the observations will be made with an inverse model.
