Abstract    :
              9415327  Shaw    Partial travel support is provided to 12 speakers at the "Joint
              NSF-NIST Conference  on Ultrafine Particle Engineering" to be held on May
              26-27, 1994, at NSF.  The  purpose of the meeting is to bring together NSF and
              NIST grantees, as well as  researchers and managers from industry involved in
              collaborative projects, to review  the  results of the NSF initiative worth the
              same name, promote collaborations among  academic, NIST and industrial
              researchers, and review future research needs.  The  main topics of the meeting
              will be production of nano-sized particles, their  characterization, and
              applications.  The Conference will be organized into four parts:   Synthesis of
              Ultrafine Particles; Characterization of  Nanometer-scale Particulate 
              Materials; Industrial Perspective; and Future Research tends and Opportunities
              for  Collaborative Projects.  This is a timely meeting to evaluate the results
              of the  ENG/NSF initiative on Ultrafine Particle Engineering started in 1991,
              the opportunities  created at NIST by increased funding in this field is FY94,
              and new NSF and NIST  initiatives for collaboration with industry.  The
              proceedings will be published.  ***
