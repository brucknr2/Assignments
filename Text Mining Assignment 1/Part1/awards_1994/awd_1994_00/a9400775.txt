Abstract    :
              9400775  Seider       The award is for better control of the Czochralski 
              crystallization process so that larger diameter wafers of silicon  and other
              compound semiconductors can be grown with fewer defects.   The effort will
              concentrate on development of better reduced-order  models which take into
              account resistances across boundary layers.   Sensors will also be developed to
              measure temperatures at the  crucible wall and to measure atomic oxygen
              concentrations in the  crystal.  Finally, model-predictive controllers will be
              developed  to achieve better control of the crystal growth process.  
              Experiments will be conducted at the site of the industrial partner  to
              validate the researched refinements in modeling, sensor  development, and
              controller development.       Improved control of the Czochralski
              crystallization process is  expected to lead to the ability to grow larger
              diameter crystals of  silicon and other compound semiconductor materials with
              fewer  defects, which would be of value to the semiconductor industry.  
              Furthermore, the sensor developments are expected to result in  better
              understanding of the crystal growth process.  The reduced  order model
              development work is expected to be of value in modeling  a variety of materials
              processing applications involving melt  processing for purposes of control.
