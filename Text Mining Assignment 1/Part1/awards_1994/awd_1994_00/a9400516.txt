Abstract    :
                The ultimate objective of the proposed research is to develop an  improved
              model of the ionospheric electric potentials in the polar  cap.  The initial
              step will be to determine the locations of the  convection boundaries, and how
              the electric potential is  distributed around the perimeter of the
              convection/electric field  reversal boundaries under different orientations of
              the IMF and two  categories of geomagnetic activity.  Solving this problem is 
              perceived to be the most critical step towards  the development of  a better
              model of ionospheric plasma convection.  Measurements from  the Vector Electric
              Field Instrument on DE-2 will be used to obtain  a data base of boundary
              locations and electric potentials around  the boundaries.  The data will be
              sorted according to IMF  orientation and substorm activity, then an innovative
              but proven  method of fitting the data will be used to determine the locations 
              of the convection boundaries and potential distribution as a  function of
              magnetic local time.  These measurements will next be  used as the initial
              boundary conditions for numerical calculations,  to produce reasonable models
              of ionospheric electric potentials.   The results of this project will be
              needed to check the results of  the GEM Program's global geospace general
              circulation model (GGCM),  and could be useful in the development of the GGCM
              code.  The  proposed research will also help to obtain the objectives of the 
              GEM program's substorm campaign.
