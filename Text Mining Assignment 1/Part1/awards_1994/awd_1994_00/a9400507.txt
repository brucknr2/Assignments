Abstract    :
              9400507  Mikkola    This research is aimed at understanding the mechanical
              properties  of  cubic  forms of trialuminides.  The work focuses  on  various 
              cubic  aluminum-titanium-chromium and aluminum-titanium-manganese  alloys, 
              though it is expected that the results will be important  to  the 
              understanding  of  other alloys  having  the  cubic  L12  structure. These
              chromium and manganese ternary alloys have  many  desirable  properties, but
              are unusual in that,  while  they  are  relatively  soft  and have little
              tensile ductility,  failing  by  transgranular fracture.  Similar behavior can
              be found among some  other  potentially useful intermetallics.  The primary
              thrust  of  the  research  is  to  improve these  alloys  through  additional 
              alloying,  based  in large part on studies of the micromechanisms  of  plastic
              deformation by high resolution transmission  electron  microscopy.  In this
              approach weak-beam imaging is combined  with  computer  simulation  of  images
              and related  to  the  mechanical  behavior  of  the  alloys  as  a  function 
              of  temperature   and  composition.   It is the intent of this research to 
              define  this  behavior in the cubic trialiminides, thereby sorting out the wide
               variety  of  conflicting ideas and interpretations found  in  the  literature.
               Specific details of interest include the  nature  of  the  superdislocation
              configurations and dissociation  mechanisms  and  how  these  change  with
              temperature and  composition;  and,  further,  how these changes determine the
              mechanical  properties,  including ductility, work hardening rates, and the
              occurrence  of  serrated stress-strain behavior.  %%%  It is expected that this
              research will lead to improvement of the  properties  and engineering potential
              of the cubic trialuminides.  Effective  modeling of the deformation behavior
              should contribute  in a meaningful way to the future of intelligent alloy
              design.  ***
