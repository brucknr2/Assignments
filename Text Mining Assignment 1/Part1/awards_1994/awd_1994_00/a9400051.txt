Abstract    :
              9400051  Kuo   This grant provides support for research on microelectronic
              circuit design for reliability by means of system burn-in, which can remove
              many of the residual defects remaining after component and subsystem burn-in. 
              Burn-in techniques are widely applied to integrated circuits (ICs) to enhance
              reliability.  However, complex system configurations often make it difficult to
              formulate optimal burn-in strategies.  This research will address the use of a
              non-parametric design approach and the generalized Dirichlet process to
              determine system burn-time.  In addition, it will consider the impact of
              incompatibility that reduces system reliability and that affects the optimal
              burn-in strategy for both component and subsystem burn-in.   If successful,
              this research will provide an approach, at the design stage, for system
              designers to (1) determine the optimal burn-in strategy for new ICs, (2) find
              the optimal burn-in times at the component, subsystem, and system levels, (3)
              implement the optimal burn-in strategy by using the field failure data
              available from IC manufacturers, and (4) better understand the failure
              mechanisms of new ICs, enabling improvement of their reliability and quality in
              the manufacturing process.  These advances could help to improve
              competitiveness of the United States IC industry.
