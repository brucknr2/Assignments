Abstract    :
              9400328  Gevelber       The award is for research directed at improving the
              ability to  fabricate engineered coatings through the development of a real- 
              time control system for chemical vapor deposition.  Such coatings  are
              currently used to improve surface properties such as thermal  shock resistance,
              corrosion, wear, and oxidation resistance.  Real  time measurement of the
              growth process is the basis for improved  control of the coating morphology. 
              The current practice of  maintaining process input variables such as gas flow
              rates and  temperatures at empirically determined setpoints does not ensure 
              achievement of the desired morphology and requires extensive trial  and error
              each time the equipment or the process is changed.  The  proposal research
              involves modeling the nucleation/growth kinetics,  designing and implementing
              an appropriate control structure in-situ  sensors, and experimental
              verification of the approach.       The work is expected to result in expanded
              processing  capabilities in chemical vapor deposition coating applications in 
              the aerospace and machine tooling industries.  The work is also  likely to
              benefit a broader variety of advanced materials  processing technologies by
              formulating a methodology for better  closed loop control of such process.
