Abstract    :
              This project has as a goal the mathematically rigorous  construction and study
              of quantum field theory models.  This would be an aid to the understanding of
              elementary  particle physics, ultimately predicting particle  masses,
              scattering amplitudes, and so forth.  It would  also help in the study of some
              properties of many body  systems, particularly critical phenomena.  Specific 
              models to be studied are the following.  (1.) The Sine-  Gordon model in 2
              dimensions.  This is a scalar field  with a periodic interaction.  It also 
              describes a  classical Coulomb gas.  (2.) phi-fourth models in 3 and  4
              dimensions.  These are scalar fields with a quartic  self-interaction.  (3.)
              Quantum electrodynamics in 3  dimensions.  This is the theory of electrons and 
              photons.  (4.) Yang Mills in 3 and 4 dimensions.  This  is a pure non-  Abelian
              gauge theory.
