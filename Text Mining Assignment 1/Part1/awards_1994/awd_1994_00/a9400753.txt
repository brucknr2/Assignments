Abstract    :
              9400753   Cutkosky       The principle investigator will investigate four
              problems in  algebraic geometry.  He will work on the Riemann-Roch problem 
              which is to compute the cohomology groups of high multiples of a  line bundle
              on a projective variety.  He will also work on the  local analogue of this
              problem which is the computation of  Hilbert functions of valuation ideals
              determined by vanishing to  high multiplicity along fixed valuations.  In
              addition, the  principle investigator will study ramification and the 
              equivalence of homomorphisms of modules.                This research is
              concerned with a number of questions in  commutative algebra and algebraic
              geometry.  Algebraic geometry  studies solutions of families of polynomial
              equations.  One can  either study the geometry of the solution set or approach 
              problems algebraically by investigating certain functions on the  solution set
              that form what is called a commutative ring.  This  dual perspective creates a
              close connection between commutative  algebra and algebraic geometry.
