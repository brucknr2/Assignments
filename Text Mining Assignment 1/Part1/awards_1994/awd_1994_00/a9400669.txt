Abstract    :
              Hargraves  9400669   With scientific, political and public concern about effects
              of coastal pollution and global climate change on marine species biodiversity,
              there is an urgent need for accurate identification of phytoplakton.  Currently
              used manuals for identification of plankton diatoms of the northeast U.S. coast
              are inadequate to fill this need for several reasons:  outdated taxonomy;
              inadequate inclusiveness of taxa; insufficient descriptors and/or
              illustrations; and limited geographic applicability.  This research will permit
              completion of an identification manual for plankton diatoms, to include general
              aspects of diatom biology (habit, ecology, life cycles, morphology,
              biogeography) and a complete flora of and key to verified species (taxonomic
              history, detailed illustrations of morphology, interspecies comparisons and
              regional distribution).  New and recent samples (Bay of Fundy to Chesapeake
              Bay; estuarine to continental shelf) will be collected to supplement an
              existing data base of about 1100 microscope slides and 1600 liquid preserved
              samples.  There is currently no such manual in existence for the northeast
              U.S..  In addition to a printed manual information will be incorporated into
              the Linnaeus computerized identification program.  The data will also be
              entered into a suitable data management system compatible with those at the
              ANSP (Philadelphia) and the CAS (San Francisco), and as much as feasible with
              the ARC/INFO GIS system at the University of Rhode Island.  It is expected that
              the manual and data will be:  usable by non-specialists; stimulating and
              adjunct to a variety of marine biological/oceanographic studies; accessible via
              printed and electronic media; and able to maintain its usefulness on a decadal
              scale.
