Abstract    :
              This research pertains to the participation of the mist chamber  method for
              measuring tropospheric sulfur Dioxide (SO2) in the 1994  NSF-sponsored
              intercomparison (GASIE).  The intercomparison will be  coordinated by the
              University of Delaware, and is tentatively  planned for September and October
              of 1994 in Lewes, Delaware.  Two  researcher from the University of New
              Hampshire will operate the  mist chamber method during the GASIE
              intercomparison.  The mist  chamber method appears desirable for field
              deployment in  atmospheric chemistry measurement programs in remote regions 
              because it is quite sensitive  a detection limit of approximately  20 pptr (v)
              , appears to be free from matrix interferences is  relatively small in size and
              weight, plus offers modest  implementation costs.  The reliability of the mist
              chamber method  for  measuring SO2 will be further tested by participation in
              the  rigorous double-blind GASIE intercomparison.  This participation is  an
              essential next step in the validation of the method prior to its  future use in
              large field measurement programs.
