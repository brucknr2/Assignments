Abstract    :
              This award provides funding for developing a new technology, called  Thermosonic
              Bonding, for connections in electronic packaging  applications.  Such a
              technology and the knowledge base resulting  from the studies will have a
              profound impact on solderless  packaging technologies in manufacturing.  The
              resulting  technologies can also be useful to support prototyping facilities 
              and education in manufacturing engineering.  The technology can  simplify the
              prototyping procedures for multichip (MCM) modules.   Such technologies are
              critical to low-cost and environmentally  sound prototyping and manufacturing
              methods.
