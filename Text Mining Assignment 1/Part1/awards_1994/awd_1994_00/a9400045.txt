Abstract    :
              9400045  Krasny  This award provides funds to continue a successful REU SITE at
              Cornell University for  another three years.  The program consists of a
              nine-week Research Experiences for  Undergraduates in the environmental
              sciences for 10 students, half of whom will be from  predominantly minority
              institutions or from institutions serving predominantly disabled  students, and
              half of whom will be from Cornell.  Research projects include Population 
              Structure within the Common Northern Goshawk (Accipiter gentilis atricapillus)
              and putative  Mexican Subspecies (Accipiter gentilis apache), Fish Communities
              and the Conservation of  Aquatic Habitats, Carbon Biogeochemistry in Wetland
              Ecosystems, Biological Control of  Purple Loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria), and
              American Indian Cultural Practices for White  Corn Production in New York.  In
              addition to the individual research projects, students will  be involved in an
              ethics seminar and tutorial, weekly seminars focusing on various aspects of 
              the research process, and teaching research to younger youth.  Students will be
              required to  give slide and poster presentations during the summer and complete
              scientific papers during  the academic year following the program.  ***
