Abstract    :
              9400712  Knoll   Processes of organic decay and fossilization impose strong
              filters on the paleontological record.  Because extraordinarily well-preserved
              fossils retain biological information not commonly available in sedimentary
              rocks, they have played a key role in the interpretation of plant and animal
              evolution.  They are equally important in attempts to understand Precambrian
              life.  I propose a comprehensive systematic, taphonomic, paleoecological, and
              biostratigraphic study of three exceptionally well-preserved fossil assemblages
              that collectively shed significant new light on the early history of eukaryotic
              organisms:  the ca.750 million year old (Ma) Multicolored Series, Greenland;
              the 100-1100 Ma old Ruyang Group, China; and what is among the best preserved
              and most diverse of all Precambrian fossil assemblages, the 600-580 Ma old
              Doushantuo Formation, south China.  Information gathered in these studies will
              contribute to a new data base (DELTA System) of Proterozoic Eukaryotes that
              will simultaneously serve as a taxonomic key and a tool for exploring the
              environmental and age distribution of radiating eukaryotic taxa and characters.
               In a practical vein, these data will contribute to a growing biostratigraphic
              and paleoenvironmental framework that is proving valuable in rapidly expanding
              exploration for Neoproterozoic resources.
