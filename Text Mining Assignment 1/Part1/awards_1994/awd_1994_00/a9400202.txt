Abstract    :
              9400202  Shemansky         The PIs propose to examine theory for the
              consequences of the  encounter of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 with the Jupiter
              system.  The  purpose is twofold:  (1) the Jupiter environment may provide a 
              unique insight into the composition, structure and physical  chemistry of SL9
              through the expected enhanced extraction of the  atomic and molecular
              components of the solid into the magnetosphere  through sputtering and
              desorption in the inner and outer regions,  and heating of the grains in the Io
              torus, and (2) the transient  introduced into the magnetosphere may be strong
              enough to allow an  unprecedented exploration of the intrinsic source and
              diffusive  loss processes controlling the undisturbed planetary system.  
              Predictive abilities include established model codes that are  utilized to
              calculate the detailed emission properties of atomic  and molecular species
              excited by physical chemistry as well as the  combined direct processes of
              electron and photon excitation.  ***
