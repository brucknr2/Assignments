Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9400737  R. J. Phillips    It is proposed to investigate the
              effect of non-newtonian fluids on the interactions between suspended particles,
              and on the macroscopic behavior of the suspensions.  Flow modeling will
              consider second-order fluid constitutive relationships as a limit case for
              viscoelastic fluids.  More realistic constitutive relationships will be
              introduced later in analysis.  Stokesian dynamics simulations will be performed
              with multi-sphere systems in weakly viscoelastic fluids.  The computational
              results will be compared to measurements on particle concentration in the
              sedimentation and diffusion experiments, which will be performed with a
              holographic interferometer and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging.    The
              proposed project has relevance to the fabrication of homogeneous composite
              materials and coatings, particularly from polymeric materials having particles
              in suspension.  ***
