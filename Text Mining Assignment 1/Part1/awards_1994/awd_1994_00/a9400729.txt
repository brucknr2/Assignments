Abstract    :
              9400729  Qin       Since the fundamental work of Simon Donaldson about a decade 
              ago, gauge theory has been very sucessfully applied to study  smooth
              4-manifolds, especially complex surfaces.  The main  concern of this project is
              to study the interplay between the  complex geometry and the differential
              topology of complex  surfaces, by utilizing smooth invariants introduced by
              Simon  Donaldson and Dieter Kotschick, by investigating stable vector  bundles
              and their moduli spaces on complex surfaces, and by using  recent work of Jun
              Li and Robert Friedman.  In particular, the  investigator wishes to study
              Donaldson invariants for simply  connected algebraic surfaces with trivial
              geometric genus  (including the complex projective plane).       This project
              is in the field of gauge theory, which  interacts heavily with other areas of
              mathematics such as  topology, algebraic geometry, and even mathematical
              physics.   Progress could take many different forms.  Surprisingly, recent 
              work in supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory by some physicists  (notably Edward
              Witten) has led to many mathematical insights in  the differential topology of
              complex surfaces.  Quite possibly, a  deeper understanding of some of the
              algebraic geometry and  algebraic topology at issue in this project will in
              turn shed  light on problems of concern to the community of quantum 
              physicists.  ***
