Abstract    :
              Professor Todorov will work on the geometry and topology of  Calabi-Yau
              manifolds and K3 surfaces. In particular he wants to  work on the Teichmuller
              theory and the analytic discriminant of  Calabi-Yau manifolds. He also wants to
              study the Krotweg de Vries  equation.  This is research in the field of
              algebraic geometry, yet it  directly connects to two of the great advances in
              theoretical  physics in this century--quantum mechanics and general 
              relativity. Algebraic geometry itself is one of the oldest parts  of modern
              mathematics, but one which has had a revolutionary  flowering in the past
              quarter-century. In its origin, it treated  figures that could be defined in
              the plane by the simplest  equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field
              makes use of  methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and topology, 
              and conversely is finding application in those fields as well as  in physics,
              theoretical computer science, and robotics.
