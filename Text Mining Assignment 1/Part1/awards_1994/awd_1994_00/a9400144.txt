Abstract    :
              This project is the investigation of the redistribution of sediment and
              pollutants over the Arctic  basin through transport by sea ice, a heretofore
              neglected aspect of the depositional history of  the arctic sea ice and ocean
              bottom.  It will focus on the reconstruction of sediment and pollutant 
              incorporation mechanisms, as well as the origin, development, and transport
              history of individual  floes.    The study will concentrate on the Beaufort
              Gyre, where the ice is relatively old, and where  individual floes may have
              significantly different histories.  Multiple variables that include the 
              physical properties of the sea ice and the sediments, the contaminant
              chemistry, and the isotopic  oxygen analysis, will be combined in an analysis
              for the origin, development, and transport  history of sea ice in the Amerasian
              Basin.  The work can potentially develop techniques for  distinguishing on the
              basis of the combined indicators between ice formed in the Canadian or 
              Siberian sectors of the Arctic Ocean, and provide information on such questions
              as how widely  distributed is ice with an apparent river signal (relative
              depletion of oxygen-18), and does it tend  to have greater contaminant loads.
