Abstract    :
              9400199  Brawley    This three-year award supports U.S.-Sweden cooperative
              research  in marine biology. Researchers, undergraduates and graduate  students
              at the University of Maine, Stockholm University and  University of Umea will
              conduct field and laboratory studies on  how marine organisms adapt to and
              invade freshwater habitats over  evolutionary time scales. By studying
              organisms in low-salinity  habitats, the investigators propose to extend their
              findings to  freshwater habitats.  The Baltic Sea is an ideal site because it 
              is the largest body of brackish water on Earth and has an  extensive and
              well-known post-glacial history.  Fucus  vesiculosus, a fucoid algae found in
              abundance in the Baltic, is  the focus of the study.  It has adapted gradually
              to brackish  waters and serves as an important spawning and nursery ground for 
              marine organisms including some economically important fish.    The project
              takes advantage of complementary expertise of U.S.  investigator, Susan
              Brawley, and her Swedish counterparts, Lena  Kautsky and Goran Samuelsson. Dr.
              Brawley brings to this  collaboration expertise in biology, physiology and
              genetics of  seaweeds.  This is complemented by Swedish knowledge in ecology 
              and ecotoxicology.  The research will advance understanding of  the
              geographical distribution, speciation and evolution of marine  seaweeds,
              particularly a species which is currently threatened by  pollution.  ***
