Abstract    :
              Mijovic  This research is on molecular and phenomenological aspects of 
              dielectric properties of reactive systems in the frequency domain  of the
              dipole relaxation process.  The work concerns both  monofunctional (non-polymer
              forming reactants) and multifunctional  or polymer forming reactants.  The
              unique feature of the  investigation is that it will probe the exact molecular
              make-up of  the reactive system, where the molecular probe is the dipole itself
               and the response is measured in real time.  The analysis is based  upon the
              premise that the dielectric response in the course of  reaction must reflect a
              change in the type and concentration of  dipoles and a decrease in their
              mobility.  Reorientational dynamics  of dipoles will be experimentally
              determined as a function of  reaction time and temperature over a wide
              frequency range that will  always include the major relaxation process.  The
              observed  dielectric behavior will be checked against model predictions.  For 
              the monofunctional reactive formulation, we shall seek to establish 
              correlations between the dielectric properties and the known  mechanistic
              kinetics.  Modelling of the multifunctional polymer  forming system will be
              based upon the fundamental correlation  between the frequency-dependent
              dielectric constant and its time-  dependent counterpart, which will be
              appropriately modified to  account for the distribution of relaxation times in
              reactive  polymers.  %%%  This fundamental research is of utility in the
              preparation of  polymer-matrix composites in that it will allow a better
              control of  the chemical reactions in their manufacture.
