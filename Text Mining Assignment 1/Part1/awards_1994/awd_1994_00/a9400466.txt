Abstract    :
              9400466 Zelmanov       This award supports research on several problems
              concerning  finite p-groups, pro-p groups, and infinite dimensional Lie 
              algebras.  All these problems are related to algebras satisfying  a polynomial
              identity, to Lie algebras with Engel's condition and  to coordinatization
              theorems.       This research is concerned with a mathematical object called  a
              Lie algebra.  Lie algebras arise from another object called a  Lie group.  An
              example of a Lie group is the rotations of a  sphere where one rotation is
              followed by another.  Lie groups and  Lie algebras are important in areas
              involving analysis of  spherical motion.
