Abstract    :
              This award supports research in algebraic geometry.  There are  two objectives
              of the project.  The first is to obtain universal  realtions for the values of
              Donaldson polynomials on classes of  algebraic curvs of arbitrary genus and
              self-intersection.  The  second is to understand global properties of moduli
              spaces of  bector bundles on surfaces.             The research is in the field
              of algebraic geometry, one of the  oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one
              which blossomed to  the point where it has, in the past ten years, solved
              problems  that have stood for centuries.  Originally, it treated figures 
              defined in the plane by the simplest of equations, namely  polynomials.  Today,
              the field uses methods not only from  algebra, but also from analysis and
              topology, and conversely it  is extensively used in those fields.  Moreover it
              has proved  itself useful in fields as diverse as physics, theoretical 
              computer science, cryptography, coding theory and robotics.
