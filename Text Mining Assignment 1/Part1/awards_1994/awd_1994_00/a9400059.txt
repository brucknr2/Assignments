Abstract    :
              9400059  Auchincloss       This program will enable sophomore and juniors from 
              Rochester area institutions to undertake supervised projects in  experimental
              particle physics and quantum optics at University of  Rochester.  Upon
              acceptance to the program, students gain  familiarity with their respective
              research groups and  laboratories through part-time work during the spring
              semester.  The central experience takes place during the summer 2.5-month 
              full-time work period.  Each student will then continue part-time  involvement
              during the following fall and spring semesters, with  the aim of completing a
              scientific publication or report for  presentation at the spring Rochester
              Symposium for Physics  Students, hosted annually by the Department of Physics
              and  Astronomy.       The program has been designed to integrate well with
              other  University initiatives toward increasing and enhancing the 
              participation of underrepresented groups in science.  Five of the  10 student
              positions will be reserved for women and minority  students.  As the ethics
              component of this program, a series of  seminars is planned in which University
              and outside scholars will  speak on historical and current issues at the
              intersections  science, gender, race and ethics.  The scope of this series and 
              the broad interpretation of "ethics" is intended have relevance  to a diverse
              group of student researchers, and to promote  discussion of the tensions, in
              social as well as scientific  values, that confront scientists in the present
              era.  ***
