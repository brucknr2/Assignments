Abstract    :
              9400912  Nirenberg       This award supports mathematical research on problems 
              arising in the field of nonlinear partial differential equations.   They
              include second order elliptic equations in general domains  in Euclidean
              n-dimensional space as well as on manifolds.  Regularity conditions will not be
              assumed and the differential  operators are not necessarily self-adjoint. Other
              work will focus  on free boundary problems, in particular singular limits for 
              nonlinear problems and Liouville-type theorems for application to  nonlinear
              boundary value problems.   A second line of  investigation involves statistical
              mechanics for wave equations.   Specifically, statistical/mechanical
              probabilistic methods will  be employed to study classical and non-classical
              nonlinear waves.   A new (integrable) shallow water equation which has
              interesting  connections with geodesic flow on creased manifolds of otherwise 
              constant curvature.       Partial differential equations form a basis for
              mathematical  modeling of the physical world.  The role of mathematical 
              analysis is not so much to create the equations as it is to  provide
              qualitative and quantitative information about the  solutions.  This may
              include answers to questions about  uniqueness, smoothness and growth.  In
              addition, analysis often  develops methods for approximation of solutions and
              estimates on  the accuracy of these approximations.  ***
