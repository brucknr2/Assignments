Abstract    :
              9400526  Madix  The determination of the relationship between the spatial 
              organization of adsorbed layers and the kinetic description of  their
              reactivity is the goal of this research project supported  by the Analytical
              and Surface Chemistry Program.  Temperature  dependent scanning tunneling
              microscopy will be used to  isolate, stabilize and image reaction
              intermediates.  This  structural information will then be correlated with
              kinetic  studies of these reactions, using thermal desorption  spectroscopy as
              the primary probe of reaction kinetics.  Several reaction systems will be
              investigated, including the  oxidation of Cu(110), the desorption of oxygen
              from Pt(100),  the formation of carbonate on Ag(110), and the decomposition of 
              formates and alkoxides on copper surfaces.  Each of these  systems either shows
              unusual reaction kinetics or evidence of  interesting structural variations in
              the reacting overlayers.  %%%  The connection between overlayer ordering and
              kinetic processes  in surface reactions is a relatively unexplored area of
              surface  chemistry.  The work of this project will impact on our  understanding
              of the connection between overlayer ordering and  surface reactivity, and may
              have important implications for  reactions in organized media well beyond the
              individual surface  reactions to be studied.  ***
