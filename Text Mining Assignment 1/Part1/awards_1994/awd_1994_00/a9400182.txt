              will provide partial support for the 1994 "International  Conference on Tree
              Rings, Environment, and Humanity; Relationships  and Processes" which will be
              held in Tucson, Arizona, on 17-21 May  1994, and will be hosted by the
              Laboratory of Tree Ring Research at  the University of Arizona.  The conference
              will offer an  opportunity for professional scholars and students interested in
               tree-ring research to meet and to discuss current progress and  future
              directions of world dendrochronology. The International  Conference will
              feature discussions on the full range of  dendrochronological applications and
              techniques including  paleoclimatology and global change.  The theme of the
              conference,  stresses the application of tree-ring research to understanding 
              environmental and cultural processes.  The conference will address  aspects of
              the past and future Earth, including its physical,  biological, and social
              systems.
