Abstract    :
                This project develops perturbation techniques for   deriving bounds on the
              relative error of singular values and   eigenvalues,  as well as  bounds on the
              error angles of singular vectors and    eigenvectors in terms of a  relative
              gap.  Deflation and  convergence criteria based on these bounds   have the
              potential to  lead to highly accurate and efficient   QR-type and Jacobi 
              algorithms for computing eigenvalue, singular value and URV    decompositions. 
              In the context of the singular value decomposition of a   matrix B,  a class of
               perturbations is investigated which represents  all possible   that do not
              change the rank of B.  In  particular, it   includes componentwise  relative
              perturbations of  bidiagonal and biacyclic matrices,   and perturbations  that 
              annihilate an offdiagonal block in a block triangular   matrix.  So  far,  many
              existing relative perturbations bounds have been    derived for singular 
              values and vectors of bidiagonal matrices  from general   results for this
              class  of perturbations.   Also, new  perturbation results have been   proved
              for  singular values and  vectors of biacyclic, triangular and   shifted
              triangular  matrices.  These results are extended to the generalized  
              eigenvalue problem, and to the eigenvalue problems for   structured  and 
              non-Hermitian matrices.
