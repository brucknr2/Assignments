Abstract    :
              9400522  Lee  This four-day workshop on mobile subsea robots will be concerned 
              primarily with complete working systems or subsystems and will  emphasize
              experimental results.  Participation will be by  invitation only on the basis
              of extended abstracts or complete  papers.  Participant will be selected by an
              international Program  Committee composed of leading experts in the field.  A
              maximum of  twenty-five papers will be selected for presentation and  inclusion
              in the workshop proceedings.  An IARP forum meeting  will be held preceding the
              workshop.    Topics to be addressed in the workshop include: 1) system 
              architecture, 2) modeling, simulation, and display of operational 
              environments, 3) task and mission planning and execution, 4)  teleoperation and
              communication, 5) sensing and control, and 6)  actuators, propulsion, and
              structures.    In the context of this workshop, the term robot will be taken to
               mean unmanned computer-controlled vehicles operated under human  supervision
              as well as completely autonomous systems.  The term  mobile refers to a system
              able to move from a base to a work site  using its own propulsion system.  With
              this definition, the topic  of this conference excludes fixed-base manipulators
              or sensory  packages and also excludes simple manually-controlled remotely 
              operated vehicles.
