Abstract    :
              9400872  Larusson       The research entails applying elements of function
              theory in  several complex variables combined with Hodge theory to  investigate
              the geometric and convexity properties of covering  spaces of complex
              manifolds. Also, the existence of bounded  holomorphic functions on Riemann
              surfaces with a large group of  automorphisms will be investigated. The
              research has potential  applications to other areas of mathematics including
              algebraic  geometry and number theory.   ***
