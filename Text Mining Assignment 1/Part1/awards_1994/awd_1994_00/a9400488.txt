Abstract    :
              The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center  (MRSEC) at the University
              of Massachusetts at Amherst  supports interactive research in three major
              groups with  emphasis on polymeric and bimolecular materials.    Researchers in
              the group investigating polymers in  restricted geometries seek to understand
              the behavior of  polymers at interfaces and in porous media.  This work is 
              motivated by the critical role of interfacial phenomena in  determining the
              performance of advanced materials.   The  group focusing on biomolecular
              materials aims to develop and  analyze well-defined artificial proteins and
              biodegradable  bacterial storage polyesters.   The group investigating 
              advanced polyolefins and blends proposes to develop new  synthesis and
              processing routes to high performance  materials based on simple olefins such
              as ethylene and  propylene.  This particular work is motivated by the 
              availability of a new generation of catalysts that enables  petroleum
              feedstocks to be converted directly into high  performance materials.    The
              MRSEC supports the development, operation and  maintenance of shared
              experimental facilities for materials  research. It provides seed funding for
              exploratory research  and  fosters research participation by undergraduates. 
              The  MRSEC is associated with an educational outreach program  with special
              emphasis on attracting and keeping women and  underrepresented minorities in
              science.   The Center for  UMass-Industry Research on Polymers (CUMIRP)
              provides  industrial liaison.  The MRSEC currently involves 24 senior 
              investigators,  3 postdoctoral research associates,  3  technical staff
              members,  21 graduate students, and 12  undergraduates.  The MRSEC at the
              University of  Massachusetts at Amherst  is directed by Professor David A. 
              Tirrell.
