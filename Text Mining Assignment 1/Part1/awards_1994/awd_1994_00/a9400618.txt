Abstract    :
              9400618  Asmar       This proposal describes a continuation of collaborative
              work  in multipliers on Lebesgue spaces and maximal operators over a  locally
              compact abelian group. The work leads to dimension-free  estimates for radial
              multipliers such as the Riesz transforms on  Euclidean space. It also continues
              earlier work in transference  theory, this time in connection with the Coifman
              and Weiss  Multiplier Theorem for semi-groups of operators. The joint work 
              with S. Montgomery-Smith on the applications of Brownian motion  is yielding
              new results and showing a unity in the treatment of  maximal and square
              functions in martingale theory, and  harmonic analysis of Banach space valued
              functions on groups with  ordered dual groups. Vectors in n-dimensional
              Euclidean space can  be added and in this way Euclidean space is a commutative
              group.  Classical analysis usually refers to analysis of functions and 
              operators on this commutative group. This project involves  studying analogues
              of classical analysis operators and estimates  in the context of an abstract
              commutative group. This abstract  point of view leads to a unification of large
              areas of analysis.  ***
