Abstract    :
              9400283  FINDLEY  This project will supply shipboard scientific equipment for
              the    research vessels COLUMBUS ISELIN and CALANUS, operated by the    
              University of Miami, Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric   Science, and
              dedicated to use in support of ocean science     research.          The
              Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides funds  for ship
              equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe     conduct of ocean science
              research. This Program provides support   for such items as deck equipment
              including winch systems for the   deployment and retrieval of scientific
              instruments, navigational   equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and earth
              satellite     receivers to pin point the location of research sites,     
              communication equipment including radio transceivers and      satellite
              transceivers for voice and scientific data      communications and other
              equipment such as motorized workboats    for transporting scientists to and
              from data retrieval sites.         The Project Director, Richard Findley is
              fully qualified to     direct this project having had considerable experience
              in     overseeing the acquisition and installation of shipboard     equipment. 
                        This project will allow the institution to acquire a Laboratory  Van,
              a wire lubricating system, a differential GPS, and two  computer terminals and
              replace a worn out autopilot.  ***
