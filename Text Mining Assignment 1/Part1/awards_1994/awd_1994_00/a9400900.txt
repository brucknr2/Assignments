Abstract    :
              9400900  Floyd       Professor Floyd plans to continue a joint research project,
               with Professor J. W. Cannon (of Brigham Young University) and  Professor W.R.
              Parry (of Eastern Michigan University), in  geometric group theory. Their
              research is an attempt to prove the  conjecture that a word hyperbolic group
              with visual sphere at  infinity the 2-sphere acts cocompactly, properly
              discontinuously,  and isometrically on real hyperbolic 3-space.  By a result of
               Cannon-Swenson, proving the conjecture is equivalent to proving  that a
              particular shingling of the visual sphere at infinity is  conformal.  The main
              emphasis of the project is on determining  when a sequence of shinglings of a
              surface is conformal.       An important special case is to understand the 
              intrinsicgeometry of a sequence of tilings given by a finite  subdivision rule.
               As an example of a finite subdivision rule,  consider subdividing a rectangle
              (tile) by dividing it in half  horizontally and into thirds vertically, so as
              to get six smaller  rectangles (subtiles) of equal size.  If one repeats the
              process  inductively on the subtiles, one gets new subtiles which are  becoming
              distorted (tall and narrow).  Understanding whether one  can change the shapes
              so that the subtiles do not become  arbitrarily distorted is at the heart of an
              important problem in  topology and group theory.  The investigators are trying
              to  prove that, in the cases under consideration, there is an  intrinsic
              geometry in which the subtiles do not become distorted.   In some examples, to
              achieve this one changes the shapes of the  tiles so that they have fractal
              boundaries.  ***
