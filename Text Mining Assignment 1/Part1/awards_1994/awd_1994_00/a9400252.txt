Abstract    :
              94-00252  The PI requests funding to purchase a high-frequency, broad-band
              Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) that will be operated as shared use
              equipment for a wide variety of research programs.  The ADCP will be equipped
              with a 600 kHz and 1.2 mHz transducers in order to allow high resolution
              studies of currents in shallow environments.  This equipment will be available
              to researchers at many different institutions, and partial support for the
              instrument will be supplied by the University of Washington, Woods Hole
              Oceanographic Institution, the Marine Biological Laboratory, Scripps Institute
              of Oceanography and Horn Point Environmental Laboratory.  The instrumentation
              requested is required for support of a variety of NSF-funded research projects,
              primarily related to the Land-Margin Ecosystem Research (LMER) programs, and
              will enhance the scientific capability of these institutions in the future.
