Abstract    :
              9400157  Kent   The proposed project is in response to the SKIPJACK initiative
              announced by the White House on April 19, 1993.  The initiative involves both a
              chip for encryption (CLIPPER), to be incorporated into all telecommunications
              equipment, and a key-escrow scheme to ensure privacy of users.  The initiative
              raises a number of serious public policy issues.    This award is to provide
              funds for convening a panel to explore a number of topics under the general
              rubric of cryptography and public policy, as a service both to ACM members and
              to the public at large.  In particular, the "Clipper proposal" and the current
              export control policy applied to cryptography will be analyzed with regard to
              their effectiveness, impact on the global competitiveness of U.S. industry, and
              implications for personal privacy.  The panel will consist of the chair (the
              P.I.), an additional seven members, and a staff member, and will prepare a
              report in six months.    The rationale provided for the use of the SKIPJACK
              algorithm and the associated key escrow scheme, as a Federal Information
              Processing Standard (FIPS), will be examined in detail.  The panel will explore
              the question "What must happen for this initiative to succeed and what might
              cause it to fail?"  The panel will also examine issues related to trade,
              privacy, and technology development.  ***
