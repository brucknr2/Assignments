Abstract    :
              94-00764    The University of Rhode Island (URI) requests renewed funding for
              Year 1 of a three-year continuing grant to support shipboard technician
              activities associated with the research vessel ENDEAVOR.  The ship is a
              177-foot vessel that is owned by the NSF and operated by URI. URI technicians
              will be responsible for operating and repairing instruments while at sea,
              maintaining instruments ashore and assisting with scientific operations as
              necessary before and after cruises.
