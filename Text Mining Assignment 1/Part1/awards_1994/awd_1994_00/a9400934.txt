Abstract    :
              9400934  Haiman    This project involves research into modules associated with
              the  Macdonald polynomials and the module of diagonal harmonics.  The  work
              promises to establish new relationships between these   objects and other parts
              of algebraic combinatorics and algebraic   geometry.  Preliminary work has
              already established the framework  for the connections and has produced
              important new algebraic  identities.        This research falls in the broad
              category of combinatorics,   which is one of the most active fields in today's
              mathematics. At  its roots, combinatorics is the study of systematic counting. 
               Counting can be incredibly difficult when the objects are  difficult to list, 
              and combinatorists look for general methods  for overcoming these difficulties.
               Today's combinatorics makes  use of a wide variety of the most advanced and
              modern  mathematical techniques.  Although its roots go back several 
              centuries, the field has had an explosive development in the past  few decades.
               This growth comes from its importance in  communications and information
              technology and from the success of  modern techniques to problems of counting.
