Abstract    :
              9400097  Grunbaum       This project, which is jointly funded by the Applied
              Mathematics Program,  the Computational Biology Program, and the Computational
              Mathematics Program,  will consider a number of inverse problems motivated by
              problems in biomedical  imaging, including existing modalities such as X-ray
              and magnetic resonance, as  well as emerging ones such as diffuse tomography
              and the use of higher order  invariants in the direct method of   X-ray
              crystallography. Some specific areas of investigation include work on aspects 
              of the limited angle reconstruction problem in X-ray tomography, the design of 
              optimnized pulses for slice selection in magnetic resonance imaging, the 
              development of nonlinear inversion algorithms in diffuse tomography, and the 
              development of new ways of using higher order invariants within the direct
              method  of X-ray crystallography to solve the phase problem.       This
              project, which is jointly funded by the Applied Mathematics Program,  the
              Computational Biology Program, and the Computational Mathematics Program, 
              centers around inverse problems arising in biomedical imaging, including X-ray
              and  magnetic resonance imaging. In particular, it will explore ways in which 
              developments in mathematical physics can yield insights in diffuse tomography, 
              that is, medical imaging using very low energy probes such as infra-red lasers.
               While this research is likely to be of considerable practical value in certain
              specific  areas of medical diagnostics such as mammographies and neonatal
              diagnostics, the  principal ideas and concepts have applicability beyond
              medical imaging, from areas  such as crystallography to radar target estimation
              and semi-conductors.
