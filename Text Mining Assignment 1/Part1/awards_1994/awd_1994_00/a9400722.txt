Abstract    :
              9400722  Hobbie  Freshwater systems are a major feature of the arctic landscape,
               despite the low precipitation, because permafrost prevents  drainage and
              evaporation is low.  Their relative biotic  simplicity offers advantages to
              researchers attempting to sort  out the various controls and interactions of
              arctic lakes and  streams.  An understanding of the ecological processes is a 
              necessary part of the long-term goal of this project:  prediction  of the
              effect of changes in land use and climate on arctic stream  and lake
              ecosystems.  This project will be based at an LTER site,  Toolik Lake, on the
              North Slope of Alaska, and will make use of  long-term experiments of stream
              and lake fertilization and  manipulations of the dominant predator in lakes,
              the lake trout.   These manipulations are maintained by the LTER group.  The 
              project will also use LTER-produced data on basic environmental  conditions
              including climate, lake physics and chemistry,  nutrient concentrations in
              streams and lakes, and stream flow.   The project will move strongly towards
              synthesis and use data  derived from all the past studies plus data from recent
               manipulations on streams and lakes.  The long-term goal of the  synthesis and
              modeling is to understand the movements and  transformations of water,
              nutrients, and organic matter through  an entire watershed in the high Arctic.
