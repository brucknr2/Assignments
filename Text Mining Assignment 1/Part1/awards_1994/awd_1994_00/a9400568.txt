               Revision Problems:  A Tool for Programming Knowledge Base  Transformations    
                  This is the first year funding of a three-year continuing  award.  This
              research project is  to develop a new logic-based  approach to handle the
              effects of change in knowledge bases.  It is  domain independent, so it could
              be an important tool for people  working in logic-based knowledge
              representations.  It addresses  important questions that any knowledge
              representation must address  analogously. The system of revision programs
              significantly extends  logic programming with stable model semantics.  Revision
              programs  are treated as input/output devices (drawing from the experience of 
              DATALOG).  As such, revision programs allow relation of (unknown)  causes to
              (observable) effects. Consequently, they can be used to  study abductive
              reasoning.  The research program is to introduce  and study the formalism of
              revision  programming and to investigate  its applications in belief revision
              and abduction.
