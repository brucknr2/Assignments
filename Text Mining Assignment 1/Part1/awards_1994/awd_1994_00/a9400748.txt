Abstract    :
              Professor Chinburg will work on Galois Module Structure for  Schemes and the
              connection between capacity theory and  intersection theory on varieties. In
              particular he will work on  Euler characteristics using equivariant
              Riemann-Roch theorems. He  will also work on limits of metrizied cycles in
              arbitrary  codimension.    This project falls into the general area of
              arithmetic geometry -  a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of
              mathematics:  number theory and geometry.  This combination has proved 
              extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems that  withstood
              generations.  Among its many consequences are new error  correcting codes. 
              Such codes are essential for both modern  computers (hard disks) and compact
              disks.
