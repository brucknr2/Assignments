Abstract    :
              9400019  Narum       This award to the Independent Colleges Office  makes
              possible a series of seminars and workshops  on undergraduate science
              facilities.  The goals  are to: 1) equip institutional teams from 
              predominantly undergraduate institutions to  prepare competitive proposals to
              the NSF, and to  other funding agencies, public and private, for  their science
              facilities modernization projects;  and 2) support the process of facilities 
              modernization, so that the science, mathematics  and engineering programs for
              undergraduate  students on those campuses are strengthened.  With  full
              participation from the United Negro College  Fund, this series of workshops and
              seminars also  seeks to incorporate the needs of Historically  Black Colleges
              and Universities, thus paying  attention to scientific workforce diversity 
              issues.  This project is important since it seeks  to include small colleges
              into the mainstream of  rebuilding their research and research training 
              infrastructure.  This is of great significance to  this country since these are
              the institutions from  which a high percentage of Americans emerge and go  on
              to become our scientists and engineers.
