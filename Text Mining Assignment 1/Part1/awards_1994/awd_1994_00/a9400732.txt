Abstract    :
              This research is directed towards the development, implementation,  and
              demonstration of advanced model-based signal processing  algorithms for
              real-time measurement of wafer temperature profile  in Rapid Thermal Processing
              (RTP), RTP cluster tools are  strategically important for submicron
              semiconductor manufacturing  because of trends towards reduced thermal budget
              and tightened  process control requirements on large diameter silicon wafers.  
              Despite its significant advantages, commercial versions of RTP  modules for
              various chemical vapor deposition applications are not  available.    In this
              project, the investigators are developing advanced model-  based signal
              processing algorithms, which when coupled with the  acoustic thermometry and
              acoustic/pyrometer approaches, accurately  measure the wafer temperature
              profile at fast acquisition rates and  with a minimum number of sensors.  This
              entails algorithm  development, implementation, and validation using real data
              from  commercial RTP tools at UT-Austin and SEMATECH.
