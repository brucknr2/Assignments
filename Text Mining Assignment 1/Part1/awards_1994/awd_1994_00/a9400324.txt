Abstract    :
              This award funds the research of Prof. Eric Stade into the  Ramanujan
              Conjecture.  This is a well known conjecture in the  theory of automorphic
              forms that connects two apparently  unconnected spectrum.  Today,  the result
              is firmly established  in a few special cases.  This research falls under the
              general heading of Number Theory.  Number Theory is the study of the properties
              of the whole numbers  and is the oldest branch of mathematics. From the
              beginning  problems in number theory have furnished the driving force to 
              creation of new mathematics in almost all parts of the  discipline. One of the
              philosophies of modern number theory is  that many facts about numbers can be
              studied using calculus.   This approach is very evident in the theory of
              automorphic forms.   This kind of number theory is very technical and deep, but
              it has  had astonishing applications in areas like theoretical computer 
              science and coding theory.
