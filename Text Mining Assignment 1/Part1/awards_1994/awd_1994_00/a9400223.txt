Abstract    :
              9400223  Bank    The objective of the project is to continuously monitor and 
              evaluate the performance of a demonstration project to be  constructed in the
              District of Columbia.  The demonstration  project will utilize state-of-the-art
              advanced composite material  reinforcements in the form of fiber-reinforced
              plastic (FRP)  gratings to reinforce a full-scale highway bridge deck.  It is 
              the first full-size demonstration project of this type to be  conducted in the
              United States.  This award will support the  necessary data acquisition
              equipment and student support to  monitor the long-term deformation and
              durability of the  demonstration project.  ***
