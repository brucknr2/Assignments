Abstract    :
              9400600  Xia       The investigation will examine the structure of C*-algebras 
              generated by Toeplitz operators and singular integral operators  associated
              within-dimensional flows. This class of C*-algebras  includes many classical
              examples. The investigation is  particularly directed to the case where n is
              greater than 1. In  this case each algebra contains a chain of ideals that will
              be  analyzed carefully. These ideals will be used to compute K-  groups, which
              are important invariants for the classification of  C*-algebras. The k-groups
              will also be used to study the  invertibility of systems of Toeplitz operators.
              In this  connection an attempt will be made to determine the stable rank  of
              certain commutator ideals. An analysis will be made of certain  automorphisms
              of the Toeplitz algebra on the unit circle which  are induced by homeomorphisms
              of the circle.  This project investigates certain algebras generated by
              classical  operators that arise from the study of singular integral  equations.
              These equations can be traced back to applications in  engineering and
              manufacturing such as the equation of the airfoil  and the stamping of metal
              plates. The abstract problem here is  the classification of these algebras
              using invariants. The  contributions will be to many fields of pure mathematics
               including ergodic theory, analysis and geometry.  ***
