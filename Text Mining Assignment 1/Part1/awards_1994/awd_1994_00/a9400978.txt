Abstract    :
              9400978  Tataru       This award supports mathematical research on problems
              arising  in the theory of partial differential equations.  Several projects 
              are to be considered. The first is a continuation of work on  viscosity
              solutions for fully nonlinear first and second order  Hamilton-Jacobi equations
              with unbounded Hamiltonian in infinite  dimensions.  The goal is to build upon
              the earlier work to consider  issues such as the existence of discontinuous
              solutions, equations  arising in dynamic programming corresponding to optimal
              control or  differential games and second order problems in infinite 
              dimensions.  Other work will focus on the study of unique  continuation
              problems for solutions to linear partial differential  equations and the
              problem of determining the minimal regularity of  the coefficients for which
              such results can be obtained.  A final  goal is that of obtaining a complete
              characterization of the  essential spectrum for semigroups generated by
              hyperbolic boundary  value problems with applications in stabilization.        
              Partial differential equations form a basis for mathematical  modeling of the
              physical world.  The role of mathematical analysis  is not so much to create
              the equations as it is to provide  qualitative and quantitative information
              about the solutions.  This  may include answers to questions about uniqueness,
              smoothness and  growth.  In addition, analysis often develops methods for 
              approximation of solutions and estimates on the accuracy of these 
              approximations.  ***
