Abstract    :
              9400310  Schuller    This Americas Program award will support  Dr. Ivan 
              Schuller of the University of California, San Diego,  in a
              theoretical-experimental collaboration in the  field of magnetic thin films,
              with Prof. Ricardo  Ramirez of the Universidad Catolica, Santiago, Chile.  The
              studies proposed are geared towards understanding  thin film growth in a
              quantitative fashion.  From the  experimental point of view thin films and
              interfaces  will be characterized using several growth techniques  and a large
              variety of structural and chemical  characterization techniques.  Prof.Ramirez
              has been  conducting theoretical studies of thin film growth in  Chile, while
              Dr. Schuller has an experimental program  in the same field underway in the
              U.S.  This award  will allow coupling of both programs.    The area is of
              importance to researchers working in  technologies requiring thin films and
              multilayer film  metallic growth and characterization.  These include  the
              magnetic recording industry, sensor technology,  and new technologies growing
              out of giant magneto-  resistance phenomena.    ***
