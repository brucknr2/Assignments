Abstract    :
              Lorenz           This award supports research in ring theory, focusing on the 
              representation theory of rings of invariants under finite group actions. 
              Particular  attention will be given to the structure of the Grothendieck
              groups, G_0(R) and K_0(R),   for certain specific types of invariant rings R.
              The main objective for G_0(R) is to give a  description in terms of Brauer
              characters of the acting group.  Especially important in  connection with
              K_0(R) are the Hattori-Stallings trace and, more general, the Chern  characters
              in cyclic homology.  While part of this project will concern the classical 
              commutative setting, in particular linear actions on polynomial rings and
              multiplicative  actions on Laurent polynomial rings, the investigation of
              certain classes of  noncommutative invariants will also be pursued.  This topic
              promises a rich interplay  between the areas of commutative and noncommutative
              ring theory, representation  theory of finite groups, homological algebra, and
              algebraic K-theory.           A ring is an  algebraic object having both an
              addition and a multiplication defined on it.  These  structures arise naturally
              in many different settings and are of interest in mathematics,  computer
              science, engineering and physics. ***
