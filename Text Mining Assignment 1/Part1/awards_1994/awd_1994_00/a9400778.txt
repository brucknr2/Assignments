Abstract    :
              9400778  Finn       This award supports mathematical research on capillarity 
              theory and geometrical questions for liquid bridges, for  (asymmetric) pendent
              liquid drops and for slowly rotating fluid  masses.  Exotic behavior for
              surfaces of curvature type in wedges  and proboscis domains and a-priori
              curvature estimates for  H-graphs will also be studied.  Some of these
              investigations are  to be conducted in connection with space experiments, in 
              cooperation with NASA and with the European Space Agency.  Others  relate to
              the joint Stanford-Lockheed Gravity-B experiment to use  orbiting gyroscopes in
              a test of the general relativity theory  and a Stanford experiment of the
              equivalence principle between  gravitational and inertial mass.  These studies
              will include  reference calculations, but the underlying substance of the work 
              will be mathematical.         The formal theory is being developed from a
              completely  rigorous point of view involving analysis of solutions of partial 
              differential equations from a geometric perspective.  The  resulting
              experiments can be regarded as precise tests of the  underlying physical
              hypotheses on which the mathematical  formalism is based.  The physical
              problems continue, in turn, to  suggest new mathematical questions.   ***
