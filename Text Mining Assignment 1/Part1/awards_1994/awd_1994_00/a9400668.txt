Abstract    :
              9400668  Goodge  This award is for support to convene an international
              scientific  conference on the Ross Orogeny in Antarctica, entitled "Ross 
              Orogen: Crustal Structure and Plate Tectonic Significance".  This  workshop
              will be the third in a series of international conferences  (two previous
              meetings were held in the Netherlands, 1992 and  Italy, 1993) convened by the
              Lithospheric Investigation of the Ross  Sea Area (LIRA) group of earth
              scientists which is endorsed by the  Geology and Geophysics Working Groups of
              the Scientific Committee  on Antarctic Research (SCAR).  Because of the strong
              U.S. activity  in geological research in the Transantarctic Mountains and the
              Ross  Sea areas, it is appropriate to host the next meeting at a U.S. 
              institution.  The proposed budget for conference support includes  planning,
              logistical and travel subsidy costs for U.S. professional  and student
              participants on an as-needed basis, with priority given  to students and
              post-doctoral researchers.  ***
