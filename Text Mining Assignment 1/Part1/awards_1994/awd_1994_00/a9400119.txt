Abstract    :
              9400119  Settles       The award is for research to improve understanding of the
                 dynamics of the assist gas used with laser cutting to blow away    molten
              material and plasma, with a view to improving performance.   The technology of
              supersonic microjets will be transferred to the   field of laser cutting to
              improve cutting speed and efficiency by   maintaining supersonic flow along the
              entire cutting edge of the    kerf.  Melt removal is enhanced and material
              redeposition in the    kerf is avoided.  Significant improvements in
              conventional coaxial   assist-gas delivery will also be sought by improving
              nozzle design.  The work is primarily experimental and involves development of 
              appropriate nozzles and microjets, and cutting trials using actual  commercial
              laser equipment.       The research is expected to impact the fundamental
              knowledge  base related to gas dynamics as well as the efficiency of the key 
              manufacturing technology of laser cutting.  Improvements in assist  gas
              dynamics are expected to translate directly into faster,  cleaner laser cuts. 
              More powerful lasers now becoming available  would also benefit from the
              improved assist gas dynamics expected  as a result of this research.
