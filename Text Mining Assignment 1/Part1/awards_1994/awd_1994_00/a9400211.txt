Abstract    :
              Bohren/Abstract       The objective of this research is an optical examination
              of  green thunderstorms using a spectral photometer to evalute two  competing
              theories about the transmission, absorption and scatting  of (visible) light in
              and near thunderstorms. The observations will  ne made in Oklahoma during a
              meteorologicalfield experiment  (VORTEX) designed to investigate tornados.
