Abstract    :
              9400029  San Andres  A combined experimental and analytical study will be
              conducted of  the flow mechanics of squeeze film dampers and their interaction 
              with the dynamics of a rotor-bearing system.  Operational regimes  with dynamic
              cavitation will be emphasized.  Linear and nonlinear  interactions between the
              rotor and dampers will be quantified in  the frequency domain.  ***
