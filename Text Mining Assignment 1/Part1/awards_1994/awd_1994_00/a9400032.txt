Abstract    :
                9400032  Newton       The project focuses on the development of multi-scale 
              singular perturbation techniques and nonlinear WKB methods  to study the
              interaction of high frequency oscillations with  nonlinear dispersive waves. A
              particular emphasis will be  placed on rapidly forced amplitude equations
              arising in  hydrodynamic stability theory. A general goal will be to  construct
              explicit approximate solutions showing  interactions of high and low frequency
              waves in the form of  asymptotic expansions. Specifically, we will study a
              rapidly  forced Ginzburg-Landau model of relevance to transition to  turbulence
              problems, and the Zakharov system, a hyperbolic-  dispersive system modeling
              the interaction of fast acoustic  waves with a dispersive plasma. A main goal
              of the work  described in the proposal is to understand how higher order  terms
              in an amplitude equation hierarchy can affect lower  order dynamical wave
              interactions. In general, the higher  order terms can feed high frequency
              oscillations into the  lower order system creating important long time effects
              akin  to the secular behavior well known in the context of  celestial
              mechanics. The methods to be developed will give a  useful way of tracking the
              influence of externally generated  high frequency oscillations on evolving
              nonlinear dispersive  waves.
