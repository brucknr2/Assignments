Abstract    :
                     9400307    Middleton  This project involves the dissertation research of
              a student in  cultural anthropology from Yale University, studying an elite 
              secondary school in Kenya, Africa.  The student will conduct  participant
              observation in the school, and study the development  through its colonial
              history of the school's customary practices  and the educational values of both
              teachers and students.  In  addition the student will do a survey of a sample
              of students in  their home communities, to assess their cultural backgrounds. 
              The focus of the study will be to determine how the students'  cultural
              backgrounds and knowledge of history interact with the  school's program as
              developed through its own historical  trajectory through colonialism and
              independence to the present  situation of many global influences.  The focal
              event to be  explained is a violent attact against girls by boys protesting 
              some administrative decisions in a similar elite school in Kenya  in 1991.  
              This research is important because schooling is commonly thought  to be the
              unique road to cultural and social advancement in  developing nations. 
              Understanding how one elite school works in  historical context will provide a
              case study that will be  valuable in interpreting and reacting to student
              protests and  activities in similar schools in similar countries.  ***
