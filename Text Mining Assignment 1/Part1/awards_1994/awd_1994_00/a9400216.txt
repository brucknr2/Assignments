Abstract    :
              9400216  Hearn  The overall objective of the research is to increase the 
              efficiency and applicability of large-scale optimization methods.  Applications
              include models in operations research, production  systems, electrical and
              civil engineering and in the sciences.  The development includes both
              theoretical and computational  investigations of decomposition techniques which
              allow division of  a large problem into more tractable subproblems.  The new 
              techniques will be specifically applied to network models where  congestion or
              other nonlinearities are important and to models  for production planning.  By
              doing so, the range and versatility  of the methods, as well as their
              effectiveness, will be  demonstrated.  ***
