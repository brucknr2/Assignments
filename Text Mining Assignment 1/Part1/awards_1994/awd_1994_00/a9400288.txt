Abstract    :
              9400288  Teo  This award, made in the Advanced Materials and Procesing  Program
              will focus on the design, synthesis and  characterization of crystalline,
              hybrid inorganic polymers with  organic spacers (IPOS). Typically the inorganic
              polymers are  anionic metal-ligand coordination polymers such as cadmium 
              thiocyanate and the organic spacers are cationic host-guest  complexes such as
              alkali metal crown ether complexes. The crown  ether-alkali metal complex not
              only serves as a spacer, but  will also control crystal packing. By controlling
              crystal  symmetry, nonlinear optical properties will be engineered into  the
              IPOS crystals. The ultimate goal of the research is to  better understand the
              underlying principles of crystallization  and the origin of their physical
              properties. The choice of IPOS  series will allow concomitant but separate
              molecular and  crystal engineering.    This research will pursue a systematic
              study of the synthesis  and structure of new classes of IPOS crystals leading
              to the  development of materials of technological importance as well as  the
              discovery of new fabrication methods and new models for  crystallization
              processes.
