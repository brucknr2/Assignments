Abstract    :
              9400842  McEachran   The objectives of the proposed research are to survey and
              inventory the fish species that occur in the Gulf of Mexico, and to summarize
              these data in the form of a book on the fishes of the Gulf and as a computer
              data base.  The proposed audience of the book is the scientists, students and
              fishers with interests in the fishes of this region, and the scientists and
              students studying biogeography of the Gulf and more inclusive areas.  The
              computer data base will summarize the distributions of fishes from the Gulf
              residing in 10 major natural history collections.  Specifically we propose to:
              1) list, fully describe and distinguish from other species all of the species
              that occur in the Gulf; 2)  provide pen and ink, pencil shaded illustrations of
              all species; 3) provided keys to all ordinal, familial and specific taxa that
              occur in the Gulf; 4) briefly summarize life history and distributional
              information of all species; 5) combine all of the information into a book on
              the fishes of the Gulf of Mexico; and 6) build a computer data base for all
              verified species records of the Gulf of Mexico.  These objectives will be
              accomplished by surveying museums with specimens and the literature with
              references to fishes from the Gulf of Mexico.  To data the project slightly
              over one-half complete.  Approximately 1,150 pages of text describing 670
              species in 130 families and 38 orders have been prepared.  A total of 650
              species of fishes have been illustrated, and separate illustrations have been
              prepared for representatives of six families to define photophore patterns used
              in identification of species and for specialized structures mentioned in the
              keys to species.  It is anticipated that the remaining 600 to 700 species and
              68 family descriptions, 600 to 700 species illustrations, and the surveys of
              ten natural history collections can be completed within three years.  Benefits
              of the proposed study include:  1) an up-to-date synopsis of the systematics,
              life history and distribution of t he fishes that occur in the Gulf of Mexico,
              the ninth largest body of water in the World, 2) a single source for the
              identification of fishes in the Gulf and 3) an initiation of a computer data
              base of distributional records for the fishes that occur in the Gulf.  It is
              anticipated that the sixth objective and third benefit will not be completed at
              the end of the three year period of the proposed study.
