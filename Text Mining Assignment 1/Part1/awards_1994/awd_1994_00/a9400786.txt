Abstract    :
              9400786  Sell          This  is  an award under the Grants for Improving 
              Doctoral  Dissertation  Research program.  It is a study of the  influences  on
                the  way  in  which  parents  and  teachers  communicate  in  discussing
              child performance in school.  The research will  focus  on  scheduled
              conferences between African-American, Hispanic, and  Anglo  mothers and
              kindergarten teachers.  Through a  combination  of  participant  observation 
              in the  school  setting,  discourse  analysis  of  videotapes of the
              parent-teacher  conferences,  and  interviews with both parents and teachers
              before and after  these  conferences,  the  researcher will test ideas about 
              the  way  in  which pre-existing mental schema and variable power differentials
               influence  how  effectively parents and teachers understand  each  other.     
               Previous research has indicated that parental involvement in  school  has  an 
              influence  on the school  performance  of  their  children.   However,  there 
              are a number  of  barriers  to  such  involvement,  and difficulties
              communicating with teachers  is  a  central  barrier.   Through systematic
              study of  the  process  of  communication  between parents and teachers,  this 
              project  will  help  us  understand  these  communication  barriers  better 
              and  provide  advice about how parent-teacher communications could  be 
              improved.  In addition to the scientific gains to be achieved  by  the  
              research,  this  award  will  materially  assist  a  highly  promising  student
               in  completing  research  for  the   Ph.   D.  dissertation.   Thus  it 
              contributes to  the  future  scientific  manpower  of  the nation and the
              thorough training  of  the  next  generation of social scientists.  ***
