Abstract    :
              9400091   Finzer    This project aims to develop a computer learning environment
              and  curriculum materials for use in teaching data analysis and  statistics at
              the high school level.  The proposed curriculum  materials will be usable in a
              semester-long course, as  substantial units within other mathematics and
              science courses,  and as skill-focused components of other courses.   This
              project  will bring learning experiences to secondary school classrooms  that
              intimately involve students with concepts and technologies  they need to become
              informed and productive participants in the  information age.  The software,
              provisionally named  StochasticsLab, is a conceptually unified platform for
              data  gathering and exploration, simulation, and statistical analysis.   The
              innovative design supports the latest understanding about how  children learn
              stochastic ideas, including the importance of  user-constructed measures, the
              problems and potentials associated  with categorical variables, and the need to
              feed simulation data  into data analysis tools.  It is based from the ground up
              on net-  worked collaboration, access to large datasets, and visual 
              explanation of how things work. While the software is expected to  enhance
              existing courses, the curriculum materials will require  the presence of
              computers and software.  In this project, the  software is the major
              innovation.  ***
