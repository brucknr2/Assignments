Abstract    :
              This project builds on gathering and interpreting high-accuracy low  spatial
              resolution observations of solar magnetic and velocity  fields from the Wilcox
              Solar Observatory and active participation  in the Global Oscillation Network
              Group and International Research  on the Interior of the Sun global
              oscillations observing networks.   The request for support for improvement and
              continued maintenance  of the facility will continue gathering, reducing, and
              distributing  data.  Finally, the SolarMail system supported in part by this 
              proposal will continue to expand and provide a valuable service to  more than
              1000 scientists.
