Abstract    :
              9400644  Liggett        Professors Liggett, Mountford and Schonmann will work on
               several projects related to two areas of Probability Theory:  Interacting
              Particle Systems and Brownian Motion. The first of  these is the study of
              probabilistic models for the evolution of  large physical systems which undergo
              phase transitions, while the  second is a more classical model which has played
              a central role  in Probability for much of this century. Among the problems to
              be  considered in the first area are: obtaining good bounds on the  critical
              values which separate the single phase from the  multiphase parameter region,
              and determining rates of convergence  to equilibrium in several models,
              including the stochastic Ising  model and nearest particle systems. In the
              second area, detailed  properties of the level sets of the Brownian sheet will
              be  investigated.       A relatively new and very active area of Probability
              Theory  is known as Interacting Particle Systems. It is devoted to the 
              analysis of probabilistic models for the evolution of physical  systems which
              can be in two or more phases - pieces of metal  (magnetized or not) or water
              (ice, water, steam) for example.  Some results of investigations in this area
              also have  applications in other areas, such as the study of queues and 
              transmission of disease. Professors Liggett, Mountford and  Schonmann will
              continue their work on some of the basic problems  in this field. One of them
              is the determination of the regions of  physical parameters (temperature,
              pressure, etc.) in which  various phases occur, and the behavior of the systems
              near points  at which the phase description changes. Another is a study of the 
              speed with which systems approach equilibrium.
