Abstract    :
              Filaseta             This award funds the continued work of Professor  Michael
              Filaseta as he refines the new differencing techniques he  developed in joint
              work with Prof. Ognian Trifonov.  Prof.  Filaseta has several specific problems
              on which he will apply the  method.  These problems include questions about the
              distribution  of integer values of fairly general functions modulo one, and 
              questions about the gaps between squarefree numbers and gaps  between
              squarefull numbers.             This work is in the general field of analytic
              number  theory.  The field of analytic number theory applies the  techniques of
              calculus to the discrete realm of the whole  numbers.  Calculus was developed
              to aid the analysis of  continuous mathematical objects.  The idea of using
              continuous  methods to investigate discrete objects is two centuries old, but 
              with the work of the modern analytic number theorists, the field  has had a 
              new rebirth and led to a deeper understanding of the  whole numbers. ***
