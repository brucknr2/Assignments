Abstract    :
              9400209  Wagner    This three-year award supports U.S.-Italy cooperative
              research  Between Norman Wagner and Michael Paulaitis of the University of 
              Delaware and Dr. Bruno D'Aguanno at the Center for Advanced  Studies, in
              Sardinia, Italy.  Drs. Wagner and Paulaitis, in the  Department of Chemical
              Engineering, and Dr. D'Aguanno of the  Department of Computational Biophysics,
              propose to develop  massively parallel simulation algorithms for calculating
              ion  solubilities and mobilities in hydrated polymers with the goal of 
              applying these computational tools to design selective reverse  osmosis
              membranes based on the chemical composition and "local"  structural properties
              of the polymer.      A severe limitation in applying current science and
              technology to  predict ion solubilities and mobilities is the inability to 
              characterize quantitatively the unique restructuring of waters of  hydration. 
              The international collaboration will merge US  expertise in thermodynamics and
              massively parallel simulation  with the Italian expertise in large-scale
              simulations of water  and ionic solutions.  This collaboration will contribute
              to a  program recently established at the Center for Molecular and  Engineering
              Thermodynamics at the University of Delaware to  simulate water structures
              around hydrated ionic species to  predict their solubilities and mobilities in
              hydrated polymers.   This new collaboration will also foster closer
              interactions  between the Delaware Center and the Sardinian Center.  * * *
