Abstract    :
              9400666     This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work of
              Professors  Schuster, Wilson, and Courtney at New York University to study the
              scope and  mechanism of photocycloadditions of fullerenes by enones. The
              studies focus on an  analysis for steric and electronic influences of the
              fullerene functionalizations,  sensitizing and quenching experiments to address
              the reaction mechanism, and  analysis of the interaction between the reactants
              by photophysical probes.  Characterization of fullerene excited states and
              triplet 1,4-biradicals is sought by  photosensitized electron transfer
              reactions and time-resolved photoacoustic  calorimetry.     In this project
              Drs. Schuster, Wilson, and Courtney will conduct  photocycloadditions of
              fullerenes by a variety of enones. Their research provides a  novel route to
              functionalize fullerenes and addresses in detail all parameters that  influence
              the photochemical reaction pathway. The significance of their studies on 
              fullerenes is a profound expansion of the important photocycloadditions of
              olefins.  This research will also provide much valued information on the
              photochemical and  photophysical properties of fullerenes.
