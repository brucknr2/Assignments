Abstract    :
              Schelp       This award funds the work of Prof. Richard Schelp in graph  theory.
               Prof. Schelp will study special edge colorings of graphs  and their
              connections to Ramsey numbers or special edge  labelings.  In particular there
              are three conjectures, two due to  Schelp and one to Burr and Erdos about edge
              colorings that Prof.  Schelp will study in this project.          The research
              is in the general area of combinatorics, in   particular graph theory.
              Combinatorics attempts to find efficient  methods to study how discrete
              collections can be organized.    Graphs are arrangements of points connected by
              lines.  The   behavior of discrete collections like graphs is extremely  
              important in modeling systems and plays a role in modern   computing,
              communications and operations.  For example, the   design of large networks, as
              in telephone systems, and the design  of algorithms in computer science all use
              graphs in their   development, and make use of combinatorial research. ***
