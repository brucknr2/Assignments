Abstract    :
              9400413  Maxwell       The American Mathematical Society requests a grant in the
              amount  of $20,000 for participant support of the first quadrennial John von 
              Neumann Symposium, to be held  in the summer of 1994.  The  supplemental
              funding from the NSF will be used t support travel and  Nonlinear Wave
              Equations", was selected by the 1993 AMS Committee on  Summer Institutes and
              Special Symposia.  The Symposium will provide  the opportunity for
              cross-fertilization between the classical theory  of nonlinear wave equations
              on the one hand and operator algebra on  the other.  This is most appropriate
              given von Neumann's deep and  central interest in the relation between operator
              algebra and quantum  mechanics and the announced goal of the Symposium to treat
              topics of  emerging significance that are likely to underlie future
              mathematical  development.  Members of the Organizing Committee for the 1994
              von  Neumann Symposium are:  Haim Brezia (co-chair), Irving Segal (co-  chair),
              William Arveson, Robert Blattner and Thomas Branson.  The  1994 John von
              Neumann Symposium will be held during a one week period  in June, 1994, in the
              greater Boston area.
