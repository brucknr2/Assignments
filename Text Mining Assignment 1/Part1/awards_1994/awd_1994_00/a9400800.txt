Abstract    :
              With this award, the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic  Chemistry
              Program supports research on organometallic radicals by  Dr. Dwight A. Sweigart
              of the Chemistry Department, Brown  University.  Ligand substitution reactions,
              metal dependence of  reactivity patterns, and rates of electron transfer
              reactions  will be investigated for electrochemically generated 17- or 19- 
              electron species.  In addition, catalytic ligand substitution and 
              electroactivation of hydrocarbons will be studied.  A second area  of
              investigation is metal-promoted synthetic routes to indoles,  diterpenes, and
              steroids.  Chiral metal complexes will be tested  as effective reagents in the
              preparation of optically pure  products.  High oxidation state species are
              expected in the  reaction of oxirenes with metals to form the first
              oxirene-metal  complexes.    Odd-electron organometallic compounds are reactive
              species  thought to play important roles in catalytic reactions.  Using 
              electrochemical methods, Sweigart can produce and characterize  these species
              directly and thus predict their reactivities.   Because the systems to be
              studied include both homogeneous and  heterogenous examples, the results will
              provide insight into  surface corrosion as well as solution reactions.  The 
              investigation of large hydrocarbon ring compounds is biologically  relevant and
              establishing controlled synthetic routes may prove  useful to many
              investigators.  The study will also extend the  electrochemical methods
              available for characterizing chemical  processes.
