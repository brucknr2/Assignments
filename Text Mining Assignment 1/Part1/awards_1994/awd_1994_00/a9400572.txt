Abstract    :
              9400572  Kamath       The research builds upon previous work which involves the 
              construction of a generic, persistent object oriented "based model"  of a
              system that is maintained in a current state of accurate and  detailed system
              representation at all times.  This base model is  specific to an organization,
              and supports modeling across several  problem domains using multiple analysis
              and optimization tools.       This project will lead to the conceptualization
              and  development of a new, comprehensive, and cohesive modeling  environment
              for aiding manufacturing systems.  In the past, this  process has depended
              largely upon a "brute force" approach of  "cutting and trying". based upon as
              disjoint mixture of  methodologies, intuition, and judgement.  The
              comprehensive  modeling environment well permit changes to the system to be 
              considered at any time and evaluated within the context of a total  system
              analysis and evaluation.
