Abstract    :
              9400276  Patton    Technical abstract:  Microwave magnetic envelope solitons
              will be  investigated in thin magnetic films.  The work will cover:  (1) the 
              role of the dispersion time, the nonlinear response time, the  relaxation time,
              and the propagation time on soliton evolution, (2)  dipole-exchange spin wave
              solitons, (3) differences between optical  and magnetic solitons, (4) damping,
              (5) eigenmode and non-eigenmode  solitons, (6) the control of interactions by
              means of the carrier  phase, (7) profiling of microwave magnetic solitons by
              inductive  probes and Brillouin light scattering, and (8) solitons at 
              millimeter wave frequencies.    Non-technical abstract:  Solitons are nonlinear
              pulses which  propagate without changing shape and which can pass through each 
              other.  Optical soliton research is important for a fundamental  understanding
              of nonlinear optics and for communications  technology.  This program concerns
              microwave solitons in magnetic  thin films.  Such magnetic solitons are of
              fundamental interest in  the field of nonlinear high frequency magnetics and
              for microwave  and millimeter wave signal processing and communications 
              technology.  The goal of the work is to reach a basic understanding  of
              nonlinear magnetic wave packets in thin films.  The work will  utilize
              microwave and optical measuring techniques.  ***
