Abstract    :
              9400687  Wu       This award supports mathematical research on problems  arising
              from the classical theory of complex analysis and  potential theory approached
              from several new points of view.  The  work concerns investigations into the
              nature of null sets for  doubling measures and related problems on
              quasiconformal mapping.  In particular the question of whether null sets of
              quasisymmetric  homeomophisms on the unit circle are invariant under
              bilipschitz  homeomorphisms.  Work will also continue on harmonic measures for 
              uniformly elliptic partial differential operators.   Particular emphasis will
              be placed on building operators on the  positive orthant by genuinely
              n-dimensional methods so that the  support of the corresponding harmonic
              measures have small  Hausdorff dimensions.  Effort will be made to investigate 
              practical ways of estimating expected lifetime for conditional  Brownian motion
              for domains satisfying a capacity density  condition.  A new characterization
              of such domains is expected to  result. Research in complex analysis and
              potential theory focuses  on problems related to real and complex functions of 
              several variables which satisfy certain partial differential  equations. The
              theory is highly geometric and methods for  attacking the many important
              problems are drawn from a multitude  of mathematical theories such as
              probability, differential  geometry, differential equations and functional
              analysis.  ***
