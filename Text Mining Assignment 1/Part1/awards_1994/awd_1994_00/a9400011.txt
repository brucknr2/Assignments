Abstract    :
              9400011  Stevenson  Migration is a widely recognized but poorly understood
              phenomenon in the tropics.  Species that migrate need special consideration
              when developing conservation plans because they depend on at least two seasonal
              habitats and they may rely on resources at stopover sites allow the migration
              paths.  Recently the east-west migration of butterflies over the mountains near
              Monteverde, Costa Rica.  A surprising large fraction, approximately 80% (260
              species), of the extant Pacific slope and lowland fauna move seasonally to the
              Atlantic side.  We will quantify the magnitude, direction and temporal
              components of migrants in the Monteverde region.  Changes in population levels
              and local resources of four focal species will be studied along the entire
              migration route.  A comparison of life-history, morphological, and
              physiological traits will be used to rank habitat specialization and the
              migration capability of species.  Comparisons will also be made between
              migrants and residents of the dry forest to examine their relative
              sensitivities to habitat fragmentation.  A broad geographic perspective on
              butterfly migration will be provided by surveys in other parts of Costa Rica. 
              Together these studies will advance the conservation of tropical invertebrates
              and increase our ability to identify the unique resource needs of migrant
              species.
