Abstract    :
                    ABSTRACT  OPP-9400929  KINGSTON      The overall goal of this
              anthropological research is to understand the resilience of the King Island
              Inupiat as a distinct indigenous community in Alaska. Although different
              acculturative processes have led the King Islanders to move from their Bering
              Strait Island, a strong sense of community and identity still exists and is
              particularly expressed by music and dance traditions. These traditions are a
              repository of King Island history and life. Archival film footage and oral
              history accounts will be used in structured meetings with Native Elders in
              order to record and reclaim this Alaska Native heritage. This study contributes
              to the development of anthropological theory with reference to both the
              scientific use of film archives, and understanding mediums of cultural
              continuity and change.         ??
