Abstract    :
              9400074  Wootters       An REU Site will be continued in the Physics Department
              of  Williams College.  About half of the students will come from  Williams and
              half from other schools.  Each student will work at  Williams for ten weeks,
              during which time she or he will be a  member of a small research group
              consisting of between two and  five undergraduates and advised by one faculty
              member.  The  students will be divided about equally between experimental and 
              theoretical physics.  The particular projects we have in mind are  in the
              following areas: quantum information theory, optical fiber  lasers, laser
              cooling, and cryogenic masers.  In addition to  their research projects, the
              students will participate in daily  teas and weekly seminars provided
              specifically for the REU  students, as well as weekly lunch and lecture open to
              all science  students and faculty at Williams.  ***
