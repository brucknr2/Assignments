Abstract    :
              9400926  Owen   Although Paraguay occurs at an interface between temperate and
              subtropical elements, with influences derived from Atlantic Rainforest,
              Pantanal, Cerrado, and Wet and Dry Chaco, its small mammal (marsupials, bts,
              rodents, and xenarthrans) and associated parasitic arthropod faunae are poorly
              known, even for a South American country.  Moreover, its rate of habitat
              fragmentation and deterioration may be as high or higher than that in many
              areas of lowland Amazonia.  An intensive and comprehensive survey of small
              mammals and their ectoparasites will be conducted at 24 sites, which together
              represent a broad diversity of habitats and give special consideration to
              endangered or threatened areas.  Two years of field collection should produce
              10,000 mammal specimens and associated arthropods.  Subsequent analyses can
              take advantage of a design that focuses on the "complete specimen" and
              population-intensive sampling in areas where numerous species reach their
              distributional limits.  The "complete specimen" entails collection of multiple
              independent data sets fro each individual that comprise morphological
              (myological, reproductive tract, skull and post cranial skeleton), karyotypic,
              genetic (protein allozymes, nuclear and extranucler DNA), ecological, and
              ectoparasitic information.  As a result, a number of comprehensive analyses
              related to community ecology, biogeography, systematics, and evolution can be
              performed for both small mammals and their ectoparasites.
