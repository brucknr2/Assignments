Abstract    :
              9400899  Spielberg       It is proposed to study C*-algebras obtained from
              boundary  actions of Fuchsian groups. These C*-algebras have interesting 
              relations with certain dynamical systems known as Smale spaces.  Smale spaces
              are a ubiquitous feature in dynamics. The relation  with Fuchsian groups arises
              from the hyperbolicity of the  dynamics, and promises to yield fine topological
              structure not  accessible by techniques of ergodic theory. It is also proposed 
              to continue the study of upper and lower spectral multiplicity in  the spectrum
              of a C*-algebra. These notions were introduced by  Archbold as tools to
              understand trace functionals on  C*-algebras,and to analyze the structure of
              liminal ideals.  Applications are invisioned to the study of C*-algebras of
              groups  and groupoids.       An operator is an infinite dimensional version of
              a matrix.  These operators can be added and multiplied in a natural way  and
              consequently collections of operators can be consider as an  algebra of
              operators. This project deals with operator  algebras that arise in an
              interesting way from dynamical systems.  The important branch of mathematics
              called dynamical systems  attempts to understand the repeated action of
              transformations.  The successful completion of this project will be to the 
              mutual benefit of the abstract theory of operator algebras and  the important
              applied area of dynamical systems.  ***
