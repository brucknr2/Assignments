Abstract    :
              9400637  Dash    Technical abstract:  The research studies the fundamental basis
              of  premelting of ice and thermomolecular pressure, which cause frost  heave in
              frozen ground.  The dynamics of the efect are studied, by  polarimetry and
              interference microscopy, on single crystal facets  of ice, where interfacial
              melting causes a thin liquid film wetting  the interface.  The results are
              compared with theory, to  investigate the orientation dependence and the
              proximity effect.   A second part of the program studies transport of unfrozen
              liquid  in monosized powders, as simple examples of porous media.   
              Non-technical abstract:  This program studies fundamental  mechanisms of frost
              heave.  Typically, in frozen ground, frost  heave occurs as moisture is drawn
              toward lower temperatures.  This  project investigates the basic driving
              pressure and the flow of  moisture, by measurements of the effect on a single
              crystal of ice.   The experimental results are compared with prediction based
              on a  new, detailed theory of frost heave.  The program also includes a  study
              of frost heave in porous media, using specially prepared  artificial powders. 
              These powders are more uniform than typical  soils, thereby permitting a more
              detailed comparison with the  theory.  ***
