Abstract    :
              9400733  Rodin       The work supported by this award sets out to exploit recent
               mathematical developments applying concepts of circle packing to  classical
              problems of conformal mapping.  If one packs a simply  connected region with
              circles of a fixed radius then there is a  combinatorially equivalent packing
              of the unit disk, and this  circle packing isomorphism converges to the Riemann
              map of the  domain onto the disk as the radius tends to zero.  This idea, 
              which has led to an entirely new approach to ideas of conformal  mapping in
              recent years, will now be applied to study mappings of  multiply connected
              domains onto domains whose complement  consists solely of slits radiating from
              the origin.  The result  is known for many special cases - even some domains
              with  infinite connectivity.  That one can do it in general, was  first
              conjectured by Koebe in 1908.  He proved it for  finitely connected domains. 
              The combination of new tools from  circle packing and other advances in
              conformal mapping will be  applied in a concentrated effort to settle the Koebe
              conjecture  in its entirety.       Conformal mapping is the study of mappings
              of plane (and  higher dimensional) domains by transformations which  preserve
              infinitesimal angles and orientation.  The maps play  central roles in the
              geometric theory of analytic functions and  potential theory by reducing many
              questions concerning functions  defined on arbitrary domains to the same
              questions restricted to  a class of highly symmetric domains.  ***
