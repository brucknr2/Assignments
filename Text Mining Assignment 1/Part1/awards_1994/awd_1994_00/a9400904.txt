Abstract    :
              9400904  Phillips       The project will involve four lines of research. (1) A 
              continuing investigation of the notion of exponential rank in C*-  algebras. In
              particular, an attempt will be made to obtain a  better understanding of the
              exponential rank of homogeneous C*-  algebras and stable C*-algebras. (2)
              Investigation of related  work involving multiplicative commutators. (3)
              Continuation of  work on the K-theory of smooth crossed products. (4) A study
              of  spectra of elements of the reduced C*-algebras of free groups.      
              Operators are infinite dimensional generalizations of  matrices. There is a
              natural multiplication and addition of  operators and, consequently, some
              collections of operators can be  considered as mathematical structures called
              operator algebras.  There is an involution on operators much like the
              transposition  involution on matrices. An operator algebra that is closed under
               the action of this involution is called a star algebra. A C*-  algebra is a
              star operator algebra that has additional  topological properties. In many
              commutative algebras, elements  that have multiplicative inverses have
              logarithms or,  equivalently, can be written as an exponential. This is not the
               case in non-commutative C*-algebras. A portion of this project is  aimed at
              determining the number of exponential factors required  to write invertible
              elements as products of exponential.  ***
