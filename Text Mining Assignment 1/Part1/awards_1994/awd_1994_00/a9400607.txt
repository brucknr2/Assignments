Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              will aid in the  purchase of mass spectrometry data systems in the Chemistry
              Department at Montana State  University.  The research to be performed with
              this instrumentation include the following:           Studies of various high
              pressure gas phase ionic processes; the identification of the         neutral
              products formed in gas phase ionic processes; fundamental studies of desorption
                      ionization processes associated with FAB and Electrospray mass
              spectrometry; the         detection of environmentally interesting atmospheric
              components at the low- and sub-         parts per trillion level; organic
              transformations facilitated by platinum(II) and other         transition
              metals; biological control and signalling mechanisms involving macromolecular  
                    receptors in visual and neutrophil systems; the production of Taxol and
              Taxanes from         microbiological sources; and the identification of lipid
              peroxidation products generated         by environmental toxins.    Mass
              Spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe intimate structural details and
              to obtain  the molecular compositions of a vast array of organic, bioorganic
              and organometallic molecules.   The computer data systems allow
              state-of-the-art control of research grade mass spectrometers  which gives the
              chemist one of the most powerful tools available for the characterization of 
              compounds.  The acquisition of this capability in mass spectrometry is
              essential for the  prosecution of frontier research in many fields of
              chemistry.
