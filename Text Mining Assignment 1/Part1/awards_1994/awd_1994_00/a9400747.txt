Abstract    :
              Vidaver 9400747 The 7th International Congress of the Bacteriology and Applied
              Microbiology Division and the Mycology Division of the International Union of
              Microbiological Societies will meet in Prague, Czechoslovakia in July, 1994. 
              The Congress serves as a forum for microbiologists throughout the world to
              discuss recent advances in bacteriology and mycology.  The topics to be covered
              in the Congress include general bacteriology and mycology, industrial
              microbiology and specific topics such as use of molecular probes and nucleic
              acid sequencing in microbial systems, microbial ecology and microbial
              physiology. This meeting has as its goal to serve as a forum for
              microbiologists throughout the world to discuss recent advances in bacteriology
              and mycology.  Scientists with different backgrounds will interact so that each
              can benefit from the specialized knowledge of the specific sub disciplines of
              microbiology.  Participation of U.S. scientists is vital to increasing
              communication and interaction with microbiologists of other countries,
              especially in affording them an opportunity to collaborate with their Eastern
              European colleagues.
