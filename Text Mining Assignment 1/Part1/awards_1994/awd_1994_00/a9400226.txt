Abstract    :
                This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Facilities Program will
              help the  Department of Chemistry at Stanford University acquire a 500 MHz NMR
              spectrometer and  solid state accessories to be used to upgrade the existing
              400 MHz NMR spectrometer which will  be used in research.  The research
              activities to be supported include:  (1) studies on the  molecular basis of
              carcinogenesis, solution structures of peptide receptors, the synthesis and 
              mode of action of DNA cleaving agents, the synthesis of taxol analogues and
              studies on their  mode of action, mechanistic and synthetic organometallic
              chemistry, and mechanistic and  synthetic photochemistry, (2) stereochemistry
              and mechanism of organometallic reactions  in polymer synthesis and catalysis,
              (3) new approaches for synthetic efficiency, (4)  mechanistic enzymology of
              oxidosqualene cyclization, (5) Coenzyme A Analogs as Probes  of Enzymatic
              Reaction Mechanisms, and (6) Theoretical and Computational X-ray  Absorption
              Spectroscopy.    Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most
              powerful tool available to  chemists for the elucidation of the structure of
              molecules.  It is used to identify unknown  substances, characterize specific
              arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the  dynamics of
              interactions between molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR 
              spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. 
              The results from  these NMR studies are useful in the areas such as polymers
              and catalysis, and in biology.
