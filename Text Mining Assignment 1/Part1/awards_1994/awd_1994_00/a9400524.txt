Abstract    :
              Smith           The principal investigator will study finitely presented,
              noetherian graded  algebras, particularly the Sklyanin algebras.  The study of
              these algebras has been  significant in the development of noncommutative
              algebraic geometry.  A key problem  is to classify the fat point modules over
              the Sklyanin algebras.  The principal  investigator will also extend to higher
              dimensions the results he has obtained on the  4-dimensional Sklyanin algebras.
               In addition, noncommutative surfaces of  Gelfand-Kirillov dimension 3 will be
              studied.  This will provide a clearer understanding  of the general outline of
              noncommutative algebraic geometry.           This research is in  the general
              area of noncommutative ring theory.  The rings considered in the project  are
              of interest in many areas of mathematics including algebraic geometry.  Given a
               curve, one of these rings can be associated with certain points on the curve. 
              A better  understanding of these rings and this association will be useful in
              determine the  geometry of a given curve. ***
