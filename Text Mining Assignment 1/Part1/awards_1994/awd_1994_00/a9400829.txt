Abstract    :
              9400829  Janzen   This project is an ongoing biodiversity inventory of all
              species of caterpillars, their host plant relationships, and their species of
              parasitoids in thae tropical dry forest of the Guanacaste Conservation Area in
              northwestern Costa Rica.  The inventory pesults are designed to make
              caterpillars and their trophic relationships with food plants and parasitoids
              available to basic studies in ecology, systematics, behavior physiology and
              evolution, and to applied users in biodiversity prospecting, education,
              ecotourism and pest management.  The overall goal is to establish this
              biological system as an integral part of the non-destructive sustainable use of
              a complex tropical wildland by science and by Costa Rican society.
