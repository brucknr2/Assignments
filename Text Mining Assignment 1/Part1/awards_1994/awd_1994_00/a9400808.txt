Abstract    :
              9400808  Ojima  The focus of this research is the investigation of the Rh and 
              Rh-Co complex promoted silylcarbocyclization (SiCAC) reactions  of enynes,
              alkynals and diynes.  The SiCAC process will be  examined for scope and
              limitation, synthetic application and  mechanism.  Mechanistic studies will be
              carried out using  labeling experiments.  %%%  With this renewal award, the
              Synthetic Organic Program is  supporting the research of Dr. Iwao Ojima of the
              Department of  Chemistry at SUNY, Stony Brook.  Professor Ojima will focus his 
              work on developing new and efficient homogeneous catalytic  reactions that will
              provide useful synthetic methods for the  preparation of organosilicon
              compounds.  ***
