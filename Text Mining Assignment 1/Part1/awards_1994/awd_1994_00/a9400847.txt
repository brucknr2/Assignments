Abstract    :
              In this project in the Organic Dynamics Program of the Chemistry   Division,
              Edward L. Clennan of the University of Wyoming will study the   reactions of
              singlet oxygen with sulfides, disulfides, sulfenamides, and   sulfenate esters.
              Sulfenic acid derivatives will be covalently bonded by   a hydrocarbon tether
              to silica  surfaces and their heterogeneous   photooxidations will be studied.
              Objectives are the clarification of   reaction mechanisms, the development of
              new tools for analyzing reaction   mechanisms, the discovery of new oxidizing
              agents, and the development of   new synthetic methods.    Reactions of singlet
               oxygen created by the absorption of light with   compounds containing carbon
              and sulfur will be studied. Methods to   control the indiscriminate nature of
              these reactions by using  molecules   chemically bonded to glass-like surfaces
              will be studied. This project   may lead to a better understanding of the
              reactions of sulfur containing   proteins and naturally occuring organic sulfur
              compounds when they are   exposed to oxygen and sunlight.
