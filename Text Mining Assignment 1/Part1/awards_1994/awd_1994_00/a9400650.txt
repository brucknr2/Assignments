Abstract    :
              Saltman           This award supports research on both Brauer groups and the
              rationality  problem for invariant fields.  The principal investigator is
              specifically interested in the  rationality problem for the center of the
              generic division algebra.  A considerable part of  this proposal concerns all
              these subjects, linked by the unramified cohomology.  The  principal
              investigator will determine if the unramified cohomology can be used to show 
              the center of the generic division algebra is nonrational and if it can be used
              to show  other invariant fields are nonrational.  He will also see if the
              Merkuriev-Suslin theorem  can be made more constructible and if the theory of
              toric varieties can be used to find  good projective models for multiplicative
              invariant fields.           The research supported  is in the general area of
              field theory.  Fields are algebraic structures similar to the  rational
              numbers, the real numbers, and the complex numbers in that each nonzero 
              element has an inverse with respect to multiplication.  Field theory is a rich
              and deep  subject with its historical roots arising from the early attempts to
              systematically  describe the zeros of polynomials. ***
