Abstract    :
              Gao  9400565          Based on the complementarity theory developed by  Gao- 
              Strang  in 1988-89, the objective of this proposed  research  is  to offer a
              comprehensive study on the duality theory  in  nonsmooth  mechanics and the
              related numerical  methods  for  finite   deformation  systems.  Topics  will 
              include:   (1)  Nonsmooth  plastic flow and structural limit  analysis;  (2) 
              Nonlinear  buckling  analysis for  plates  and  shells;  (3)  Control  problems
              and optimal design of smart materials  and  structures;  (4)  Complementary
              finite  element  method  for  nonsmooth optimization.          Finite
              deformation nonsmooth mechanics has been  found  more  and  more  important
              applications in smart  structural  analysis, civil and aerospace engineering.
              Direct method for  solving nonlinear and nonsmooth systems has always presented
               serious  difficulties for mathematicians and engineers.  The  dual   approach 
              andcomplementary  finite  element   method,  however,  possess a great of
              advantages. We can expect  that  the  results  of  this proposed research  will
               provide  new  insight  to  the  nonsmooth mechanics, variational  methods, 
              finite deformation theory, nonlinear optimization theory and  numerical
              methods.
