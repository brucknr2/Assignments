Abstract    :
              9400326  Johnson      This Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) project
              will  undertake the design, testing, and construction of a prototype 
              instrument for the measurement of bare rock heat flow.  The effort  involves
              building a full-scale temperature sensor array and  deployment bag which will
              be tested on the Juan de Fuca Ridge in  1994.  The effort will be enhanced by
              the development of a new,  state-of-the-art data logger, by the Japanese
              Ridge-Flux group.    The proposal responds to a short-term opportunity to study
              an area  of recent undersea volcanic activity using new technology on a 
              previously attempted technique.  Present models of the cooling of  oceanic
              crust suggest that the convection of hydrothermal fluid  within the upper
              crustal rocks is the primary process of heat  transfer from the mantle to the
              overlying seawater.  This  instrument development effort address a scientific
              deficiency in  the determination of the energy budget of the ocean crust -
              namely  the present inability to measure heat flow where there is no  sediment
              cover.
