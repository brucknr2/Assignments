Abstract    :
              9400170  Appelquist       This grant is for the latest in a series of
              conferences held  yearly at the Aspen Center since 1985.  The one-week session
              in  January has as its subject "Particle Physics Before the Year  2000".  Both
              theoretical and experimental presentations are made.  Issues discussed are of
              greatest current interest in particle  physics, e.g. electroweak interactions,
              symmetry breaking and CP  violation.  The setting provides an opportunity for
              close  interaction among theorists and experiments particularly  hospitable to
              younger scientists.  ***
