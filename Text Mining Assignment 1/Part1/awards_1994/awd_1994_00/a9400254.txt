Abstract    :
              9400254  Clark  Research supported by this grant is under the auspices of the
              Arctic Systems Science (ARCSS) Global Change Research Program and is jointly
              sponsored by the Division of Ocean Sciences and the Office of Polar Programs. 
              The research will be centered around a unique and intensive, multidisciplinary
              research expedition to parts of the Arctic Ocean that have never been
              extensively studied.  The 1994 U.S./Canada Arctic Ocean Section is a
              collaborative effort with Canada that will involve approximately 60 scientists
              on a Canadian and a U.S. icebreaker during summer 1994.  NSF-funded projects
              will focus on hydrography, biology, paleo-, and sea-ice studies.  Data
              collected will be amongst the first ever from several regions of the Arctic
              Ocean and will be highly relevant to improving our understanding of how the
              Arctic is an indicator of changing global climate conditions and how it affects
              the physical, chemical, and biological features of the more temperate oceans
              and regions.    This specific research effort involves the study of rare-earth
              element (REE) and Nd isotope systematics in order to gain insights on the
              interplay of ocean chemistry, biology, and physics.  REE, and Nd isotope
              measurements will be obtained from sediment and water samples collected during
              the cruise and will be used to determine the origin of different water masses
              comprising the Arctic Ocean.  Information will also be derived on the origin
              and maintenance of the seawater stratification, mixing processes, circulation,
              and biogeochemical processes.  In addition, these data will allow the Arctic
              Ocean to be placed in context with other existing REE and Nd isotope data from
              the sub-Arctic oceans and to be integrated into existing global, inter-oceanic
              circulation models.  Analysis of ice-borne and seabed sediments for Pb, REE,
              and Nd-Pb-Sr isotopes will allow integration of Late Cenozoic Arctic Ocean
              sediment geochemistry to the current understanding of sediment sources and
              dispersal in the Arctic Ocean.  ***
