Abstract    :
              9400511   Nation                  This research is concerned with the study of
              the equational  theory of finite lattices and the structure of free lattices.  
              These problems are related because questions about lattice  varieties can often
              be interpreted as problems in free lattices.   The first objective of this work
              is to determine which finitely  generated equational classes of lattices have a
              term rewrite  system.  The second objective is to find an algorithm for 
              determining all lattice varieties which cover a given finitely  generated
              lattice variety.  The principal investigator will also  study which ordered
              sets can be embedded in free lattices, and  which lattices are sublattices of
              free lattices.                 Lattices are discrete mathematical objects with
              a structure  reflecting to some extent the structure of set theory or logic.  
              This very weak structure means that lattices can be found in many  mathematical
              environments.  It also means that problems are easy  to state, hard to solve
              and of a very general nature.  The  results of this work will impact many areas
              of mathematics,  computer science, the social sciences and business management.
