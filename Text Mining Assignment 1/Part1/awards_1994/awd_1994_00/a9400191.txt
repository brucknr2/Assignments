Abstract    :
              9400191   Alladi        This award funds the research of Professor Krishnaswami 
              Alladi in partition theory.  Prof. Alladi will try to apply a new  technique
              that he developed in joint work with Prof. Basil Gordon  to five problems.  He
              will study a partition theorem mf Gollnitz,  a recent result of Capparelli, the
              q-Gauss identities,  and the  quintuple product identity.        This work is
              in the general field of analytic number theory  and in particular partition
              theory.  At its most basic level  partition theory studies the question,  how
              many different ways  can one number be written as the sum of smaller numbers? 
              This  question becomes a part of analytic number theory when answers to  this
              question are encoded into mathematical functions.  This  allows mathematicians
              to apply the analysis techniques of  calculus.  The idea of using continuous
              methods to investigate  discrete objects  is two centuries old, but with the
              work of the  modern analytic  number theorists, the field has had a  new 
              rebirth and led to a deeper understanding of partitions of the  whole numbers.
