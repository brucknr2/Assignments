Abstract    :
              9400805  Milgram       Milgram will work mainly in areas related to the geometry
              of  moduli spaces of Yang-Mills instantons on 4-manifolds and  monopoles on
              3-manifolds.  He will focus on the explicit  relations between instantons on
              ruled surfaces (which are now  reasonably well understood) and instantons on
              general algebraic  surfaces.  Cohen will emphasize Floer homology and a
              conjectured  Floer homotopy theory.  S. Kerckhoff will primarily study the 
              deformation spaces of hyperbolic structures on 3-manifolds, with  particular
              attention to problems of degeneration at the  boundaries.       Recent
              interactions between mathematics and physics  have brought new ideas and
              problems into mathematics related in  part to the physicists' desire better to
              understand quantum field  theory.  Among the mathematical results of this
              interaction have  been extensive new information about the geometry of 3- and 
              4-dimensional spaces, including counterexamples to basic  conjectures and new
              structure results.  The major focus of this  project is to apply much more
              advanced results from deep,  well-developed areas of mathematics, such as
              algebraic topology  and homotopy theory, to these new ideas and problems, as
              well as  to related questions.  ***
