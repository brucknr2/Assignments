Abstract    :
                9400642  Wagner  This award will support the technical infrastructure of the
              Center of Computational Ecology,  which in turn will help support the
              development of computational models in several areas  represented by the
              researchers at this center.  The group is involved in developing, 
              implementing, validating, and distributing multiscale simulation models in
              biological  research.  One of the key difficulties in understanding biological
              systems is the fact that every  biological phenomenon involves processes at
              more than one spatial and organizational level  and that these different
              processes are inextricably linked.  Consequently, to understand and  predict
              the behavior of biological systems, models must be developed and validated that
               simulate complex multiscale biological systems.  The group is involved in
              specific projects  that represent complementary approaches to solving problems
              of multiscale computational  modeling.
