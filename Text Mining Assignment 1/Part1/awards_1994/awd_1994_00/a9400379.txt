Abstract    :
              The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center  (MRSEC) at the University
              of Chicago supports interactive  research in four major groups covering a broad
              area of  condensed matter and materials science.    Researchers in the group
              concerned with surface dynamics  seek to develop an improved molecular-level
              understanding of  interfacial phenomena over a range from relatively simple 
              atomic adsorbates to complex molecular systems.  Investigators in the group
              focused on disordered materials  attempt to elucidate the means by which
              macroscopic order  can emerge from microscopic disorder. The group 
              investigating mesoscale structure and response addresses a  broad class of
              technologically important materials whose  fundamental behavior is dominated by
              the physics and  chemistry of constituents at the mesoscopic length scale.  The
              group of researchers involved with the investigation of  the macroscopic
              dynamics of materials combines experiment,  theory and computer simulation to
              explore macroscopic motion  within materials and moving phase boundaries. 
              These  problems bear on such critical and diverse technological  issues as
              processing of powders, oil recovery,  electrodeposition procedures, and
              oxidation of alloys.    The MRSEC also supports the development, operation and 
              maintenance of shared experimental facilities for materials  research. It
              provides seed funding for exploratory research  and  fosters research
              participation by undergraduates.  The  MRSEC is associated with an educational
              outreach program  with special emphasis on attracting and keeping women and 
              underrepresented minorities in science.  The MRSEC has an  industrial visitors
              program and a newly formed industrial  liaison committee.   There is an active
              research  collaboration with Argonne National Laboratory.  The MRSEC  currently
              involves 25 senior personnel,  10 postdoctoral  research associates, 8
              technical staff members, 21 graduate  students, and 10 undergraduates.   The
              Chicago MRSEC is  directed by Professor Leo Kad anoff.
