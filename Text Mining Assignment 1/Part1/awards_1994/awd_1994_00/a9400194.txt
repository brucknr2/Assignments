Abstract    :
              9400194  TEDROW  This award provides funds to continue an REU Site at the 
              Demographic Research Laboratory at Western Washington University.   Ten
              undergraduates, recruited nationwide, will participate in  "Applied Demographic
              Research on Migration" for two months in the  Summer, 1994.  These students,
              supervised by a project team of  professional demographers, will focus their
              research efforts on  the study of migration profiles and analytical models.  A
              variety  of data files, including the Public Use Microdata Sample, the  1990
              STF's and the Cumulative General Social Survey, will serve  as primary data
              sources for the students.  The program will  include an ethics component
              featuring a two-day workhop with  outstanding ethicists focussing on ethical
              issues in demography  and in student research projects.      This award
              contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to  attract talented
              students into careers in science through active  undergraduate research
              experiences.  ***
