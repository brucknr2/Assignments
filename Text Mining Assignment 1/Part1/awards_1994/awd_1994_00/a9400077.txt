Abstract    :
              9400077  Huque    A two year experimental project has been proposed to generate
              a  data bank for thermal conductivity of material which can  effectively be
              used for modelling Self-Propagating High  Temperature-Synthesis.  Specific
              attention will be paid to the  grain size effects in the compacts in green
              state.  Special  materials of interest would be the family of carbides,
              borides,  silicides, sulphides etc.    %%%    The Principal Investigator has
              proposed to generate a data bank for  thermal conductivity of materials which
              can effectively be used for  modelling the Self-Propagating High-Temperature
              Synthesis.  ***
