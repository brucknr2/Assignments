Abstract    :
              9400833   Larsen        This award funds the investigations of Prof. Michael
              Larsen  into monodromy representations of fundamental groups especially  as
              they arise in number theory.  Prof. Larsen will attempt to  compute monodromy
              groups in particular cases and study variations  caused by changes in the base
              data.  He would like to be able to  construct examples where the monodromy
              group is prescribed  beforehand,  an inverse problem based on the invariants of
              the  induced representation.         This is research in the field of
              arithmetic algebraic   geometry, a subject that combines the techniques of
              algebraic   geometry and number theory. In its original formulation,  
              algebraic geometry treated figures that could be defined in the   plane by the
              simplest equations, namely polynomials. Number   theory started with the whole
              numbers and such questions as   divisibility of one whole number by another.
              These two subjects,  seemingly so far apart, have in fact influenced each other
              from   the earliest times, but in the past quarter century the mutual  
              influence has increased greatly. The result has been an increased 
              understanding of both areas of mathematics.
