Abstract    :
              9400996  Allen       Although individually small in stature, tropical mosses 
              constitute major portions of forest biomass and provide food and  shelter to
              numerous invertebrate organisms.  The taxonomic  inventory of mosses and
              understanding of their genealogical or  phylogenetic relationships are at a
              primitive level, largely  because so few scientists study these plants.  In a
              project  designed to describe and classify all the mosses of Central  America,
              Dr. Robert Allen of the Missouri Botanical Garden  continues with the second
              phase of a projected four-volume  inventory of tropical mosses.  An estimated
              200-300 species are to  be treated, with identification keys, illustrations of
              diagnostic  morphological features, scientific nomenclature, and notes on 
              habitat and geographical distribution for each.       Taxonomic description and
              classification of Central American  mosses will provide the foundation for
              critical ecological and  biogeographic studies of the region.  The moss flora
              will be  published first in English, then translated into a Spanish edition.  
              Natural history collections at select Central American institutions  will be
              enhanced as well, and information is being databased for  eventual electronic
              transmission.
