Abstract    :
              Professor Debarre will investigate geometric properties of  abelian varieties.
              In particular, he will study the topology and  geometry of covers of abelian
              varieties of small degree. He also  intends to continue his study of the
              Schottky problem.  This is research in the field of algebraic geometry.
              Algebraic  geometry is one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but  one
              which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past  quarter-century. In its
              origin, it treated figures that could be  defined in the plane by the simplest
              equations, namely  polynomials.  Nowadays the field makes use of methods not
              only  from algebra, but from analysis and topology, and conversely is  finding
              application in those fields as well as in physics,  theoretical computer
              science, and robotics.
