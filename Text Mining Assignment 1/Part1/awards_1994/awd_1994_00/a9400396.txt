Abstract    :
              The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center  (MRSEC) at Harvard
              University supports interactive research  in four major groups covering a broad
              area of condensed  matter and materials science.    Researchers in the group
              focused on new materials are  concerned with synthesis, characterization, and
              theoretical  studies of superconductors and superhard carbon-based  materials. 
              Investigators in the group concerned with  interfaces  focus on collaborative
              aspects of interface  science including organic monolayers and thin films,
              wetting  and nucleation, mechanisms of interface motion in amorphous 
              materials, and characterization of semiconductor surfaces.  The group
              investigating electronic and photonic  nanostructures addresses size effects
              and new electronic and  photonic phenomena in a variety of materials.  The
              group of  researchers involved with design and manufacturing issues  aims to
              develop a new paradigm for choosing the optimum  materials and processes
              necessary to manufacture a  component.    The MRSEC also supports the
              development, operation and  maintenance of shared experimental facilities for
              materials  research. It provides seed funding for exploratory research,  has a
              minority fellowship program, and  fosters research  participation by
              undergraduates.  The MRSEC administers an  industrial outreach program which is
              likely to be enhanced  by the activities in design and manufacturing.  The
              MRSEC  currently supports 23 senior investigators, 12 postdoctoral  research
              associates, 9 technical staff members, 16 graduate  students, and 8
              undergraduates.  The Harvard MRSEC is  directed by Professor Frans Spaepen.
