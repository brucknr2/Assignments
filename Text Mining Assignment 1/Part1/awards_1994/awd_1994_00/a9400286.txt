Abstract    :
              9360638  Wang  Brimrose proposes to research and demonstrate novel integrated
              photorefractive waveguide-based photonic devices including optical amplifiers
              and homodyne detectors.  They have advantages of significantly increased
              sensitivity, integrated waveguide format, rigid, stable and self-alignment. 
              The sensitivity of these devices are several order of magnitudes higher than
              their convention bulk counterparts.  The mechanism of the high sensitivity is
              two fold: (1)The optical signals are confirmed in films on the order of a few
              microns thick in photorefractive waveguides.  Thus even with low signal energy,
              the energy density can still be very high; and (2)The interaction length of the
              underlying mechanism response for amplification and homodyning are much longer
              than in the bulk case where the interaction length is limited by the beam
              width.  The index change An for 1.0uj/cm3 absorbed energy will be increased
              from 0.51x10-6 in the bulk format to greater than 500x10-6 in the integrated
              guided-wave format.  Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that homodyne
              detection using photorefractive two-beam coupling can increase the
              signal-to-noise ratio by 3 dB.    These devices will be fabricated from
              photorefractive II-VI semiconductor materials, CdTe:V and ZnTe:V, which have
              been extensive worked on for over five years and Brimrose is the only
              manufacturer in the world.  They have photorefractive sensitivity between 0.6
              um to 1.5 um which is perfectly matched with laser diodes and optical
              communication wavelengths.  ***
