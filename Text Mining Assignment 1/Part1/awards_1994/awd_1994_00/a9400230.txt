Abstract    :
              9400230  Semmes       The proposed research involves a combination of harmonic 
              analysis and geometric measure theory that is somewhat  complicated.
              Conventionally one likes to ask questions about the  relationship between the
              geometry of a set in a Euclidean space  and the analysis of functions and
              linear operators associated to  this set. One can also consider the geometry
              and complexity of  sets in Euclidean spaces for their own sake, and look for
              methods  to detect when a set has some nice interesting structure, e.g.,  when
              it can be parametrized in a nice way with estimates. For  this latter endeavor
              harmonic analysis has a slightly  indirect relevance, by providing guidance for
              what "interesting  structure" might mean, as well as useful techniques.
              However,  many of the traditional tools of harmonic analysis do not apply  in
              this inherently nonlinear setting, and in fact there are  results in the
              geometric setting whose counterparts in classical  analysis are false.      
              The  work  of  Semmes involves the  interplay   between measure  theory,
              geometry and analysis. Given a set of  points  in space, one can ask whether it
              can be measured. In the  case  of  a one  dimensional  set, this is the
              question  of   whether  it  has finite  length. This can be a very subtle 
              question  in  analysis. Classical  answers to this question often  involve
              boundedness  of certain  operations on spaces of  functions on the  set.  In 
              this project answers to the question  of "measurability" will be sought where 
              the  classical  approaches cannot work. This  will  involve replacing  the 
              classical operations by more complicated nonlinear operations.  ***
