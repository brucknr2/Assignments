Abstract    :
              9400875  Sundaram       This award funds the research of Professor Sheila
              Sundaram  in algebraic combinatorics.  In particular Prof. Sundaram will  the
              homology of subposets of the partition lattice.  She will try  to establish
              that Whitney homology modules associated to certain  posets are in fact
              permutation modules.  This conjecture has  implications regarding refinements
              of the tangent and Genocchi  numbers.       This research falls in the broad
              category of combinatorics,   which is one of the most active fields in today's
              mathematics. At  its roots, combinatorics is the study of systematic counting
              and  arrangement.  Counting can be incredibly difficult when the  objects are
              difficult to list,  and combinatorists look for  general methods for overcoming
              these difficulties.  Today's  combinatorics makes use of a wide variety of the
              most advanced  and modern mathematical techniques.  Although its roots go back 
              several centuries, the field has had an explosive development in  the past few
              decades.  This growth comes from its importance in   communications and
              information technology and from the success of  modern techniques to problems
              of counting.          ***
