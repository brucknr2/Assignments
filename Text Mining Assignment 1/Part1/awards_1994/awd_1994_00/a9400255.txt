Abstract    :
              9400255  Briggs  Research supported by this grant is under the Arctic Systems
              Science (ARCSS) Global Change Research Program and the Polar Earth Science
              Program in the Office of Polar Programs.  The research will be centered around
              a unique and intensive, multidisciplinary research expedition to parts of the
              Arctic Ocean that have never been extensively studied.  The 1994 U.S./Canada
              Arctic Ocean Section is a collaborative effort with Canada that will involve
              approximately 60 scientists on a Canadian and a U.S. icebreaker during summer
              1994.  NSF-funded projects will focus on hydrography, biology, paleo-, and
              sea-ice studies.  Data collected will be amongst the first ever from several
              regions of the Arctic Ocean and will be highly relevant to improving our
              understanding of how the Arctic is an indicator of changing global climate
              conditions and how it affects the physical, chemical, and biological features
              of the more temperate oceans and regions.    This work is a component of the
              collaborative paleoceanographic program.  Work will involve research on
              ostracodes contained in sediment samples to be collected during the Section as
              well as from existing surface sediments collected by the Geological Survey of
              Canada, from several other Arctic Ocean sites, including the northern Canadian
              Arctic Archipelago.  Ostracodes are small calcareous bivalved crustaceans, and
              some benthic marine ostracodes are attuned, within narrow limits, to several
              environmental variables, the most important of which are temperature, salinity,
              dissolved O2, nutrients, and substrate.  Their distribution on the sea floor
              therefore reflects bottom water conditions, making ostracodes ideal monitors of
              water mass changes and circulation anomalies through geological time.  Previous
              investigations have suggested that ostracodes are useful for paleoceanographic
              reconstructions of water-mass history.  This work will provide a better
              understanding of the relationship between modern ostracodes, water masses, and
              Arctic bathymetry; of  the relationship between intermediate depth and deep
              water ostracodes and Atlantic and Pacific faunas, and of faunal history and
              inferred ocean history during the Holocene, the Last Glaciation, and possibly
              the whole of the Brunhes Epoch.
