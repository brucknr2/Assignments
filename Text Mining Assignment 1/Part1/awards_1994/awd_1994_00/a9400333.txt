Abstract    :
              9400333  Carey  Recent reports of world-wide declines and extinctions of
              amphibian populations have raised questions about the relation of environmental
              change to the demise of certain amphibian species.  If these species are being
              harmed by man-made change, amphibians may prove to be excellent "harbingers of
              decay" and indicators of ecosystem stress.  The causes of amphibian
              populational declines have not been conclusively demonstrated.  %%%  The
              following working hypothesis is presented to explain how environmental change
              might cause the demise of amphibian populations.  1.   A sublethal change in
              one factor, or multiple change(s) in several factors, acting  singly of
              synergistically, occurs in the environment of these amphibians.  2. The
              environmental change either directly suppresses function of immune system,  or
              indirectly affects immune function by eliciting an immunosuppressive 
              neuroendocrine response.  3. This depression of immune function, coupled with
              the additional suppressive  effects of seasonally-associated cold body
              temperatures on the abilities of  ectothermic immune systems to resist disease,
              leads to increased susceptibility to  opportunistic pathogens such as Aeromonas
              hydrophila.  In turn, susceptibility  results in subsequent disease, death of
              the individual, and demise of the population.  %%%  Parts 2 and 3 of the
              working hypothesis will be tested in the project period in Bufo b. boreas, Rana
               yavapiensis, Bufo marinus, and Ambystoma tigrinum.  The difference between our
              approach and that of others working to find the causes of amphibian declines is
              that others are looking to find an environmental change severe enough to kill
              amphibians directly, while our approach evaluates the role of smaller,
              sublethal changes sufficient to cause suppression of immune function and
              disease.
