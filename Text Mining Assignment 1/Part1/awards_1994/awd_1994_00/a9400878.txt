Abstract    :
                       This award to James Bower will support continued development  and
              distribution of A General Neural Simulation System (GENESIS)  for Computational
              Neurobiology.  The specific extensions and  further development include the
              release of a new version of the  software, continued efforts to develop
              versions of the package on  parallel machines, continued documentation,
              development of an  interface between GENESIS and the simulator NEURON, and the 
              extension of the development of simulator performance measures to  network.  In
              addition, this award will allow new collaborations  with the Pittsburgh
              Supercomputing Center and the Scientific  Visualization Laboratory at the
              University of Illinois Chicago.  This package will be used by both the research
              and the  educational communities.  The award is being supported by the 
              Computational Neuroscience Program, the Numeric, Symbolic, and  Geometric
              Computation Program, and the Computational Biology  Program.
