Abstract    :
              This award supports work on algebraic groups.  The principal  investigator will
              study several aspects of the representation  theory of semisimple algebraic
              groups over fields of prime  characteristic, with applications to finite groups
              of Lie type.   The program of Lusztig relating quantum groups and modular 
              representations is of primary concern, with emphasis on injective  modules and
              tilting modules.  Representation arising from the  cohomology of line budnles
              on flag varieties pose related  problems; a major question here concerns the
              relationship with  Kazhdon-Luztig polynomials for the affine Weyl group.  The
              study  of algebraic groups should provide further insight into  representations
              of associated finite simple groups, and related  cohomology.             This
              research is in the general area of algebraic groups.   Roughly speaking, a
              group which satisfies a polynomial identity  is an algebraic group.  The
              proposed research falls under two  broad headings: cohomology of line bundles
              on flag varieties, and  injective modules.  Advances along these lines would
              both shed  light on Lusztig's conjecture, as well as point the way beyond  it.
