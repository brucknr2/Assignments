Abstract    :
              9400251  Walsh  Research supported by this grant is under the auspices of the
              Arctic Systems Science (ARCSS) Global Change Research Program and is jointly
              sponsored by the Division of Ocean Sciences and the Office of Polar Programs. 
              The research will be centered around a unique and intensive, multidisciplinary
              research expedition to parts of the Arctic Ocean that have never been
              extensively studied.  The 1994 U.S./Canada Arctic Ocean Section is a
              collaborative effort with Canada that will involve approximately 60 scientists
              on a Canadian and a U.S. icebreaker during summer 1994.  NSF-funded projects
              will focus on hydrography, biology, paleo-, and sea-ice studies.  Data
              collected will be amongst the first ever from several regions of the Arctic
              Ocean and will be highly relevant to improving our understanding of how the
              Arctic is an indicator of changing global climate conditions and how it affects
              the physical, chemical, and biological features of the more temperate oceans
              and regions.    This work is a component of the collaborative biology program. 
              Information will be provided on the spatial optical variability along the 
              cruise track by measuring beam attenuation at 660 nm using a Sea Tech 25 cm
              pathlength transmissometer.  Spatial distribution of optical properties with
              respect to fronts, currents, and other biohydrographic features will be
              assessed.  These measurements will augment information derived from concurrent
              biological, chemical, and physical data collected during the cruise.  The work
              will provide an understanding of the role that suspended particles play in
              Arctic Ocean productivity and air-sea-ice interactions.  In addition, data will
              used to explain the role of nepheloid layers in lateral transport of shelf
              productivity to the slope and basin and in benthic fluxes.  ***
