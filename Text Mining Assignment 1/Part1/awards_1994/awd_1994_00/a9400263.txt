Abstract    :
              9400263  Wigen    Technical abstract:  Chaos is a complicated and often
              undesirable  behavior.  The ability to control chaotic behavior is a special 
              attribute that may be beneficial to many applications.  The chaotic  attractor
              includes an infinite number of unstable orbits.  By  applying a well defined
              perturbation to a system variable it is  possible to control the behavior of a
              chaotic system by stabilizing  one of these unstable orbits.  By modifying the
              perturbation the  selected orbit may be varied permitting a variety of orbits
              that  are not readily available in a conventional linear system.  It is 
              proposed to utilize perturbation of the magnetic field to control  the chaotic
              behavior observed in the ferromagnetic resonance  signal.    Non-technical
              abstract:  The complex behavior of a chaotic system  is commonly known and
              widely recognized in many systems from  bridges and the weather to heart
              fibrillation and brain signals.   In many systems significant effort is made to
              eliminate the  conditions that lead to this chaotic behavior.  However, with
              the  recent evolution of "controlling chaos" it is possible to put the  system
              into one of a number of unstable behavioral patterns that  are present in a
              chaotic system.  By applying an appropriate  control signal it is possible to
              stabilize these desired patterns.   This behavior leads to an increased
              flexibility in many systems  giving rise to new applications and environments.
