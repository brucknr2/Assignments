Abstract    :
              9400060  Koehler      This award is under the International Junior Investigator 
              and Postdoctoral Fellows Program, which enables U.S.  scientists and engineers
              to conduct three to twelve months  of research abroad at research centers of
              proven excellence.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint 
              research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities,  expertise and
              experimental conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month
              postdoctoral research  visit by Dr.Carla  M. Koehler of  Iowa State University
              to  work with Dr. Gottfried Schatz at the University of Basel in  Basel,
              Switzerland.    This research proposal concerns fundamental questions of  cell
              biology related to biogenesis and protein exchanges.  In particular, it intends
              to characterize the mitochondrial  outer membrane import machinery in
              Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  Dr. Koehler will use genetic techniques to clone
              suppressors  of one mitochondrial import receptor.  Specifically, the  goal  is
              to see how Mas20p and Mas70p, two import receptors,  function as receptors. 
              Use of the two hybrid system and  biochemical techniques will reveal whether
              they interact  with each other and imported precursors.  Other proteins 
              located at the import site and in the cytosol will be  identified by screening
              a cDNA library using the two-hybrid  system, and the interaction between
              cytosolic factors and  the receptors will be examined further using biochemical
              and  biophysical  methods.  This research is likely to advance  current
              understanding of events at the cell membrane. ***
