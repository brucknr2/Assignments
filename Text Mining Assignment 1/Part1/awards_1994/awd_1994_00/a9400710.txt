Abstract    :
              9400710  Gans         This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral 
              Dissertation Research Program.  It is a study of women immigrants  and the New
              York City garment industry, employing comparative  research on two types of
              sewing shops: those of the Chinese who  hire co-ethnics and those of the
              Koreans who hire Latinos.  This  will make possible generalizations about the
              broader categories  of race, ethnicity, and gender, and how these categories
              relate  to the larger economic structure of the New York City economy.  
              Participant observation and interviews will be conducted to  understand how
              different immigrants gain jobs, why particular  groups have access to certain
              jobs, and how ethnicity may or may  not be used as a resource.  %%%       This
              research will contribute to the sociology of  immigration, of ethnic groups,
              and of urban careers.  It  addresses sociological theories of racial-economic
              adaptation,  that are based on concepts of economic restructuring, social 
              networks, and ethnic succession.  In addition to the scientific  gains to be
              achieved by the research, this award will materially  assist a highly promising
              student in completing research for the  Ph.D. dissertation.  Thus it
              contributes to the future scientific  manpower of the nation and the thorough
              training of the next  generation of social scientists.    ***
