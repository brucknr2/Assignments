Abstract    :
              9400632  Holzenthal   This request seeks funding, primarily in the form of
              graduate student research assistantships and summer faculty salary, to complete
              systematics research and education on the Trichoptera, or caddisfly, fauna of
              Costa Rica and the Neotropics.  An important new component of the project will
              be emphasis on the graduate training of a Costa Rican in systematic entomology.
               Information and data generated through the project, specifically the
              English-language text of the manual and specimen level locality and taxonomic
              information, will be entered on a database and made available over the Internet
              through Gopher.  Caddisflies are closely related to butterflies and moths and
              are best known, especially by those interested in fly fishing, for the cases
              and capture nets constructed by their aquatic larvae.  Caddisfly larvae are
              ubiquitous in fresh waters worldwide, but are especially diverse in unpolluted
              rivers and steams.  Larvae are important in aquatic food chains and are used as
              biological indicators of the well-being of freshwater habitats.  The objectives
              of this research are to determine the full diversity and distribution of the
              caddisfly fauna of Costa Rica and to publish a species-level, Spanish-language
              manual of the fauna.  When completed, this manual will be the first of its kind
              in Latin America.  Since the manual will be based on revisionary taxonomic and
              phylogenetic research of monophyletic taxa, its production will extend benefits
              beyond Costa Rica to trichopterology and the study of Neotropical insects in
              general.  The human resources, manual, and database developed under this
              project will serve important roles for future research on the taxonomy,
              biology, and conservation of Trichoptera and their habitats in the New World
              tropics.
