Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9400647  A. Haji-Sheikh      The proposal is to explore an inverse
              method for solving three-dimensional heat conduction problems based on Green's
              theorem.  Verification of the method is proposed by both forward solution of
              the inverse problem and by experiment.  Solutions to inverse problems are
              necessary when property data is to be recovered from temperature and/or heat
              flux measurements at surfaces, and accurate three-dimensional methods are not
              available.  The work has application in providing real-time control of spray
              cooling in metallurgical heat treating and the cooling of high temperature
              materials in manufacturing processes as well as in advanced electronic cooling.
