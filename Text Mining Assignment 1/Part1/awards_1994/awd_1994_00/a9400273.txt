Abstract    :
              9400273  Weinstein    The main thrust of the work will be to optimize additives
              for  example platinum and samarium in the 123 superconductors and study  the
              grain size effect on the superconducting properties.  Grain  size of 211 phase,
              cracking of 123 grains under magnetic pressure  and conversion of the magnetic
              stored energy to heat will also be  studies.  The Principal Investigator also
              propose to study  development of characterization of superconductors via
              mapping of  vector trapped field.    %%%    The effects of additive and the
              presence of the second phase on the  superconducting and mechanical properties
              will be studied in the  proposed work.  A vector trapped field method will be
              developed for  the characterization of superconductors.  ***
