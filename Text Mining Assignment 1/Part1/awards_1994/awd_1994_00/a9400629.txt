Abstract    :
              In order to gain a detailed description of the dynamics of  nuclear fusion
              reactions, a cubic array of thallium-doped  cesium iodide  CsI (T1)  detectors
              will be developed.  This  detector array will cover 95% of the space
              surrounding the  reaction and will be able to detect the number, energy, and 
              type of charged-particles emitted by the reaction products.  The array will be
              placed in front of a recoil mass  spectrometer such as the Fragment Mass
              Analyzer at Argonne  National Laboratory or the Recoil Mass Spectrometer at the
               University of Rochester's Nuclear Structure Research  Laboratory.  With such a
              combined detection system, the  total number and type of all particles emitted
              by the short-  lived compound nucleus can be inferred for each nuclear 
              reaction.  The data accumulated by this detection system  will be used to
              investigate the applicability of statistical  decay models in heavy-ion induced
              fusion reactions.  In  particular, the research will attempt to determine what 
              differences exist in  the decay of excited  Dy when it is  formed by three
              different nuclear fusion reactions.  ***
