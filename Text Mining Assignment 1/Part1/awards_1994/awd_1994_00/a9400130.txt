Abstract    :
                Sammis    The goals of the project are twofold, in keeping with the strategy
              of concurrently developing a process and a prototype product.  First, at the
              technical level, the project aims to develop a stable of programs and software
              to coordinate them, a library of video examples, a collection of datasets, a
              pool of exercises, and a base curriculum from which first-rank introductory
              statistics courses can be developed.    Secondly, the project aims to prove the
              process by developing a prototype introductory elementary statistics course. 
              The course would be sufficient for a full test in which students would take the
              entire introductory course from a multimedia workstation.  At the pedagogical
              level, the project aims to develop a coherent design for multimedia statistics
              courses to meet the challenge of integrating text, illustration, video,
              animation, simulation, data visualization, and computation.
