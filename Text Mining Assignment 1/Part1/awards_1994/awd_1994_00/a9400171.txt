Abstract    :
                9400171  Costa      In order to understand how the brain works, it will be 
              necessary to decipher the codes used when one nerve cell  "talks" to another. 
              With this award, Dr. Erminio Costa will  receive support for a symposium on the
              topic of  undrestanding the coding of  information by brain cells.  The
              symposium, titled "Dynamics of Neural Processing", will  be held in Washington
              in June of 1994, and will attract both  senior and junior  researchers from
              around the world.  With  NSF support, Dr. Costa will be able to defray travel 
              expenses for some promising younger neuroscientists.***
