Abstract    :
              9400811  Smith-Lovin          This  is  an award under the Grants for Improving 
              Doctoral  Dissertation  Research program.  It is a study of  how  emotional 
              displays affect how individuals construe ambiguous information in  order   to 
              assess  a  social  situation.   Social  psychological  experiments will be
              conducted in which observers will view actors  on  videotape portraying alleged
              criminals and victims  of  their  crimes.  By varying the emotional tone of the
              statements  of  the  actors,  differences  in  how experimental  subjects 
              assess  the  nature  of  the  criminal  situation and recommend  verdicts  and 
              sentences will be assessed.        Previous  attempts  to  verify  affect 
              control  theory  in  experimental situations have been relatively unsuccessful.
                This  project  will subject predictions of that theory to more rigorous 
              tests.   In  addition,  this  research  should  answer  important  questions 
              about  how members of juries resolve  ambiguities  and  reach   decisions  in 
              criminal  trials.   In  addition  to   the  scientific gains to be achieved by
              the research, this award  will  materially  assist  a  highly  promising 
              student  in  completing  research for the Ph. D. dissertation.  Thus it
              contributes to the  future  scientific  manpower  of  the  nation  and  the 
              thorough  training of the next generation of social scientists.  ***
