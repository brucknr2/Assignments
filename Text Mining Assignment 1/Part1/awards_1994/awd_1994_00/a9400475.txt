Abstract    :
              9400475  Baer  The research consists of creating engineered microstructures of 
              incompatible polymers with up to 8,000 alternating layers of two  polymers. 
              The unique advantages that can be achieved with these  microlayered and
              nanolayered composites will be studied.  A  fundamental study of the
              interactive microdeformation processes  that lead to enhanced mechanical
              properties in microlayers of  thermoplastic polymers will be carried out.  The
              basic physics of  crystallization with simultaneous interdiffusion will be 
              investigated with microlayers of two miscible polymers.  Controlled interfacial
              reaction in microlayers will be studied to  model interfacial effects of
              reactive compatibilization.  New  microlayer and nanolayer composites will be
              made to explore the  feasibility of creating film and sheet materials with
              multiple  functions, including unusual mechanical, optical, and electronic 
              properties.  %%%  This research on layer-multiplying devices that permit
              continuous  melt processing of two polymers into sheet or film with hundreds 
              or thousands of alternating layers will create new opportunities  for
              coextrusion technology.  The unique microlayered and  nanolayered structures
              are used to study fundamental problems in  polymer science, and to create new
              materials with unusual,  coupled properties.
