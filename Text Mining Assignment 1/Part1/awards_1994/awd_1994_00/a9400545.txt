Abstract    :
              9400545  Weber   In western North America the Pezizales Fungi, Ascomycotina) are
              represented by approximately 120 genera an perhaps as many as 450 species which
              include the morels and related cup-fungi (epigeous taxa) and truffles
              (hypogeous taxa).  The order includes important mycorrhizal and saprophytic
              fungi; several are esculents of considerable economic value; a few are
              occasional serious plant pathogens.  The western United States encompasses
              great geologic, topographic, climatic, and floristic diversity which is
              reflected in the apparent diversity of the Pezizales Therein occurring.  This
              project is the  first to attempt to survey and inventory the diversity of
              Pezizalean fungi for the region.  Because no modern taxonomic treatment of this
              order is available for the Western united States (or any other region of North
              America) aids to identifying taxa (dichotomous and synoptic keys) and
              descriptions of known and newly discovered taxa will be prepared.  Goals for
              field work include prospecting for additional diversity, new records, and
              clarifying distribution patterns of known taxa.  An accession-based database is
              being compiled from the major sets of Pezizalean collections deposited in
              regional and national herbaria in the United States; additional records are
              being culled from published references.   The existing collections provide the
              raw material for determining distributions, assessing diversity, and helping to
              identify areas were further field work is needed.  Because of floristic ties
              with Europe, Asia, and other parts of North America, a treatment of western
              North America taxa will be useful throughout much of the Northern Hemisphere.
