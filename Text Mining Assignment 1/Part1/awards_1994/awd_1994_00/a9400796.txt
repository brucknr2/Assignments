Abstract    :
                         This award supports research on the theory of Lie algebras.  The
              principal investigator will work on proving a general Kazhdan-Lusztig
              conjecture for some rings associated to reflection representations of Coxeter
              groups.  It is expected that, for crystallographic Coxeter groups, study of
              these rings and their integral forms will have important consequences for some
              central problems in Lie theory.  The main object of the research is to obtain
              additional information on the structure of these rings and related algebras.   
                         This project is concerned with the study of Lie algebras and , in
              particular, with the Kahzdan-Lusztig polynomials.  The Kahzdan-Lusztig
              polynomial is a combinatorially defined object having deep connections with
              structures in geometry and representation theory.  This work is important both
              in mathematics and physics.
