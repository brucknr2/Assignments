Abstract    :
              9400214  Magid    This award supports a U.S.-Belgium workshop on future
              directions  in affine differential geometry to take place in Leuven and 
              Brussels, Belgium, July 10-12, 1994.  The organizers are Martin  Magid of
              Wellesley College and Leopold Verstraelen of Catholic  University in Leuven,
              Belgium.  Specialists from Germany,  Netherlands, Spain and Russia will
              participate. The purpose of  the workshop is to review new directions in affine
              differential  geometry and identify future research collaborations.  The 
              Europeans have done most of the recent work in this field.   Through this
              workshop, this small group of U.S. researchers will  expand their contacts and
              coordinate their efforts with the  European group.    Affine differential
              geometry is the study of invariants of  submanifolds under the group of affine
              motions.  The subject has  been studied for a long time; however, there has
              been resurgence  of interest in recent years. Recent discoveries now link
              affine  differential geometry to fundamental problems in computer vision  and
              image processing.  The proposed workshop examines these new  directions and is
              expected to stimulate new areas for research.  ***
