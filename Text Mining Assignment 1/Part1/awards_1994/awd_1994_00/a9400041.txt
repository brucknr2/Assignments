Abstract    :
              9400041  Wysk       This project provides a technical pilot phase for testing
              the  utility of one physical manufacturing laboratory called MODELWORLD,  for
              use by many remote researchers.  The information infrastructure  will be
              supported to allow testing of the concept in the research  community.      
              This open manufacturing facility has potential use for  research and education
              in operations research, information  technologies, and flexible/agile
              manufacturing.  This project  offers the potential of linking researchers from
              different regions  around common research interests.
