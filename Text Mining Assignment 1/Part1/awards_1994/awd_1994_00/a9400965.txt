Abstract    :
              9300805  Rosenthal       This project addresses a number of issues in systems
              theory,  interpolation theory and coding theory, all of which involve 
              algebraic properties of the class of all autoregressive systems  of a bounded
              degree. The main objectives of the research are  improved methods for the
              design of stabilizing dynamic feedback  compensators, a better understanding of
              the interplay between  issues of robustness and topological properties of the
              space of  transfer functions, and new methods for constructing classes of 
              convolutional codes with a low complexity and a large free  distance.      
              Many real world systems may be mathematically modeled by so-  called linear
              systems. Two examples of a linear system are  dynamic feedback compensators,
              which are widely used in the  design of feedback controllers, and convolutional
              encoders and  decoders, which are implemented in many data transmission 
              schemes. It is the goal of this project to develop a mathematical  theory which
              will lead to improved design techniques for feedback  controllers of various
              types as well as more efficient  convolutional encoders and decoders.  ***
