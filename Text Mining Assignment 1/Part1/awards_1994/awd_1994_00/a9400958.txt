Abstract    :
              This award supports research on the structure of certain classes  of finite rank
              indecomposable Butler groups,  co-purely-indecomposable modules over a discrete
              valuation ring,  and finitely generated indecomposable modules over pullback 
              rings.  Included are projects for classification by invariants.   Particular
              attention will be devoed to determining finite, tame,  or wild representation
              type for each class considered.  Infinite  dimensional Z-representations will
              be used to investigate  problems revolving around realizations of (nonabelian)
              groups as  automorphism groups of fields.     This project is in the general
              area of abelian group theory.  It  is concerned with the classification of
              abelian groups and the  application of this knowledge to other areas.  Although
              the  classification of finite abelian groups has been well understood  for a
              century, the classification of infinite abelian groups  remains elusive.  This
              research involves this old problem of  classification of the infinite abelian
              groups approached by new  tools from logic and topology.
