Abstract    :
              Fomin       This award funds Professor Sergey Fomin's exploration of new
              relations  between combinatorics and algebra.  A new approach to the theory of
              Schubert and  Grothendieck polynomials based on exponential solutions to the
              Yang-Baxter equations  has suggested new developments in the combinatorics of
              Coxeter groups.  This work  will build on this via symmetric functions, local
              associative algebras and universal  algebra.            This research falls in
              the broad category of combinatorics, which is one of  the most active fields in
              today's mathematics. At its roots, combinatorics is the study  of systematic
              counting.  Counting can be incredibly difficult when the objects are  difficult
              to list,  and combinatorists look for general methods for overcoming these 
              difficulties.  Today's combinatorics makes use of a wide variety of the most
              advanced  and modern mathematical techniques.  Although its roots go back
              several centuries, the  field has had an explosive development in the past few
              decades.  This growth comes  from its importance in communications and
              information technology and from the  success of modern techniques to problems
              of counting. ***
