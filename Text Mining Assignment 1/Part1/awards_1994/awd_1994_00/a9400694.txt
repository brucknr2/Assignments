              Title: Remote Sensing of Large-Scale Air-Sea Heat Fluxes Based on  Ultra
              Precise Measurements of the Atmospheric Kr/N2 Ratio    In this proposal,a
              method is proposed for detecting changes in the  global heat storage in the
              oceans, based on measuring changes in  the relative abundance of atmospheric
              insert gases.  The insert gas  ratios are sensitive to ocean temperature
              through the temperature  dependence of their solubilities in sea water.  The
              heavier insert  gases are preferentially released to the air as ocean warms. 
              The  insert gas ratios Ar/N2 and Xe/N2 are to be measured to a very high 
              precision for feasibility demonstration.    This idea is novel, simple and
              addresses a fundamental issue of  climate variability nd change.
