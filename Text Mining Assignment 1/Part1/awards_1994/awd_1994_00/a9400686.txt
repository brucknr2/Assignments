Abstract    :
              9400686  Strimpel  The Computer Museum in Boston, MA, plans to develop,
              evaluate, and  install a permanent 1800 square meter museum exhibit which is 
              designed to promote public understanding and use of computer  networks.   
              Opening in the winter of 1994-95 The Networked Society museum  exhibit will : 
              1) educate a diverse public audience about the many  applications of computer
              networks; 2) teach principles of computing  science and technology; 3) examine
              topical issues involved in  computer network development and use; 4) help
              increase the number  of American citizens who are educated in the use of
              computer  networks; 5) help increas the number of young peopls who pursue 
              computer networking as a lifelong interest, skill, and career.  The  exhibit
              will impact 1.7 million people in three years and address  issues of technology
              access by educating a broad public audience  with diverse computer literacy
              backgrounds.    Diversification and increase of the the future workforce in 
              mathematics, science, and technology is a primary NSF education  objective. 
              The proposed science museum exhibit project will assist  this and other NSF
              objectives to address issues of technology  transfer and technology access too
              amont the American Public.
