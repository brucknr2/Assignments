Abstract    :
              Willis  9400704    Oregon State University (OSU) requests renewed funding for 
              shipboard technician activities associated with the research vessel WECOMA, a
              177-foot vessel.  The WECOMA is owned by the National Science Foundation and is
              operated by OSU.  In calendar year 1994, the WECOMA will support a total of 109
              days of NSF-funded research.  Most cruises will be located in the Northwest
              Pacific.  The OSU technicians will be responsible for operating and repairing
              instruments while at sea, maintaining instruments ashore and assisting with
              scientific operations as necessary before and after cruises.
