Abstract    :
                      9400316  HUNT  This  dissertation project on the socio-economic
              organization  of  an  East Greenlandic hunting economy, based on the harvesting
               of  seals,  will result in a description and analysis of  an  economy 
              operating  in  both  a  modern industrial market  context  and  a  traditional 
              domestic household economy. The subsequent  analysis  will  contribute  to 
              social theory on  the  impact  of  cash  on  traditional  subsistence economies
              and  the  structure  of  mixed  economies.  In  the  context  of the  1989 
              European  Community's  indefinite  ban  on  the trade of seal skins, the 
              research  will  contribute to our understanding of the adaptive strategies  of 
              a  contemporary Arctic society.  ***
