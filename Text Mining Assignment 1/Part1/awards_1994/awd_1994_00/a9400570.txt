Abstract    :
              9400570  Stickney    Fundamental research studies to investigate thin-layer 
              electrochemical atomic layer epitaxy(ECALE) of compound  semiconductor
              materials will be conducted. In ECALE the  substrate's electrochemical
              potential is used to control the  deposition process.  The phenomenon of
              underpotential deposition,  whereby an atomic layer of an element forms at an
              electrochemical  potential lower than that needed to deposit the element on 
              itself, is exploited and used to deposit compound semiconductor  materials
              atomic layer by layer.  Each deposition cycle consists  of a sequence involving
              solution introduction, potential changes,  and rinsing.  The current research
              effort involves detailed  studies to determine and assess the mechanism of the
              process  through studies of the dependence of deposit composition and 
              structure on the individual steps in the cycle.  Sophisticated  surface science
              tools are used to follow surface coverages,  composition and stoichiometry. 
              Crystallographic structure,  orientation, and quality of electrodeposited films
              as well as  luminescent properties of the films are also routinely 
              characterized.  %%%  Electrodeposition methodologies offer new pathways to the 
              synthesis and processing of compound semiconductors used in  applications such
              as solar cells, telecommunications, and  computing, and provide several
              potential advantages over existing  technologies such as lower temperature
              deposition, and  lower  cost processing because of the known capabilities to
              scale  electrochemical processes to large areas once the underlying 
              fundamental parameters have been identified and understood.  ***
