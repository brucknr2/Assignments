Abstract    :
              9400155  Rabinow  Under the direction of Dr. Paul Rabinow, Mr. Peter Redfield is
               exploring local effects of a global technological system, examining  the
              primary launch facilities of the French and European space  programs at Kourou,
              French Guiana.  The focus of this project is on  the social and cultural
              aspects of the location of this large  center of high technology outside of the
              industrialized world,a nd  its relation to the small multiethnic society
              surrounding it on the  edge of the South American rainforest.  Two interrelated
              questions  guide the investigation:  First, what is the significance of 
              geographic and social location within a technical system, and the  relationship
              of technology to issues of development?  Second, what  are the symbolic roles
              of technology in the cultural evaluation of  development.  Through an
              ethnographic and historical examination of  interactions between international
              technology and a particular  place, the project seeks to compliment recent
              exchanges between  anthropology and social studies of science and technology by
               presenting within a local frame a specific case study of one  extension of
              modern technology beyond the West.  This grant  provides support for
              ethnographic fieldwork in French Guiana as  well as archival research in
              France.  ***
