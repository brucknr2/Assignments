Abstract    :
              9400295  Gutkin       The research covers topics related to the geometric twist 
              maps arising from the classical study of the 3-body problem. This  will be
              studied in relationship to the geometry of billiard  configurations in
              dynamical systems. The dual billiard problem  will also be investigated. The
              research has potential  applications to Hamiltonian mechanics and statistical
              physics.  ***
