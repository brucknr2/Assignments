Abstract    :
              9400889  Keisler       Many existence theorems in analysis have standard proofs 
              using convergence arguments and nonstandard proofs yielding  stronger results
              using lifting arguments.  The investigator has  recently introduced a new
              model-theoretic method of proving  existence theorems, where one can often make
              an easy computation  to obtain an approximate solution to a problem, and then
              invoke a  general forcing theorem to get a harder result giving an exact 
              solution.  The present project will continue development of this  method.      
              For a variety of problems in both pure and applied  mathematics, it is easy to
              show that there are approximate  solutions but very difficult to show that
              there are exact  solutions.  This is typical for stochastic differential 
              equations, optimization problems, and equilibrium problems.   Keisler's new
              approach to such problems, which is justified by a  theorem in mathematical
              logic, can often dramatically simplify  the construction of exact solutions. 
              This method has already  produced several new results and has the potential of
              becoming a  valuable and broadly applicable tool.  ***
