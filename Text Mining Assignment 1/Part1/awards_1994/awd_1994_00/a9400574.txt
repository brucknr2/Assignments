Abstract    :
              9400574  Nakamura       This project involves an investigation into the vertical
               transport of potential vorticity in baroclinic eddies as a means of 
              understanding the tropospheric potential vorticity budget.  The  principal
              investigator is particularly interested in the roles of  the surface
              frontogenesis and tropopause folds as sources/sinks of  potential vorticity as
              well as the rate of exchange between the  troposphere and stratosphere in storm
              track regions.  The research  will involve the use of several idealized
              two-dimensional and a  three dimensional model to look the processes by which
              transport  occurs and an analysis of a year long model simulation of the 
              general circulation done with a state-of-the-art model to assess  the
              statistics of potential vorticity variability.  This research  is important for
              understanding atmospheric general circulation and  may provide important
              insights into tropospheric-stratospheric  exchanges and the transport of
              anthropogenic gases into the  stratosphere.  ***
