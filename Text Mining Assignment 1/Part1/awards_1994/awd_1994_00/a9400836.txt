Abstract    :
              Harbater        This award supports the work of David Harbater on Galois covers
              of algebraic  curves.  Prof. Harbater's work involves number theory and
              geometry.  He intends to  use his recently established result, Abhyankar's
              conjecture, to use patching techniques  to construct Galois Covers of curves.  
                   This is research primarily in the field of algebraic geometry.  This field
              has had a   revolutionary flowering in the past quarter century as techniques
              from number theory  and algebra have found geometric application. Algebraic
              geometry is the study of  curves that can be defined in the plane by  the
              simplest equations, namely polynomials.  Galois covers of curves are particular
              examples that have strong symmetries.  The  techniques of algebraic geometry
              now find application in such diverse fields as physics,  theoretical computer
              science, and  robotics.    ***
