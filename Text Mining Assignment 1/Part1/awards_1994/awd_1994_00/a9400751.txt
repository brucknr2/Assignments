Abstract    :
              Rigsby  9400751                                    In this project the PIs will
              determine the O, C, Sr, and  Pb-isotopic composition of carbonates recovered
              from the Middle  Valley of the northern JdF at ODP Leg 139. They will also
              perform  whole-core radiography to determine textural variations downhole.  The
              objective is to obtain past and existing thermal profiles,  fluid advection,
              and sources of metals in sediments of past and  present hydrothermal system.
              They also wish to investigate the  sulfide ore deposition in these sediments.
              The PIs' and their  collaborators' ultimate goal is to develop models of
              hydrothermal  fluid circulation and chemical exchange between fluids and 
              sediments through time. A second Leg is now being planned (along  with USGS
              collaborators) to drill the Middle Valley sediments to  specifically examine
              the problem of sulfide mineralization.
