Abstract    :
              940577  Nevai       This project is concerned with mathematical research in 
              approximation theory, orthogonal polynomials and related areas of  analysis. 
              The work involves extremal problems, ordinary and  generalized polynomial
              inequalities, difference and differential  equations, spectral theory of real,
              complex and matrix-valued  tridiag  gonal (Jacobi) and banded matrices,
              Toeplitz and Hankel  and Hilbert space operators.  Work will also continue on
              the  development of software directed at analyzing the numerical  aspects of
              orthogonal polynomials.  Specifics of the research  include investigations into
              conditions on assuring boundedness  for solutions of homogeneous and
              nonhomogeneous perturbations  oflinear difference equations in terms of their
              unperturbed  counterparts.  The ratio and comparative asymptotics of extremal 
              problems involving weighted best approximation of monomials by  lower degree
              polynomials will be taken up.  Efforts to understand  the connection between a
              Jacobi matrix and its spectral measure  and its analogues on the unit circle
              will also be made.  Work  will be done extending recent results on the
              asymptotic behavior  of Christoffel functions to measures in the complex plane
              and on  generalized polynomials and their suitability as means of 
              approximation.        Approximation theory and especially the theory of
              orthogonal  polynomials has fruitful connections with many branches of 
              mathematics such as differential equations, operator theory,  numerical
              integration, continued fractions and control theory, to  name a few.  These
              subjects have received strong impulses from  the theory of orthogonal
              polynomials in the past and this process  continues with increasing vigor.  ***
