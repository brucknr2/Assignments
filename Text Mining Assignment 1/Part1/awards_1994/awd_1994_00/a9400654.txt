Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9400654  Incropera     The proposed study seeks to experimentally
              and theoretically delineate transport phenomena related to a processing
              technique which uses intense, localized sources of heat to augment conventional
              machining of ceramic materials. Specifically, thermally enhanced machining
              (TEM) processes will be studied for turning operations involving integration of
              a lathe with existing CO2 laser or plasma arc sources to machine cylindrical
              specimens of silicon nitride, zirconia and alumina-zirconia.     Theoretical
              treatments of TEM processes will be used to delineate the role of pertinent
              physical mechanisms. Models will consider localized heating at and convection
              heat transfer from the workpiece surface, conduction within the workpiece,
              friction at the tool-chip interface, and/or plastic flow. Supporting
              experiments will also be performed to determine flow and convection heat
              transfer conditions at a simulated or actual workpiece surface. On-line
              monitoring will include sensing of workpiece and tool temperatures and cutting
              forces for a wide range of system operating parameters and heat source
              conditions. Off-line measurements will also be used to determine the residual
              stress, tool wear, microstructure and hardness distribution in the machined
              surface. The objective of the theoretical and experimental studies is to obtain
              an improved understanding of underlying physical mechanisms for TEM processes
              and to establish a range of suitable operating conditions.
