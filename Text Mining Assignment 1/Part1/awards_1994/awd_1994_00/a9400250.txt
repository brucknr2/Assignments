Abstract    :
              9400250  Baker  Research supported by this grant is under the auspices of the
              Arctic Systems Science (ARCSS) Global Change Research Program and is jointly
              sponsored by the Division of Ocean Sciences and the Office of Polar Programs. 
              The research will be centered around a unique and intensive, multidisciplinary
              research expedition to parts of the Arctic Ocean that have never been
              extensively studied.  The 1994 U.S./Canada Arctic Ocean Section is a
              collaborative effort with Canada that will involve approximately 60 scientists
              on a Canadian and a U.S. icebreaker during summer 1994.  NSF-funded projects
              will focus on hydrography, biology, paleo-, and sea-ice studies.  Data
              collected will be amongst the first ever from several regions of the Arctic
              Ocean and will be highly relevant to improving our understanding of how the
              Arctic is an indicator of changing global climate conditions and how it affects
              the physical, chemical, and biological features of the more temperate oceans
              and regions.    This work is a component of the collaborative
              paleooceanographic program.  A climatic history of the Arctic Basin will be
              reconstructed by measuring the distribution within the sediments and certain
              chemical characteristics of the exoskeleton of an abundant zooplankton animal. 
              Ostracodes secrete shells rapidly, thereby recording instantaneous physical and
              chemical properties of the surrounding water.  This combined with frequent
              molts, definable magnesium-calcite compositions, and sensitive analytical
              methods make them a prime candidate for recording paleoceanography in cored
              sediments.    Ostracode valves from sediments in piston and box cores will be
              separated by washing over a sieve, identified, and subjected to elemental and
              stable isotopic analysis.  Calcium will be measured using flame atomic
              absorption spectrophotometry while strontium and magnesium will be quantified
              by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometry.  Approximately 1,000
              such measurements will be made in an effort to reconstruct  deep Arctic Ocean
              paleocirculation and bottom water paleotemperatures, and to relate these
              factors to paleoproductivity, dissolved oxygen, sea ice coverage, and other
              parameters of the period from the last glacial maximum to the present.  ***
