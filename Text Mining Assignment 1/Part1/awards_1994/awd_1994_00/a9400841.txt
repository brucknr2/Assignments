Abstract    :
              940841  Felder       The main goal of the proposed activity is to give an 
              explicit description of conformal blocks on Riemann surfaces, as  a space of
              solutions of a system of differential equations,  generalizing the
              Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations. Properties of  the equations and their
              solutions will be investigated. In  particular, integral representations of the
              solutions will be  calculated, with applications to the topology of
              configuration  spaces on surfaces, invariants of three-dimensional manifolds, 
              and the theory of quantum groups and integrable systems.       Conformal Field
              Theory finds its origin in the physics of  surface at critical temperature, and
              string theory, a unified  model of particle interactions. The object of this
              research is  the mathematical structure of Conformal Field Theory. This theory 
              explicitly associates a mathematical object called a complex  vector space of
              "conformal blocks" with equations that model  physical systems.  ***
