Abstract    :
              9400698  ALLDREDGE      A new class of large, abundant particles has recently
              been  discovered which exist as transparent films, sheets and strings in 
              seawater.  These transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) appear to  be formed
              from dissolved polysaccharides excreted by phytoplankton  and bacteria.  The
              existence of microbial exudates acting as large,  discrete particles rather
              than as dissolved molecules as a coatings  on other particles has far reaching
              implications for carbon  cycling, microbial processes, food web structure, and 
              transformations of organic matter in the ocean, but because of  their recent
              discovery, the significance of these particles is  largely unknown. This
              research will conduct preliminary studies to  elucidate the potential
              significance of these invisible particles  to several oceanographic processes. 
              These studies will 1)  determine how TEP is formed and what factors most
              influence  formation, 2) determine which taxa are the most significant 
              contributors to TEP formation, 3) establish whether TEP serves as  a food
              source or inhabits feeding of zooplankton, 4) investigate  degradation of TEP
              by bacteria, and 5) examine seasonality of TEP  in nature.
