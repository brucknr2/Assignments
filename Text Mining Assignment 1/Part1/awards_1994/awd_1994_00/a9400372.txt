Abstract    :
              9400372  Beasley  The   Materials  Research  Science  and  Engineering  Center 
              (MRSEC) known as the Center for Materials Research (CMR)  at  Stanford 
              University supports research over a wide  area  of  materials  science,  with 
              a strong  emphasis  on  providing  support   through  shared  facilities  for  
              the   materials  community  at  and  around  Stanford  University,  including 
              industry.   The  research  program  is  organized  in  three  interdisciplinary
              research groups.    Investigators  in  the group concerned with 
              superconducting  materials  seek  a broad understanding of  the  behavior  of 
              transition   metal   oxides,  including   high   temperature  superconductors. 
              Researchers aim to extend the selection of  such  materials  for  possible 
              electronic  application  and  explore   possible   new   device   concepts.   
              The   group  investigating  structure and reactivity  of  oxide  surfaces 
              focuses  on  materials relevant for heterogeneous  catalysis  and  
              environmental   geochemistry.  The   magnetics   group  investigates  materials
               problems  related  to  the  use  of  magnetic  thin  films  in the data 
              storage  industry.   Its  initial goal is to understand the three related
              phenomena of  giant  magnetoresistance, magnetic anisotropy in thin films,  and
              optical Kerr rotation in magnetic thin films.    The   center   supports  the 
              development,   operation   and  maintenance of shared experimental facilities
              for  materials  research. It provides seed funding for exploratory  research 
              and  fosters research participation by undergraduates.  This  MRSEC  is 
              associated with an educational  outreach  program  with   emphasis  on 
              attracting  and  retaining  women   and  underrepresented  minorities in
              materials  science  and  has  initiated a summer science outreach program to
              predominantly  minority  high  school students. The center  administers  an 
              industrial outreach program.  It currently supports about 20  faculty,  5 
              postdoctoral research associates,  4  technical   staff  member,  24 graduate
              students, and 10 undergraduates.  This MRSEC is directed by Professor Malcolm
              R. Beasley.  ***
