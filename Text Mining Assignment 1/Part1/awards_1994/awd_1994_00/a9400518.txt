Abstract    :
              9400518  Latushkin       The Principal Investigator proposes to solve some 
              problems at the intersection of the asymptotic theory of  linear semigroups and
              infinite dimensional dynamical systems  to describe the asymptotic properties
              (dichotomy,  hyberbolicity, Lyapunov exponents) of evolutionary systems  and
              semiflows on Banach spaces. The main technical tool is  to involve for this
              description the semigroups of weighted  translation operators. This technique
              would allow one to  view the classical Lyapunov theorems in a fairly unexpected
               perspective.       This work has its roots in the analysis of stability of 
              processes. These processes are frequently described by  differential equations
              and the stability is determined by an  analysis of the asymptotic or large time
              behavior of the  solutions. The solutions of these equations live naturally  in
              abstract structures called Banach spaces and the study of  stability questions
              can be formulated in terms of a metric  or norm. In this way the techniques of
              operator theory can  be used effectively to study stability of dynamical
              systems.  The theory has applications in dynamo theory and the  dynamics of
              chemical reactors.  ***
