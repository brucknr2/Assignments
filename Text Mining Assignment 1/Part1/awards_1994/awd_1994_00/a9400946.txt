Abstract    :
              9400946  Ding       This award funds the research of Professor Guoli  Ding in
              graph theory. Prof. Ding works on the Graph Minors  Project.  He uses the
              techniques of this project to study  infinite antichains of graphs relative to
              graph containment,  topological minors,  and induced subgraphs.       The
              research is in the general area of combinatorics,  in  particular graph theory.
              Combinatorics attempts to find efficient  methods to study how discrete
              collections can be organized.   Graphs are arrangements of points connected by
              lines.  The  behavior of discrete collections like graphs is extremely 
              important in modeling systems and plays a role in modern  computing,
              communications and operations.  For example, the  design of large networks, as
              in telephone systems, and the design  of algorithms in computer science all use
              graphs in their  development, and make use of combinatorial research.
