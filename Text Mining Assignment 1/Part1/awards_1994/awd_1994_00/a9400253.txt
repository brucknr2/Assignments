Abstract    :
              9400253  Bash  The University-National Laboratory System (UNOLS), an association
               of academic institutions, was established in 1971 as a  coordinating and
              planning mechanism for oceanographic facilities  operated by those
              institutions.  The UNOLS Office is the focal  point for planning, coordination
              and reporting of all UNOLS  activities.  It provides administrative staff
              services, prepares  and disseminates ship schedules, user requirements,
              analyses of  annual ship use, committee reports, new marine regulations and 
              other related information.  Support for special studies, the  Medical Advisory
              Service for ship's crews and scientists, travel  expenses by UNOLS Council
              members, committees and consultants is  also provided through the UNOLS Office.
                 This project will conduct the activities of the UNOLS Office  during the
              first year of a three year commitment to UNOLS Office  operations by five
              Federal agencies.  These agencies include: The  National Science Foundation,
              (Division of Ocean Sciences), The  Department of the Navy (Office of Naval
              Research), The U.S.  Department of Energy, The National Oceanic and Atmospheric
               Administration, and The U.S. Department of the Interior (U.S.  Geological
              Survey and Minerals Management Service).    The UNOLS Office is located at the
              University of Rhode Island.   This project is under the direction of Mr. John
              F. Bash,  Executive Secretary, UNOLS.  ***
