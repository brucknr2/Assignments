Abstract    :
              Banuelos       The investigator will study several problems which lie in the
              intersection of  probability and various areas of analysis. Specifically,
              subject areas include extremal  problems which are motivated from the study of
              Brownian motion in simply connected  planar domains; a geometric
              characterization ofr intrinsic ultracontractivity for certain  types of simply
              connected planar domains; martingale inequalities and a conjecture of  T.
              Iwaniec for the Beurling-Ahlfors operator; and the zero Khintchin inequality
              for  lacunary trigonometric series.       This award will provide funding to
              further study the interrelationship between  mathematical analysis and
              probability theory. Several problems will be investigated  dealing with
              geometry, operators, series and Brownian motion. This should lead to a  better
              understanding of these areas of mathematics, especially as they relate to one 
              another.
