Abstract    :
              9400523  Monbouquette  This project is to develop enzyme-based sensors through
              the  approach of immobilizing the enzyme on an electrode surface.  The 
              objectives of the research are: (1) to engineer a membrane  mimetic surface on
              gold electrodes for optimal electroenzymatic  activity; and (2) to extend this
              technology to commercially  available membrane-bound dehydrogenases of
              industrial importance.   This could lead to the development of sensors for
              creatinine and  fructose.  ***
