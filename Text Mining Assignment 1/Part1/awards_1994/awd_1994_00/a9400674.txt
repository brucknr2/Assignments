Abstract    :
              ***  Hashish  9400674     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II
              project will develop a prototype continuous-pumping abrasive suspension jet
              (ASJ) cutting system for shallow and deep underwater applications. Successful
              completion of the Phase I research effort has shown that high-pressure ASJ is a
              feasible concept for use in underwater cutting of rocks and metals. Phase I
              program results demonstrated the method to be superior to previous abrasive jet
              techniques in submerged environments simulating up to 6,100-m (20,000-ft.)
              ocean depths. Extensive laboratory tests will be performed during Phase II that
              will result in scientific data, prediction models, and a basic understanding of
              the submerged material removal process by high-velocity jets. Phase III
              commercialization activities will include the delivery of a prototype ASJ to
              either the Navy or Oceaneering Technologies for field testing and
              demonstration. The successful development of this technology will enable the
              advantages of ASJ cutting to be readily adapted to platforms, remotely operated
              vehicles, submersibles, and manual operations.   There are a wide range of
              commercial and government applications for ASJ technology including cleaning
              and descaling; mining; exploration; underwater construction; salvage,
              decomissioning and removal; and pipeline repair. Use of ASJ technology in these
              applications will prove more economical and environmentally benign than
              existing underwater cutting technologies.      Keywords:    Abrasive suspension
