Abstract    :
              9400069  Cooper  Research supported by this grant is under the auspices of the
              Arctic Systems Science (ARCSS) Global Change Research Program and is jointly
              sponsored by the Division of Ocean Sciences and the Office of Polar Programs. 
              The research will be centered around a unique and intensive, multidisciplinary
              research expedition to parts of the Arctic Ocean that have never been
              extensively studied.  The 1994 U.S./Canada Arctic Ocean Section is a
              collaborative effort with Canada that will involve approximately 60 scientists
              on a Canadian and a U.S. icebreaker during summer 1994.  NSF-funded projects
              will focus on hydrography, biology, paleo-, and sea-ice studies.  Data
              collected will be amongst the first ever from several regions of the Arctic
              Ocean and will be highly relevant to improving our understanding of how the
              Arctic is an indicator of changing global climate conditions and how it affects
              the physical, chemical, and biological features of the more temperate oceans
              and regions.    This work will identify trends in elemental and isotopic ratios
              of artificial radioactive contaminants particularly iodine-129, technetium, and
              several transuranics.  Sources of these contaminants may be river-borne and
              associated with accidental releases or fuel re-processing activities, or marine
              in origin and associated with breached reactors, weapons, and/or disposed
              wastes.  Although this work will contribute to on-going assessments of
              radionuclide contamination of the Arctic Ocean, the distributions of the
              radioisotopes chosen for study will also improve understanding of Arctic Ocean
              circulation and its hydrologic cycle, particularly the role of the major
              Siberian rivers in influencing physical, biological, and chemical mixing
              processes.  The chemical behavior of the radioisotopes selected for study will
              permit a "fingerprint" identification of the provenance of contaminants due to
              the variability in isotope or elemental ratios in each potential source.  The
              parallel use of other radioisotope, conservati ve tracer (delta^18O and delta
              D), and biologically modified tracer distributions (nutrients, dissolved
              oxygen, and by extension, NO and PO), will contribute to defining particle
              transport and water mixing mechanisms, in addition to describing the
              propagation patterns of contaminants.  ***
