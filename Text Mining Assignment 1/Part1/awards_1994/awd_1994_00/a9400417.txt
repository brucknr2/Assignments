Abstract    :
              9400417  Golding  The   Materials  Research  Science  and  Engineering  Center 
              (MRSEC) at Michigan State University provides a focal  point  for  long-range
              university-based research on  materials  and  devices   that  have  high 
              potential  for  application   in  automotive sensing systems.  The MRSEC
              contains two strongly  focused interdisciplinary research groups.    The  group
               investigating chemically tailored materials  for  automobile  control  and
              diagnostics integrates  efforts  in  chemistry,  physics  and engineering to 
              develop  chemically  tailored  materials  that  can provide  engineers  with 
              new  devices  and  techniques  for the  development  of  improved  automobiles.
                 The   research  targets   specific   sensing  applications related to engine
              performance, which is largely  determined  by the fuel composition entering the
              engine  and  its  turbulent  mixing in the cylinder.  A  newly  developed 
              technique, LIPA (laser induced photochemical anemometry)  is  used to provide
              real-time maps of cylinder gas flows in test  chambers   or   actual  engines. 
               The  group  investigating  materials   used   for  physical  sensing   in  
              automobiles  concentrates  their studies on materials  that  are  rugged, 
              perform well in extremely variable and harsh conditions, and  can be
              manufactured reliably and efficiently.    The  MRSEC supports a variety of
              shared facilities including  a  lithographic facility, space and services in a 
              chemistry  laser laboratory, space in the engine research and turbulent  mixing
                 laboratories,   and   the   engineering   research  laboratories  for  film
              growth and fabrication.    There  is  active   industrial  collaboration  with 
              Ford  and  General  Motors.    Educational  plans for  the  MRSEC  involve 
              K-12  students in urban and rural schools, science and engineering 
              undergraduates  on  campus,  and interdisciplinary  research  participation  by
               advanced degree  candidates.  The  center  currently  supports 13 senior
              investigators, 2  postdocto ral  research  associates, 2 technical staff
              members, 12 graduate  students,   and 4 undergraduates.  The MRSEC is directed 
              by  Professor Brage Golding.  ***
