Abstract    :
                     9400609  Martin  This project supports the dissertation research of a 
              cultural anthropologist from Johns Hopkins University.  The  student will
              observe and interview workers in several  Department of Energy (DOE) sites
              where nuclear weapons are  dismantled and hazardous materials managed.  The
              project  will show how the cultural assumptions of workers affect  their
              conceptions of the value of their work.  Specific  hypotheses to be tested are
              that the conversion from weapons  to peaceful technology (from "making
              weapons", a masculine  activity, to "cleaning up", a feminine job) is seen by 
              workers as a feminization and deskilling of their activity.  Methods include
              formal interviews of active and retired  workers, to assess changes in
              interpretations of the work  over time, as well as interviews with
              administrators and  participant observation in community life.       This
              research is important because the transformation  from war-production to
              civilian goods involves changes in  the cultural context of the work place. 
              Increased  understanding of how workers conceptualize the value of  their work
              can help decision makers design programs of  increased efficiency.  ***
