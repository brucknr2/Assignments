Abstract    :
              9400415  Woodall  The   Materials  Research  Science  and  Engineering  Center 
              (MRSEC)  at  Purdue  University focuses  on  heterostructure  materials  for 
              electronic and photonic  applications.   The  purpose of the Center is to
              develop enabling technologies in  these   areas  of  research  with  the 
              long-term  goal   of  facilitating  the  commercialization of new  products 
              using  these  technologies.   The MRSEC is  organized  through  two 
              interdisciplinary research groups.    The  semiconductor misfit
              heterostructures  group  addresses  problems  associated with the development 
              of  semiconductor  device technology using non-lattice-matched materials.   The
               long  term  goal is to produce economically viable  enabling  technologies for
              fabricating photonic and electronic devices  using  unexplored  semiconductor 
              materials  grown  on  non-  lattice-matched  substrates  with  optical  and  
              electrical  properties matched to specific applications.  The  extrinsic 
              control  of  heterostructure  properties  group  focuses  on  important
              materials problems associated with light  emitting  and   detecting   devices 
              fabricated  from  high-band   gap  semiconductors  with composite semiconductor
              materials  used  for  electronic,  photonic  and optoelectronic  applications 
              (especially nonlinear applications).    The  MRSEC  supports programs for
              educational  outreach  and  human   resource   development  based  on  existing
                Purdue  University efforts.  Special focus is on the enhancement  of 
              programs  for  minority  and  women  students.   The   MRSEC  supports shared
              experimental facilities for the preparation,  fabrication    and  
              characterization   of   heterostructure  materials  and  devices.  The center
              currently  supports  10  senior investigators, 2 postdoctoral research
              associates,  1  technical  staff  member,  8  graduate  students,   and   10 
              undergraduates.   The MRSEC is directed by  Professor  Jerry  Woodall.  ***
