Abstract    :
              9400099  Cole    This three-year award supports U.S.-U.K. cooperative research
              in  materials science between Milton Cole of Pennsylvania State  University and
              Julia Yeomans of Oxford University.  The focus of  their research is physical
              adsorption on surfaces.  Two principal  topics will receive attention: 
              capillary condensation in porous  media; and wetting and prewetting phenomena. 
              The U.S. and U.K.  investigators, who are theoretical physicists, have
              considerable  expertise and overlapping interests.  They will collaborate on 
              calculations and new models.    The field of physical adsorption has received
              much attention in  the last few years because of its technological importance.
              While  this proposal addresses fundamental questions of interest to  surface
              scientists and chemical engineers, its topics underpin  important technologies
              for pollution control, catalysis and  chemical segregation.  ***
