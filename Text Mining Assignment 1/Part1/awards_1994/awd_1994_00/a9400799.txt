Abstract    :
              94-00799  Longfield    The University of Hawaii (UH) requests renewed funding
              for shipboard technician activities associated with the research vessel MOANA
              WAVE, a 213-foot vessel.  The MOANA WAVE is owned by the Navy and operated by
              UH.  In calendar year 1994, the MOANA WAVE will support a total of 109 days of
              NSF-funded research, primarily in the central Pacific.  UH technicians will be
              responsible for operating and repairing instruments while at sea, maintaining
              instruments ashore and assisting with scientific operations necessary before
              and after cruises. Funding for Years 2 and 3 of this award will be negotiated
              when ship schedules for 1995 and 1996 are finalized.
