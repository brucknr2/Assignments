Abstract    :
              9400073  Wiens  This award supports Professors John Wiens and Beatrice Van
              Horne,  together with postdoctoral associate Thomas Crist, all of  Colorado
              State University, to collaborate in ecological research  with Nils Stenseth and
              his group in the Department of Biology of  the University of Oslo, Norway. 
              They are attempting to  understand the relationship of the mosaic structure of
              landscapes  to the ecology of individuals, and to translate these effects to 
              the population and community levels.  The Colorado State group  has strengths
              in simulation modeling while the Oslo group  emphasizes analytical,
              mathematical models.  They will integrate  these approaches to address common
              questions about how  environmental heterogeneity affects ecological systems and
              about  how these effects vary with spatial scale.    Questions about the
              effects of scale and of explicit spatial  heterogeneity on ecological systems
              have become a centerpiece of  contemporary ecology.  This collaboration will
              evaluate two  methodological approaches to these questions by applying them 
              jointly to independently gathered empirical data from the  different systems
              being studied by the two groups.  The result  should be a contribution to
              predictive theory that will have  significant applications in preserving
              biodiversity and  threatened ecosystems.  ***
