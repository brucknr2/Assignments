Abstract    :
              9400471 Keeler          Rare extreme events are part of every ecosystem, but
              since they are by definition unpredictable, testing what traits might be
              adaptive for surviving them is difficult.  Theoretically, extreme conditions
              exert brief, strong natural selection for traits that were not previously
              adaptive.  However, surviving species have weathered such events successfully
              and repeatedly.  The 1993 flood in the US Midwest provides such a truly unique
              opportunity to investigate the following: (1)         whether genome level
              genetic structure is adaptive: specifically, whether polyploidy (or multiple
              genomic copies within a single individual) is, among other things, an
              adaptation for maintaining the genes to survive rare events (2)         weather
              the strong selection of a rare event makes permanent (or very long term)
              changes in the genetic structure of populations.          Big bluestem
              (Andropogon gerardii Vitman) was the dominant grass of the tall grass prairie
              region, (Ohio to Nebraska, Minnesota to Texas).  While dominating the
              landscape, its distribution ends above recurrently flooded areas, suggesting
              only limited tolerance to flooding.  Weaver and Albertson (e.g. 1936, 1943,
              1944) documented the response of    A   .   gerardii    and other prairie
              grasses to the Great Drought of the 1930's.  The 1993 flood allows us to
              compare the impact of excessive water.          This project will capitalize on
              a unique event to the test the dif ficult problem of whether there is selection
              for higher polypoids in natural population and whether extreme events produce
              natural selection with permanent impact on the populations.  Known populations
              of dominant grass are available and the more detailed analysis of those
              populations to be established here will allow future monitoring to detect
              changes in other years.  If this is indeed a unique event, Dr Keeler will learn
              about the importance of such events and be able to watch results in return of
              the ongoing selection pressures of ordinary years.  If future years are wet,
              multiple established populations will allow observation of directional
              selection on natural populations on an ecosystem dominant, an important
              component of understanding organismal response to climate change.
