Abstract    :
              9400777  Storm    The Gordon Research Conference are help every summer to
              discuss  recent findings and current thinking in various areas of science. 
              Although participation is limited, the attendees usually consist  of
              established scientists, young investigators who are making  important
              contributions in these areas, and post doctoral  fellows. They are usually held
              in small isolated New England  towns away from other distractions and are
              conducive to the free  exchange of ideas.  These conferences have a recognized
              value for  presenting the latest advances in research and also indicating  the
              future trends which are likely to be most productive.  ***
