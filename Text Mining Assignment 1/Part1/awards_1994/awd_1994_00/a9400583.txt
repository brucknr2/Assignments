Abstract    :
              9400583  Pickering    Technical Narrative:    This proposal represents a
              collaborative research effort  between the Pennsylvania State University (Dr.
              H. W.  Pickering) and Cairo University (Drs. B. Ateya and B. El-  Anadouli). 
              The investigators intend to study the problems  of de-alloying in corrosive
              environments.  The proposed work  involves physical and mathematical modeling
              and experimental  measurements on de-alloying.  Their objective is to 
              understand the mechanism and details of the various rate  processes involved in
              de-alloying.  Project funding will  enable the researchers to work together for
              one month each  year over the course of this three-year study.    This project
              in materials science fulfills the program  objective of advancing scientific
              knowledge by enabling  leading experts in the United States and Egypt to
              combine  complementary talents and conduct research in areas of  strong mutual
              interest and competence.  The project aims to  provide a much needed insight
              into the scientific aspects of  this universal corrosion problem which is of
              common concern  to both groups.  ***
