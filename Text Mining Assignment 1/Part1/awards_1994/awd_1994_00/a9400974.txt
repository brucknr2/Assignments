Abstract    :
              9400974  Jiang      The research entails connectedness properties of Julia sets 
              in complex dynamical systems. A local connectedness property  already
              established for certain cases is proposed to be  established in a more general
              context. This research is in the  mainstream of ideas of modern dynamical
              systems. Work of this  type has applications to fractals and chaos. Since this
              area has  become increasingly visual and more accessible to other  scientific
              fields, there is potential educational value.  ***
