Abstract    :
              9400146  Choobineh       This research will develop a standard methodology for
              creating  effective Flexible Manufacturing System (FMS) controllers, using a 
              combination of Fuzzy Logic (FL)  and Neural Network (NN)  technologies.  This
              combination is known as  a Neuro-Fuzzy Logic  Controller (NFLC), and holds
              promise in the  control of automated  manufacturing systems.  To facilitate the
               development of an NFLC,  Generalized Stochastic Petri Nets (GSPNs)  will be
              used.  Specifically the GSPN of an FMS will be partitioned  into two  subnets -
              one for the physical plant, and one for the  controller.       The productivity
              of an FMS is highly dependent upon the  effectiveness and efficiency of the
              controller  algorithms  employed.  Current FMS controllers fall substantially 
              short on  these measures.
