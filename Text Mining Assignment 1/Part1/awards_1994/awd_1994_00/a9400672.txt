Abstract    :
              9400672  Hosmane  Southern Methodist Univ.  Dr. Narayan Hosmane, Chemistry
              Department, Southern Methodist University, is supported by the Inorganic,
              Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program for an investigation into
              the preparation and chemistry of complexes of small carborane ligands.
              Coordinately unsaturated lanthanacarboranes will be prepared and utilized as
              precursors to 14-electron metal alkyl derivatives. The reactivity patterns of
              "carbon separated" six-atom carboranes will be established with main group,
              early transition, and lanthanide metals and comparisons will be drawn with
              related "carbon apart" derivatives. Neutral, zwitterionic, and/or ionic,
              14-electron carborane and mixed ligand complexes will be prepared and evaluated
              as Ziegler-Natta olefin polymerization catalysts.   In order to utilize metal
              ions in many important applications, it is often necessary to contain them in
              molecular assemblages which permit them to interact with other species in a
              controlled fashion. A common way of achieving this goal is to utilize groups
              (ligands) which may be attached to a metal in order to create a specific
              desired environment about the metal. In this project compounds a relatively
              unstudied class of "ligands", the six atom carboranes, will be studied to learn
              their ability to stabilize electron poor metals so that they may form valuable
              catalysts.
