Abstract    :
              The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center  (MRSEC) at the University
              of California - San Diego  undertakes research related to the performance of
              magnetic  recording materials.  The research program is organized  through a
              single interdisciplinary research group.    The research group is focused on
              the experimental and  theoretical analysis of hysteresis, dynamics, and spin 
              transport in magnetic particles and thin films.   The goal  of the group is to
              provide a quantitative microscopic  description of the phenomena underlying the
              observed  macroscopic hysteresis properties of these magnetic systems.    The
              MRSEC is closely associated with the Center for Magnetic  Recording Materials
              (CMRM), which is fully funded by  industry.   In addition the MRSEC will
              support a broad range  of interactions and collaboration with industry and an 
              expanded range of educational outreach programs.  The MRSEC  currently supports
              11 senior investigators, 4 postdoctoral  research associates, 2 technical staff
              members, 11 graduate  students, and 5 undergraduates.  The MRSEC is co-directed
              by  Professors Ami E. Berkowitz and Sheldon Schultz.
