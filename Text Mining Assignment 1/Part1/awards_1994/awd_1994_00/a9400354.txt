Abstract    :
              The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center  (MRSEC) known as the
              Center on Polymer Interfaces and  Macromolecular Assemblies (CPIMA) at Stanford
              University is  a partnership among research groups at Stanford University, 
              IBM-Almaden, and the University of California Davis.  The  center supports
              interactive research through three  interdisciplinary research groups.    The
              group investigating macromolecular design for enhanced  film properties aims to
              design and synthesize novel polymers  which have unique optical and electronic
              properties, and  then characterize their equilibrium and dynamical behavior 
              when they are constrained by interfaces.  Researchers in the  group focused on
              ultrathin films aim to design and  synthesize substrate-bound ultrathin organic
              films that  mediate the chemical and physical interactions between the 
              substrate and an adjacent overlayer.  Investigators in the  group investigating
              the dynamics of interfacial processing  seek to understand the interfacial
              transport processes that  occur during the fabrication of ultrathin films of
              polymers  and polymer-based nanoncomposite materials.    The center  also
              supports the development, operation and  maintenance of shared experimental
              facilities for materials  research.   It provides seed funding for exploratory 
              research, and  fosters research participation by  undergraduates.  The center
              has educational programs from  high school to the graduate level and carries
              out  collaborative research with industry.   The center currently  supports
              about 16 senior investigators, 12 postdoctoral  research associates, 2
              technical staff members, 18 graduate  students, and 6 undergraduates.  This
              MRSEC is directed by  Professor Curtis W. Frank.
