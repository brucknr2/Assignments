Abstract    :
              9400329  Jaron  The research proposed in this application is concerned with 
              modeling the steady state and time-varying properties of O2-  CO2 coupled
              transport in the microcirculation.  The model  developed is a compartmental
              model representation from the  distributed model.  Simulations are carried out 
              systematically by applying space-averaging methods to the  corresponding
              distributed models.  These simulation results  will be compared with
              experimental results appearing in the  literature.  The long term goal of this
              research program is  to incorporate the results of this study with previously 
              developed mechanical and hemodynamic models of circulation  in order to relate
              the metabolic and mechanical performance  of the system and study their
              interaction.  It is expected  that the integration of gas transport and
              metabolism with  the hemodynamic behavior of the system will be an important 
              step toward improving understanding of the control  characteristics of the
              biological system.  This research may  be important in understanding the normal
              physiological  system, as well as for pathological phenomena involving 
              hypoxia, heteroxia, and gas toxicity.  ***
