Abstract    :
              The   Materials  Research  Science  and  Engineering  Center  (MRSEC)   at   the
                University  of   Alabama   features   a  multidisciplinary  research  program
               built   on   a   solid  foundation provided by the existing Center for
              Materials for  Information   Technology   (MINT).    The   MRSEC   supports 
              interactive research through two interdisciplinary  research  groups.    The  
              group   which   focuses   on   the   relationship   of  microstructure   and  
              magnetic   properties   carries   out  fundamental  measurements on materials 
              systems  which  have  potential applications in future magnetic recording
              systems.  Of  particular interest are nitrogenated iron based  alloys,  high   
              magnetization   iron   nitride   films   and   giant  magnetoresistance thin
              films.   The group which concentrates  on  the preparation and dispersion of
              magnetic nanoparticles  is  directed  to  develop  new synthetic  methods  for 
               the  preparation  of magnetic particles and to gain a fundamental 
              understanding of magnetic dispersions.    The  MRSEC is housed in the same
              research building where the  MINT  Center  is  located and shares  a  number 
              of  central  facilities  with  the existing center.   Collaboration  with 
              industry  is  extensive  and well established  by  the  MINT  Center.   The 
              MRSEC provides seed funding  for  exploratory  research    and   emphasizes  
              minority   recruitment    and  interdisciplinary  training.   A  major 
              component  of   the  educational  goals  is  to attract, retain  and  train 
              more  students  in  a  technologically important  area  where,  as 
              demonstrated by the success of graduates, excellent jobs are  available.  The
              close association with the Historically Back  Colleges and Universities (HBCU)
              in the South is utilized to  enhance  current  outreach programs  that  support
               minority  students  and  faculty.   The center  currently  supports  7 
              faculty,   5   post-doctoral  assistants,  and  5   graduate  students.  The
              MRSEC is directed by Professor William D oyle.
