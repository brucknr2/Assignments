Abstract    :
              9400740  Bussell  This research project, from a primarily undrgraduate 
              institution, is concerned with studies of hydrodesulfurization  catalysis.  It
              combines the use of ultra high vacuum electron  spectroscopic methods with flow
              reactor studies of high surface  area molybdenum based catalysts.  Molybdenum
              carbide based  materials are the focus of the research, which has been 
              carefully designed to enable the participation of talented  undergraduates in
              the work.  This project is supported jointly  by the Analytical and Surface
              Chemistry Program of the  Chemistry Division, and the Chemical Reaction
              Processes Program  of the Division of Chemical and Transport Systems.  The
              results  of this work will impact strongly on the rational design of 
              hydrodesulfurization catalysts.  %%%  A combination of ultra high vacuum and
              flow reactor methods  will be used in this project to probe the catalytic
              chemistry  of molybdenum carbide based catalytic materials.  This work  will
              provide the basic understanding needed for the rational  design and utilization
              of these complex catalytic systems.  ***
