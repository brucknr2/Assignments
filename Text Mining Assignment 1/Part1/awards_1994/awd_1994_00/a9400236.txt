Abstract    :
              9400236  Staley    This three-year award supports U.S.-Sweden cooperative
              research in  organic chemistry and dynamics between Stuart W. Staley of 
              Carnegie-Mellon University and Bertil Eliasson of the University of  Umea in
              Sweden.  The objective of their research is to measure the  electronic
              conductivities of various organic structural units,  which can be thought of as
              building blocks for "organic wires".    The U.S. investigator brings to this
              collaboration expertise in the  synthesis and preparation of bridged
              dicyclooctatetraenes  compounds.  This is complemented by Swedish expertise in
              NMR  spectroscopy.  In the proposed project, the U.S. group will prepare  the
              compounds using advanced NMR techniques such as triple  resonance. Then
              Carnegie-Mellon graduate students will perform  joint experiments with the
              Swedish group using a state-of-the-art  high-field NMR spectrometer located at
              the University of Umea.    The results of this study will be relevant to a
              number of active  research areas, including electron transfer, conducting
              polymers,  and molecular electronics.  ***
