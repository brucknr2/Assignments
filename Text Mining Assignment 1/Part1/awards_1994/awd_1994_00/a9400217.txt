Abstract    :
                   The investigator develops more effective and efficient Newton  iterative
              (truncated Newton) methods, i.e., implementations of  Newton's method that use
              iterative linear algebra methods.  A  concomitant objective is to develop
              improved Krylov subspace  methods and associated techniques for linear
              problems; this work  supports the primary objective and is important in its own
              right.  The project centers around recently developed globally convergent 
              inexact Newton algorithms, improved implementations of GMRES, and  new
              applications of Lanczos-based methods and "residual smoothing"  techniques.  A
              specific goal is to construct high-quality codes for  Newton iterative methods
              and for GMRES that are suitable for  public distribution.       Newton
              iterative methods and Krylov subspace methods have  many important scientific
              and industrial applications; examples  include aircraft dynamics modeling,
              semiconductor modeling,  climate modeling, oil reservoir simulation, and
              contaminant  transport in aquifers.  The large-scale problems to which they are
               usually applied often require high-performance vector and parallel  computers
              and, indeed, have provided significant incentive for  their development.  This
              research contributes to improved  computational modeling techniques for
              scientific and industrial  applications and more effective utilization of
              high-performance  computers.
