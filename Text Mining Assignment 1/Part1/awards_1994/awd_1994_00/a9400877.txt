Abstract    :
              9400877  Killeen         The objective of this research is to continue and
              extend a  series of theoretical studies of the Earth's upper atmosphere, 
              involving applying various post processor computer programs to  study the
              physically significant processes that cause change in the  various fields
              calculated by the model.  The focus of this work  will be on two areas:  (1)
              existing post processors will be  maintained and modified to match the
              continuing development of the  Thermosphere/Ionosphere Electrodynamic General
              Circulation Model to  provide improved diagnostics of thermospheric processes
              and aid in  CEDAR experimental investigations; and (2) a series of scientific 
              studies are proposed:  a thermodynamic term analysis of wave modes,  a study of
              momentum dissipation's role on particle transport,  causes of the distribution
              of minor species, ion-neutral and  neutral-ion coupling, and so forth. 
              Finally, this project will be  collaborative with the National Center for
              Atmospheric Research.  ***
