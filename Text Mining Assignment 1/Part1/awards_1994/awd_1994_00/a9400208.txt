Abstract    :
              Beasley/Abstract       The objective of this research is an optical examination
              of  green thunderstorms using a spectral photometer to evalutate two  competing
              theories about the transmission, absorption and  scattering of (visible) light
              in and near thunderstorms. The  observations will be made in Oklahoma during a
              meteorological field  experiment (VORTEX) designed to investigate tornados.
