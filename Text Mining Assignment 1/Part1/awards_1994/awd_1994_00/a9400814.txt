Abstract    :
                This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              will assist the  Department of Chemistry at the University of Southern
              California to construct injection seeded  optical parametric oscillators (OPOs)
              as sources of high-brightness, high-resolution tunable  radiation.  The
              timetable for this instrument construction project is as follows:    Year 1:   
                            Purchase Nd:YAG laser.                           Purchase diode
              lasers and crystals.                            Purchase and install diagnostic
              electronics.                           Construct prototype assembly:  3-4
              diodes, no doubling or mixing.                           Demonstrate SLM
              operation.                           Construct optoacoustic cell for absorption
              measurement.    Year 2:                  Build second assembly similar to the
              one constructed in Year 1.                           Extend tuning range by
              frequency doubling and mixing.                           Extend tuning range by
              installing additional diodes.                           Integrate the above
              assembly into an experiment in the PIs' labs.    Year 3:                 
              Optimize devices incorporating several diode lasers and doubling and           
                             mixing frequency extension techniques.                          
              Build injection seeded assemblies designed for specific projects in the PIs'   
                                     laboratories.                           Integrate newly
              developed diode lasers into existing assemblies.    A tunable infrared laser
              can provide important information about chemical reactivity.  Its use  may
              enable breakthroughs in our understanding of the properties of reactive and
              nonreactive of  molecules.
