Abstract    :
              9400665  Duncan   SMASCH is a collaborative effort by the Association of
              California Herbaria (ACH) to develop and implement a distributed database that
              will store and manage information obtained from accessions of vascular plants
              collected in California.  The database will enhance understanding of the
              state's vascular plant resources, both living and preserved, and will improve
              the efficiency of many herbarium operations, this renewal will allow UC/JEPS
              to:  complete data entry for the UC/JEPS portion of the SMASCH database;
              maintain and modify data entry software, develop an image archive, and develop
              user access tools; extend the data model to collection management activities
              including exchange and production of labels and forms; further develop
              connections to literature-based checklists of taxa, multiple-entry keys, and
              other aspects of floristic information management.
