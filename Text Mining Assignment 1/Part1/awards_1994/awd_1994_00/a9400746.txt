Abstract    :
              9400746  Crannell       This program provides opportunities for undergraduate
              students  to be active participants in solar physics research in the 
              Laboratory for Astronomy and Solar Physics (LASP) at Goddard Space  Flight
              Center.  The LASP group is at the forefront of current  research in the
              development and implementation of Fourier-Transform  imaging for the hard X-ray
              and gamma-ray emission sources in solar  flares.  The projects available for
              student participation in the  Solar Physics Branch in LASP include an
              instrument to be flown on  a small satellite, a shuttle payload, a rocket
              flight, and a  balloon flight.  The potential computer modeling and data
              analysis  projects are supported by a growing number of data sets available 
              through the Solar Data Analysis Center and the participation of  Goddard
              scientists as mentors for students.  ***
