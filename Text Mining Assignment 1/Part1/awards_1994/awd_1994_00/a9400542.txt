Abstract    :
              In this in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry  
              Division, Chronister will test theoretical models of the dynamics of  
              molecular solids.  A combination of high pressure and ultrafast nonlinear  
              coherent spectroscopic techniques will be used as high resolution probes   of
              the dynamics of molecular solids at low temperatures.  Ultrafast   coherent
              Raman, photon echo, and material preparation techniques will be   used to
              uncover the homogeneous dynamics in amorphous and pressure   broadened systems.
               These experiments will be used to refine theories of   optical and vibrational
              dephasing in amorphous and mixed crystalline   solids.  %%%  Chronister will
              measure the behavior of solids under high pressure and   low temperatures.  The
              information gathered is difficult to obtain   because the pressures involved
              are extremely high and temperatures are   very low.  However, these data will
              ultimately aid our understanding of   the dynamic interactions between species
              in solid solution and their host   materials.
