Abstract    :
                   Biomass burning worldwide is a significant source of a number  of important
              atmospheric trace gases (e.g., C0, C02, CH4, NH3) and  aerosols.  It therefore
              plays an important role in atmospheric  chemistry and, possibly, in the
              radiative balance of the earth.   The purpose of this research is to improve
              quantitative estimates  for the emissions of a number of trace gases and
              aerosols from  biomass burning in tropical forests, which is probably the
              largest  source of emissions from biomass burning worldwide.       Airborne
              measuring techniques which have been applied  successfully by this research
              group to studies of biomass burning  in North America and the 1991 Kuwait oil
              fires, will be used to  measure the masses of various gases and aerosols
              emitted into the  atmosphere per unit mass of fuel burned from various types of
              fires  in Brazil.  These measurements will be used to improve estimates of 
              global emissions of the measured species from biomass burning in  the tropics. 
              The chemical composition, cloud condensation nucleus  activity, and time
              evolution of the aerosols from the fires will  also be measured.       These
              studies will form part of a larger investigations of  both the physical and
              chemical properties and effects on the  atmosphere of biomass burning in
              Brazil.  The funds provided by NSF  will support the chemical component of the
              overall study.
