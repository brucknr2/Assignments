Abstract    :
              Grosholz  9400706    The recent introduction of the green crab, Carcinus maenas,
               will likely have profound, community wide effects on the  fauna of coastal
              embayments along the Pacific coast of the  North America.  The green crab is a
              voracious predator that  strongly depresses the abundance of invertebrate prey
              in its  native range as well as areas where it has been previously  introduced.
               By reducing the abundance of benthic  invertebrates, the predatory activities
              of the green crab  can have cascading effects by reducing the abundance of 
              wintering shorebirds, fishes and other predators that feed  on benthic
              invertebrates in these habitats.  Although  invasions are common in marine and
              estuarine systems, the  direct and indirect effects are rarely documented. 
              Serendipitously, the green crab was discovered eight months  ago in Bodega
              Harbor on the reserve of the Bodega Marine Lab  of the University of
              California, Davis, where extensive data  have been collected for the past ten
              years on the abundance  of both invertebrate and shore birds species.  This
              project  will document the impact of this introduced predator on  populations
              of benthic invertebrates and the resulting  effects on the abundance of
              wintering shorebirds.    ***
