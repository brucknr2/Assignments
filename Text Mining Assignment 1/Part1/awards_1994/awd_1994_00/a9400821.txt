Abstract    :
              9400821  Pietsch   The islands of the Kuril Archipelago form the eastern
              boundary of the Okhotsk Sea and a bridge between Hokkaido, the northernmost
              island of Japan, and the Russian peninsula of Kamchatka.  They are a natural
              laboratory for investigations into the origin of insular populations.  Although
              considerable information is available for wide-ranging, commercially important
              species, such as salmon and marine mammals, the flora and fauna of the Kurils
              as a whole are poorly known.  At the same time, the current political situation
              poses a serious environmental threat to the islands.  A team of no more than
              twelve Russian, Japanese, and American scientists will conduct a survey and
              inventory of the freshwater and terrestrial mollusks of Kunashir and Iturup,
              two of the most biologically diverse islands of the Kuril Archipelago.  Working
              cooperatively with universities and the national and local governments of the
              host country, the project will provide training for faculty, students and
              government biologists.  The results of this preliminary expedition will
              demonstrate whether a full-scale biotic survey, of the kind described in the
              initial proposal, is feasible.  At the same time, the work will represent a
              significant start toward building a foundation of information to promote
              long-term future research and conservation.
