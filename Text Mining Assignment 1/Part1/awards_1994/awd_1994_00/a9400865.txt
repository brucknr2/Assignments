Abstract    :
              9400865  Sorensen          This  is  an award under the Grants for Improving 
              Doctoral  Dissertation  Research program.  It is a study  of  the  conflict 
              between  school  values and street values  experienced  by  young  black 
              inner-city  males.  A combination of intensive  interviews  and participant
              observation will be carried out among young black  males  in Cambridge, MA,
              with the student researcher assisted  by  research  assistants  drawn  from
              high  school  students  in  the  community being studied.  These qualitative
              methods will be  used  to  assess  the nature and extent of the conflict
              between  values  necessary for survival in inner-city streets and values needed
              to  succeed in school.        Much previous research on the academic
              achievement problems  of inner city and minority youths has utilized
              quantitative data.  Such  data do not help us understand the values that get
              attached  to schooling in the minds of such youths and how those values are 
              formed.    By   focusing  directly  on  the  conflicting   values  experienced
              by young black males in one large city, this  project  will  help  us 
              understand  the  cultural  barriers  to  academic  achievement  by  such youths
              and may help yield clues  about  how  such  barriers  can be overcome.  In
              addition to  the  scientific  gains  to be achieved by the research, this award
              will materially  assist a highly promising student in completing research for 
              the  Ph.   D.   dissertation.   Thus  it  contributes  to  the  future 
              scientific  manpower of the nation and the thorough  training  of  the next
              generation of social scientists.  ***
