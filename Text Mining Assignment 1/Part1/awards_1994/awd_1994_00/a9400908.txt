Abstract    :
              9400908   Frenkel               This award supports research in algebra and
              quantum field  theory.  The principle investigator will study the connections 
              among vertex operator algebras, quantum groups and modular tensor  categories. 
              He will also work on the categorification of these  algebraic structures, as
              well as, problems related to their  q-deformations.              Conformal
              field theory is an important physical theory  describing both two-dimensional
              critical phenomena in condensed  matter physics and classical motions of
              strings in string theory.   Besides its importance in physics, the beautiful
              and rich  mathematical structure of conformal field theory also has  interested
              many mathematicians.  New relations between different  branches of mathematics,
              such as representations of  infinite-dimensional Lie algebras and groups,
              Riemann surfaces  and algebraic curves, the Monster sporadic group, modular 
              functions and modular forms, elliptic genera, and knot theory, is  revealed in
              the study of conformal field theory.
