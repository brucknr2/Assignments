Abstract    :
              Site grant support is requested for a Research Experience for  Undergraduates
              (REU) program for the next three years at the  Geophyical Institute.  This
              program will give research  opportunities to undergraduates majoring in physics
              and closely  related disciplines.  The program objective is to acquaint 
              undergraduates with life and wwork at a research institute.  This  is done by
              providing summer educational work in which  undergraduates become interns
              participating in the research  activities of the Geophysical Institute. 
              Research topics available  in this program concentrate on space physics,
              aeronomy and global  change (atmospheric science), but also include, ice and
              solid Earth  topics within the Geophysical Institute, and solid state physics 
              and laser physics at the Physics Department.  The aim is to  encourage \the
              undergraduates to continue their education in  graduate school and become
              research scientists.  In this program,  the interns are assigned to conduct
              research with principal  investigators who direct their work and serve as
              mentors through  their internship.  There is a common program of weekly
              lectures and  field trips designed to expose interns to fields of research
              beyond  the scope of their own projects.  Through their close relationship 
              with their mentors, contacts with graduate students, attending  seminars,
              lectures and thesis defenses, and participating in field  trips, the interns
              gain a first hand perspective on life and work  as a research scientist.
