Abstract    :
              Wirth  9400707    This award renews funding for Scripps Institute of
              Oceanography (SIO) to provide shipboard technician activities associated with
              the research vessels MELVILLE, a 279-foot vessel, NEW HORIZON, a 170 foot
              vessel, and SPROUL, a 125 foot vessel.  The MELVILLE is owned by the Navy,
              while the other two vessels are owned by the University of California San
              Diego.  All three are operated by SIO in support of oceanographic research. In
              calendar year 1994, the three ships will support a total of 595 days of
              NSF-funded research.  SIO technicians will be responsible for operating and
              repairing instruments while at sea, maintaining instruments ashore and
              assisting with scientific operations as necessary before and after cruises.
