Abstract    :
              This project to develop and apply quantum chemical methods is supported   by the
              NSF Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program.  Improved   methods,
              including a 4th-order method, will be developed for locating   stationary
              points and for following reaction paths on ab initio potential   energy
              surfaces using redundant internal coordinates, distance   coordinates, and 
              curvilinear displacements.   Symmetry-breaking (both   spatial symmetry and
              spin symmetry) are treated.  Applications include:   radical abstraction
              reactions using Marcus theory, rearrangement   reactions involving cyclic
              transition states, and a study of   intermediates in titanium nitride vapor
              deposition.    The problem of locating stationary points, either local minima
              or   transition states, is commonly encountered in theoretical investigations  
              of the molecular structure and chemical reactivity of new materials.  A   major
              goal of this research project is to develop mathematical methods to   improve
              the efficiency of such computations on modern computers.  These   methods will
              be applied to a number of chemical problems, and will also   be made available
              to other scientists.  In particular, they will be   implemented in the widely
              used GAUSSIAN codes for molecular electronic   structure computation.
