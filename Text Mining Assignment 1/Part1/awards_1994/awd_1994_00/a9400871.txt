Abstract    :
              Fogel And States  DEB-9400871  Hypogeous fungi (truffles and false truffles)
              will be surveyed on forest islands in the Great Basin and Arizona.  These are
              among the least known species, and the western U.S. is potentially a region of
              high diversity.  Additionally, the Hypogeous fungi are keystone species,
              critical to the survival of the important coniferous forests.  These fungi also
              provide an ideal system for studying mutualistic relationships.  They from
              obligate, ectomycorrhizal associations with forest trees and are dependent on
              rodents fro spore dispersal.  Hypogeous fungi can exist only in the scattered
              forest islands in the region east of the Sierra Nevada-Cascade ranges; thus,
              this provides an opportunity to explore speciation and biogeography among
              fungi.  The data will be useful in identifying truffles and false truffles for
              establishing ectomycorrhizae on tree seedling destined for out planting on
              calcareous soils, as dietary sources for small mammals, and for understanding
              factors for maintaining large rodent populations for endangered predators.
