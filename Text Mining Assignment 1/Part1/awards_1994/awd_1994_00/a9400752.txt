Abstract    :
              9400752  Douglas      The  U.S.-Japan  Workshop  on Bridge  Engineering  is  an 
              annual  meeting between American and Japanese bridge engineers, which  is 
              conducted under the auspices of the U.S.-Japan Panel of Wind  and  Seismic 
              Effects of the UJNR program.  this 1994 meeting includes  a   two-day  
              workshop  with  technical  presentations   of   the  participants related to
              recent advances of bridge engineering and  a  study  tour  of  bridge 
              structures  and  orginizations.   The  workshop will be held at Lake Tahoe,
              Nevada in May 1994, and will  be  preceded  by a one-day meeting between
              American and  Japanese  researchers   to  investigate  the  possibilities   for
                further  cooperative U.S.-Japan research on bridge engineering issues.  ***
