Abstract    :
              9400895  Swidler          This  is  an award under the Grants for Improving 
              Doctoral  Dissertation  Research program.  It is a study of  organizational 
              change   and  differentiation.   Detailed  information  will   be  collected on
              every known organization that has arisen in the  gay  and  lesbian  community
              of San Francisco between 1950  and  1993,  with  the  total  number  of
              organizations  studied  expected  to  approach  2000.   The changing ways in
              which these  organizations  have  expressed their identities over this period
              will be studied  qualitatively.  In addition, quantitative tests will  be 
              carried  out on predictions drawn from competing theories of organization, 
              particularly   ones   concerning  trends  toward   organizational 
              homogenization versus diversification over time.        This  project  will
              contribute to several different  fields  within  sociology.  Through its focus
              on organizational  identity  formation,  this research will enlighten
              prevailing  work  within  cultural  sociology  and  the study of social 
              movements,  fields  which  deal  with  the processes by which low status  or 
              deviant  groups struggle to gain acceptance and power.  It will also speak  to 
              important  issues  in  organizational  sociology,  since  the  increasing 
              diversity  of  organizations  over  time  appears  to  contradict    prevailing
                expectations   that   trends    toward  organizational  homogenization should
              dominate.  In  addition  to  the  scientific gains to be achieved by the
              research, this  award  will  materially assist a highly promising student in 
              completing  research for the Ph. D. dissertation.  Thus it contributes to the 
              future  scientific  manpower  of  the  nation  and  the  thorough  training of
              the next generation of social scientists.  ***
