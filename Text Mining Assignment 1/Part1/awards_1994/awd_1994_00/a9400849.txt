Abstract    :
              9400849  Chen  Industrial plasmas are becoming increasingly important in the
              manufacturing of products ranging from turbine blades to potato chip bags. 
              Particularly important to the U.S. economy are semiconductor chips and
              flat-panel displays.  Present equipment is centered around the RIE (Reactive
              Ion Etching)tool, which is used  almost universally. In recent years, equipment
              manufacturers have been evaluating new plasma sources with the potential to
              create larger, more uniform, and denser plasmas, which could improve the
              efficiency of plasma processing in future generations of manufacturing
              equipment.  One of these new sources is the helicon source, which the author
              has helped develop under NSF sponsorship. The helicon source is now among the
              top three alternatives to the RIE discharge that are being considered in
              industry.  However, the potential of the helicon source is far from being
              realized.  The present proposal lists ten projects (not all of which can be
              supported by the NSF) which are intended to optimize this device for various
              applications, to compare it with competing devices, and to better understand
              the operation of industrial plasmas in general.  Though these studies are meant
              to give results of practical utility to industry and the technological
              superiority of the U.S., they are fundamental and scientific in nature, and are
              therefore not easily supportable by industrial consortia or the Department of
              Defense.  The objectives are long-term (years instead of months), and we hope
              that they lie within the mission of the NSF.   ***
