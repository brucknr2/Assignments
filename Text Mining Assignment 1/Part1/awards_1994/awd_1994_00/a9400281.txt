Abstract    :
              McDuff  94-00281    The University of Washington requests renewed funding for
              shipboard technician activities associated with the research vessel THOMAS
              THOMPSON-a 274-foot vessel and the R/V BARNES - a 66 foot vessel.  The
              T.THOMPSON was constructed by the Navy in 1991.  It is owned by the Navy and
              operated by the University.  In calendar year 1994, the T.THOMPSON will support
              a total of 153 days of NSF-funded research in the northwestern Pacific and
              Arabian Sea.  The BARNES will support a total of 47 days of NSF-funded research
              in the northwestern U.S. coastal waters.  UW technicians will be responsible
              for operating and repairing instruments while at sea, maintaining instruments
              onshore and assisting with scientific operations necessary before and after
              cruises.  Budgets for years 2 and 3 of this grant will be negotiated when ship
              schedules for those years are finalized.
