Abstract    :
              9400213  Ogale       The goal of this research is the development of
              methodologies  for the integration of materials design with free form 
              manufacturing.  Design will be based on the assumption that the  product can be
              built by decomposing it into layers, and then  creating each layer by a free
              form manufacturing technique.   Knowledge of the designed material and stress
              and strain contours  in the product will be used to plan the prototyping
              process.  Surface contour and form error desired, as well as structural 
              analysis results will determine the layer thickness, layout of  fibers in each
              layer, beam diameter, traverse speed and  polymerization.  The design
              methodologies will be validated by  processing parts in an automated
              photolithography unit.  A  continuous fiber dispensing device will provide
              automatic fiber  placement and laser beam motion in the required patterns.  In
              situ  addition of fibers will provide an opportunity for the  investigation of
              two fundamental issues, wetting of the fiber  surfaces by photoresins and the
              hindered cure kinetics of  photoresins due to the presence of reinforcing
              fibers.         This research will provide information about the movement of 
              liquid fronts along fiber surfaces and give insight into the "slip"  phenomenon
              at the gas-liquid-solid interface, and it will help in  developing an
              understanding of the cure mechanisms in  multifunctional photoresins that are
              used in free form  manufacturing techniques.
