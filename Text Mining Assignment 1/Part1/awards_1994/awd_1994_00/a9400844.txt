Abstract    :
                  Martin      This project seeks to make the subject of ionizing radiation
              accessible and understandable to students at levels from middle school to
              medical school through semi-quantitative laboratory experiences.  The vehicle
              for doing this is a suspension of micro-droplets of a liquid, which are super
              heated at room temperature, in a gel.  The energy carried by the ionizing
              radiation triggers bubble formation.  The cavitation which initiates the bubble
              produces a "pop" which can be amplified enabling easy counting of the event. 
              In Phase II experimental kits for each include vials of the suspension,
              electronic circuits and appropriate instructional materials.
