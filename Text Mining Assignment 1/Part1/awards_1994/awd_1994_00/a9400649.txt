Abstract    :
              9400649  Haynie      This award is under the International Junior Investigator 
              and Postdoctoral Fellows Program, which enables U.S.  scientists and engineers
              to conduct three to twelve months  of research abroad at research centers of
              proven excellence.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint 
              research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities,  expertise and
              experimental conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month
              postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Donald T. Haynie of Johns Hopkins
              University to  work with Dr. Christopher M. Dobson at the University of 
              Oxford.    Their research concerns the origin of the structural  stability of
              the molten globule state in protein folding.  Understanding how proteins fold
              is a major objective of  biophysical and medical research throughout the world
              today.  Many commercial opportunities depend on knowing how  information is
              transferred from an extended polypeptide  chain to the corresponding
              equilibrium three-dimensional  structure.  Much contemporary protein folding
              research  concerns molten globules, partly folded states of proteins  stable at
              equilibrium.  Molten globules are generally  considered to represent
              conformations on the protein folding  pathway. The research plan is divided
              into three separate  stages, the first, which is being funded under this
              program,  is to create mutant forms of hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL)  and
              characterize their biochemical and cell biological  properties. Structural and
              energetic studies of the mutants  are to be conducted during the second and
              third phases which  will be funded elsewhere.  ***
