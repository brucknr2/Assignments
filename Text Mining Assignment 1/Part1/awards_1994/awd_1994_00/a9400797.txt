Abstract    :
              9400797  Herb       Herb will continue her work in the field of representation 
              theory and harmonic analysis on reductive p-adic groups.  She  will concentrate
              on studying the most important invariant  distributions on these groups, namely
              tempered characters and  orbital integrals.  Specific problems which she is
              interested in  include computing Fourier inversion formulas for orbital 
              integrals, and studying reducibility of induced representations  for non
              connected groups.       The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the
              Norwegian  mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in 
              twentieth century mathematics.  As the mathematical vehicle for  exploiting the
              symmetries inherent in a system, the  representation theory of Lie groups has
              had a profound impact  upon mathematics itself, particularly in analysis and
              number  theory, and upon theoretical physics, especially quantum  mechanics and
              elementary particle physics.  ***
