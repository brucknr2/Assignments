Abstract    :
              Lazarsfeld       Professor Lazarsfeld will investigate geometric and algebraic 
              properties of linear series on higher dimensional varieties. In  particular he
              hopes to prove the higher dimensional analogue of  Fujita's conjecture. He also
              hopes to work on syzygies of smooth  surfaces and Sheshadri constants on higher
              dimensional varieties.       This is research in the field of algebraic
              geometry. Algebraic  geometry is one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics,
              but  one which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-  century.
              In its origin, it treated figures that could be defined  in the plane by the
              simplest equations, namely polynomials.  Nowadays the field makes use of
              methods not only from algebra,  but from analysis and topology, and conversely
              is finding  application in those fields as well as in physics, theoretical 
              computer science, and robotics.  ***
