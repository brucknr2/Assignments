Abstract    :
              9400802  Benatar       The goal of this research is to improve our understanding
              of  the joining of thermoplastics and curing of thermoset polymers and 
              composites using intrinsically conductive polymers (ICPs).  The  research will
              cover three areas:  the development of experimental  protocols and the
              modelling of microwave, dielectric, induction,  and resistance welding of
              plastics and composites using ICPs, the  development of a predictive model for
              charge transport and  electromagnetic radiation response mechanisms and their
              relation to  the molecular structure and morphology of the conductive polymer, 
              and the development of a variety of heating elements using  intrinsically
              conductive polymers and the measurement and modelling  of the relationship
              between the macroscopic structure of these  elements and their electrical,
              rheological, and mechanical  properties.       The welding and adhesive bonding
              of plastics and composites  are desirable because they minimize added weight,
              provide uniform  load distribution at the joint, and are economical.
