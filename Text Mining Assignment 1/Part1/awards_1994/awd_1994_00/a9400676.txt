Abstract    :
              9400676  Heitsch       Professor Heitsch will continue research on Bismut 
              superconnections and the Chern character for operators defined  along leaves of
              a foliation. Further collaboration with C.Lazarov  will be done on the
              extension of analytic invariants for compact  manifolds to invariants of
              foliations and of open manifolds, with  special emphasis on torsion invariants.
              A development will be  made of coarse cohomology and coarse invariants for maps
              of  topological spaces. The geometry of foliations will also be  investigated
              through the indices of transversally  ellipticoperators.       Geometric
              objects are often classified by determining  whether they can be mapped or
              deformed into standard  geometric objects. Certain geometric invariants, for
              example, the  number of "holes" are preserved under such maps. This project 
              involves invariants for geometric objects called foliations that  have a "leaf"
              structure. Cohomology produces these invariants by  considering the global
              object as patched together from pieces.  The successful completion of this
              project will help complete  theclassification problem in geometry.  ***
