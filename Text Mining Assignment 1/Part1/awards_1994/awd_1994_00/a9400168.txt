Abstract    :
              9400168  Michael F. A'Hearn    Dr. A'Hearn and his colleagues plan to expand
              their normal observational  program on comets and asteroids in order to carry
              out an extensive effort for  Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 and its impact onto
              Jupiter.  They are emphasizing  the study of the dust grains in the coma and
              tail, which together are a  system much larger than the entire Jovian system. 
              Observations will be  conducted during the spring of 1994 to elucidate the
              properties of the  grains.  The investigators will then carry out a program of
              coronagraphic  imaging and spectroscopy during the several weeks surrounding
              the period  when the major fragments will impact the planet.  This will be
              aimed at  determining the interaction of the grains (and any gas) with the 
              magnetosphere and ring and torus of Jupiter.
