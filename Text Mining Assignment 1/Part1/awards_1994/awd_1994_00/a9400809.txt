Abstract    :
              9400809  Ainley  Seabird studies will be conducted in conjunction with a
              physical   oceanographic cruise that will take place in the Amundsen and 
              Bellingshausen seas during February and March 1994.  The  objectives of the
              oceanography and design of the cruise track  offers an unparalleled opportunity
              to investigate the region's  avifauna, which never before has been described,
              but more  importantly to use a new technique to resolve an apparent 
              inconsistency in the extent to which the pack-ice edge and the  Antarctic Slope
              Front affects pelagic densities of top trophic  predators in the Southern
              Ocean.  The cruise constitutes the  first modern oceanographic investigation of
              the Bellingshausen  and Amundsen seas, fully one-third of the circumference of 
              Antarctica.  Three hypotheses will be tested: (i) when a shelf-  break front is
              present, seabird biomass will be elevated above  that of adjacent waters; (ii)
              the elevated biomass of seabirds at  the ice edge is a function of an increase
              in abundance of the  bird's prey in response to increased phytoplankton
              concentration;  and/or (iii) the elevated biomass of seabirds at the ice edge
              is  an artifact of sampling dependent on ship speed and direction  relative to
              that of the birds.  Data would complement those taken  in the tropical and
              temperate Pacific, allowing for a better  understanding of the adaptations of
              birds to life in polar  regions.  Overall, our research results will increase
              our  understanding of how marine birds use wind as an energy source,  providing
              further insight into the environmental factors that  structure communities of
              these top-trophic predators.  ***
