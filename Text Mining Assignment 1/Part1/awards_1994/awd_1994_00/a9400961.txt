Abstract    :
              9400961  Sengupta       The project involves an investigation of several 
              mathematical problems arising from gauge theory (or Yang Mills  theory) on
              compact surfaces. The first project is to construct a  certain measure on an
              infinite dimensional non-linear space (of  certain geometric objects which
              represent the physical concept of  gauge fields); the next objective is to
              solve a number of  concrete problems related to this measure. Some of these 
              questions involve the "moduli space of flat connections", a space  whose
              structure has been of interest in mathematics from other  points of view and
              has involved deep questions.       Gauge theories are used to describe the
              interactions of the  fundamental constituents of matter. While these theories
              arise in  physics, they involve many elegant and deep geometric ideas in 
              mathematics. When combined with quantum field theory to obtain a  more
              realistic description of nature, gauge theories give rise to  more complex
              mathematical questions. Such questions are of  intrinsic mathematical value
              even in situations where there is no  immediate physical significance of the
              question. The present  proposal addresses mathematical problems of this nature.
              The  problems involve ideas from a variety of mathematical  disciplines,
              including topology, geometry and probability theory.  ***
