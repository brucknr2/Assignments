Abstract    :
              9400610  Rensselaer Polytech Inst.  Georges Belfort    The surface of a
              commercially available polymeric membrane material, poly(arylsulfone), will be
              modified in order to reduce fouling when exposed to proteins during filtration.
               Two different approaches of surface modification will be investigated.  One
              approach will use a novel photochemical method of grafting different monomers
              on the surface of poly(arylsulfone) non-porous films and membranes.  The other
              method will involve low temperature plasma treatment with a series of monomers
              under varying conditions.  The modified surfaces will be characterized using
              appropriate analytical techniques.  The filtration performance of the modified
              membranes which show most potential will be evaluated.    The correlation of
              surface properties to membrane filtration performance may lead to the design of
              membranes with low fouling due to protein adsorption.  Effective reduction of
              membrane fouling is necessary for the wide scale application of membrane
              separations in various area including biotechnology, water treatment and hence
              civil infrastructure, and manufacturing.
