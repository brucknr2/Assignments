Abstract    :
              9400766  Xia       The project involves work in three directions. First work is 
              proposed on finding complete unitary invariants for operator  tuples. The
              operators in these tuples commute and are chosen from  classes of non-normal
              operators with trace class  self-commutators. The goal is to derive trace
              formulae for  products of commutators and to establish some K-theory related to
               the cyclic cohomology associated with almost commuting operators.  The second
              problem is to study the operators of the form P+Q  where P is a partial
              differential operator. The project here is  to derive results on the cyclic
              cohomology associated with a  product of twisted commutators for this type of
              perturbation and  to study the related spectral analysis. The final project is
              to  study the Gelfand-Fuks cohomology of a Poisson algebra and its  quantized
              version.       This is a project on operator theory. The roots of this  project
              can be traced back to mathematical physics and the study  of the electron. The
              behavior of the electron was modeled by a  pair of mathematical objects called
              operators. The states of the  electron are determined by the "spectra" of the
              operators. Here  the project involves a study of tuples of operators that are 
              similar to the pair studied in quantum mechanics. The results  will have
              applications to quantum mechanics and the mathematical  areas of
              pseudo-differential operators and algebraic geometry.  ***
