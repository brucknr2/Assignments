              experiemental research including literature review, hypothesis  generation,
              data collection, data organization, statistical  analysis, and writing of
              papers.  Student experiencess will be  enriched by weekly research seminars
              where assigned readings will  be discussed, and by weekly sessions on problems
              or research  design and statistics in experimental psychology.    This award
              contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to  attract talented
              students into careers in science through active  undergraduate research
              experiences.  ***
