Abstract    :
              9400195  Maxwell    The aim of the research of this project is to find a
              combination of  piezoelectric materials and surface mount electronics that, in
              a  unique geometry, will produce a reliable Large Tactile Computer  Controlled
              Array suitable for a full page Braille display.  The  choice of piezoelectric
              materials and geometry must produce a  robust design, a design that when mass
              produced is affordable to  the Blind community.    The reliability is a
              particular key aim in that a dense tactile  array can have several thousand
              pins, all of which must work.   Present displays of 40 characters compared to
              the proposed display  of approximately 1000 characters means that the
              manufacturing yield  must be improved by a factor of 25.  Research directed at
              the  piezoelectric ceramic materials to identify the stress/strain,  applied
              electric fields and fixture cycles to predict lifetime  requires finite element
              computer modeling.      To enhance the manufacturability and reliability, a
              geometric  modular approach incorporating planar element rather than stacked 
              cantilever actuators is required.  Thus the Large Array will be  made from many
              small, flat, identical, mass produced modules.    ***
