Abstract    :
              9400261  Jakus    The objectives of this proposal are to develop new processing 
              technologies for the generation of comprehensive residual surface  stresses in
              ceramic components and to evaluate the effects of  controlled residual stress
              gradients on quasisatic and dynamic  damage resistance of residual stress
              strengthened functionally  gradient ceramic materials.  By using special
              processing methods  the surface layers of specimens will be made to densify
              faster than  the interior, causing these layers to undergo creep deformation at
               the densification of the interior.  By using the appropriate  temperature and
              load conditions the functionally gradient ceramic  materials can be produced. 
              The proposed research will be conducted  in collaboration with NRC Italy, NIST
              and Norton CO.    %%%    The objectives of this proposal are to develop new and
              novel  processing approach for understanding and developing the new  generation
              of functionally gradient ceramics.  The proposed  research has potential and
              will contribute to the National Science  Foundation Advance Structural
              Materials program.  ***
