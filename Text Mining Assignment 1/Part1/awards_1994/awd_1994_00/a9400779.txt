Abstract    :
              9400779  Inger    To help determine the nature and extent of amphibian declines 
                   throughout the world and to promote means by which declines can  be halted
              or reversed, a workshop is proposed to provide resident  biologists with the
              expertise to assess amphibian populations in  tropical South East Asia while
              sizable portions of forests still  remain intact.    The objectives of the
              workshop are:    (1)  Stimulate development of a program on measuring and 
              monitoring amphibian populations in Southeast Asia by resident  biologists. 
              (2)  Acquaint resident biologists with the methods and data  requirements for
              assessing and monitoring populations of  amphibians.  (3)  Promote
              communication among region and American biologists  so as to promote long
              cooperation and correspondence of methods  used in studies across the region. 
              (4)  Integrate biologists in Southeast Asia with the global  network organized
              by the Task Force on Declining Amphibian  Populations.
