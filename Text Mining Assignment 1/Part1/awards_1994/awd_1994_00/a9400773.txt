Abstract    :
                We present a user interface paradigm for database management  systems that is
              motivated by scientific visualization applications.   Our graphical user
              interface includes a "boxes and arrows" notation  for database access and a
              flight simulator model of movement  through information space.  We also provide
              means to specify a  hierarchy of abstracts of data of different types and
              resolutions,  so that a "zoom" capability can be supported.  The underlying
              DBMS  support for this system is described and includes the compilation  of
              query plans into megaplans, new algorithms for data buffering,  and provisions
              for a guaranteed rate of data delivery.  This  proposal requests resources to
              continue the exploration of these  topics and to build a prototype
              implementation of our ideas, which  we have named Tioga.
