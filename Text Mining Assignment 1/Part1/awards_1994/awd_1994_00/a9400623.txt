Abstract    :
              9400623  Tivey       In this project the PI will conduct a field study to
              measure  magnetization of the crust where the Jaramillo/Matuyama boundary 
              intersects the Blanco scarp and of the adjacent seafloor.  He  will do this by
              progressively increasing the resolution of  measurements through repeat
              surveying of the same transect using  surface magnetic measurements to deep-tow
              measurements and then  finally ALVIN measurements.  The primary purpose of this
              study is  to determine the source for marine magnetic anomalies.  This  study
              will also provide constraints on the time dimension of the  origin of oceanic
              crust.  ***
