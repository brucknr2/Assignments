Abstract    :
              9400754  Miller       This award provides renewed funding for a Research 
              Experiences for Undergraduates award in the mathematical  sciences.  Ten
              undergraduate students will participate in an  eight week program, having been
              selected from applicants in a  nationwide search.  Following a period of
              introductory lectures  and computer familiarization, students will begin their
              research  concentration focusing on problems having a common theme.  This 
              year's activity is based on computational and combinatorial  aspects of group
              theory with applications to geometry and  topology.  Students will be divided
              into small groups, each  working under supervision of at least one faculty
              advisor.  Graduate students will also be involved in mentoring activities, 
              bringing their experience and closeness of age to assist students  not only
              with their research but also to give them first hand  advice regarding the
              graduate experience.       Each team will prepare a final written report and
              each  undergraduate must make an oral presentation.  Those achieving  the most
              success will be encouraged to participate in regional or  national meetings of
              professional societies.  ***
