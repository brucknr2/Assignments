              NCR9400762  University of Kentucky Research Foundation  Building Tools for
              Secure High Volume Communication  $153833    This grant will support new and
              continued research on pseudorandom  sequences and their applications to
              communications systems, cryptography,  and coding theory.  The objective is to
              investigate properties of  pseudorandom sequences generated by various types of
              nonlinear feedback  shift registers.  these sequences are widely used in
              cryptography, spread  spectrum communications systems, and other communications
              related  applications, and are closely related to error correcting codes.  The
              first  theme of the work involves the investigation of sequences generated by
              an  exciting new class of feedback shift registers, Feedback and Carry Shift 
              registers (FCSRs), which are based on algebra over the 2-adic numbers.  These
              registers, recently invented by the principle investigator and his  colleague
              Dr. Mark Goresky, are fast, simple mechanisms that can be used to  generate a
              large class of pseudorandom sequences.  They have been used to  crack a certain
              stream cipher system, and the sequences they generate are  closely related to
              arithmetic codes.  FCSRs tie together research that has  been carried ut in a
              variety of previously unconnected areas.  They have a  rich algebraic structure
              that parallels the algebraic structure of the  widely studied m-sequences. 
              There are many questions to be answered about  these sequences, including
              questions of their cryptographic properties,  their correlation properties, and
              their relation to arithmetic codes.  Of   special interest if the potential for
              generalization to sequences over  arbitrary finite fields, and the application
              of mechanisms for  nonlinearization akin to those applied to linear feedback
              shift registers.  The second theme is the search for large families of
              pseudorandom sequences  for use in practical secure CDMA communications
              systems.  It appears likely  that CDMA and spread spectrum will become the
              standard for many high volume  applications.  A new framework for developing
              sequences with low pairwise  cross correlations and large linear span,
              developed by the principal  investigator, reduces the problem to one of finding
              families of functions  over finite fields with certain properties.
