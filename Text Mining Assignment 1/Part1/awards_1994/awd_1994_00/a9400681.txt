Abstract    :
              9400681  Ehmann       The award is for the development of a computer integrated 
              environment for the automated design, manufacture, and evaluation  of
              micro-drills with helical point geometry.  The new geometry  would offer
              superior cutting performance while, at the same time,  being easier to produce
              than conventional geometries.  Scientific  contributions include theoretical
              advances related to mathematical  modeling of drill point geometry, its
              relation to a grinding model,  algorithms for a computer controlled point
              grinder, and new  quantitative drill performance measures.       The work is
              expected to result in improvements in advanced  micro-drill design,
              manufacturing and evaluation.  The quality and  efficiency of micro-drill
              production and micro-hole drilling  operations in the domestic microelectronic
              industry are expected to  improve.
