Abstract    :
              9400589  Atkinson  A 3 -day conference will address the application of 
              nondestructive evaluation (NDE) methods and equipment to  constructed
              facilities.  The several purposes are to permit state-  of-the-art assessment
              of NDE standards, to enable the  civil/structural community to be aware of the
              capabilities of  present methods, to establish communication between NDE 
              specialist and users, and to identify future needs and potential  of NDE.  The
              conference format will consist of 2  days of  presentation followed by 1 day of
              working group sessions devoted  to discussion and development of standards for
              NDE applied to  civil structures.  Documentation will consist of a proceedings,
               working group reports, and a final report.  ***
