Abstract    :
              9400369  O'Brien  Several methods to polymerize supramolecular assemblies were 
              introduced in the last decade.  Many of these assemblies, e.g.  monolayers,
              liposomes, and multilayers, are two-dimensional  arrays of amphiphiles. 
              Success in the design and reproducible  preperation of new materials from these
              assemblies requires a  clear understanding of the polymerization processes. 
              The  previous studies suppported by NSF-DMR have successfully provided  a basic
              understanding of the nature of linear polymerizations of  amphiphiles in the
              supramolecular fast-diffusion regime.  The new  research to be carried over
              will characterize crosslinking  polymerizations as well as polymerizations in
              the slow-diffusion  regime.  Methods developed in this laboratory will be used
              to  characterize the efficiency of crosslinking in two-dimensional  assemblies
              with newly designed bifunctional molecules.  The rate  and degree of
              polymerization in bilayers will be compared at  temperatures above (fast
              diffusion) and below (slow diffusion)  the main-phase transition temperature of
              the bilayer assembly.  These results of these studies on bilayers will be used
              to design  new monomers for the polymerization of other supramolecular, e.g. 
              discotic liquid crystals.  %%%  The polymerization of supramolecular assemblies
              provides an  effective means to modify their chemical and physical properties 
              to prepare novel materials with particular properties of interest  to both
              biological and material sciences.  The research to date  indicates that
              polymerized supramolecular assemblies are likely  to find utility in
              diagnostics, in the controlled delivery of  reagents and drugs, in the design
              and preparation of stable  assemblies for the efficient transduction of light
              energy, in  surface modification, and for the stabilization of organic 
              zeolites.  ***
