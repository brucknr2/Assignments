Abstract    :
              9400510  Stanton       This award funds the work of Prof. Dennis Stanton in 
              Combinatorics.  Prof. Stanton will study the monotonicity of  integer
              partitions.  Classes of orthogonal polynomials will be  studied as an aid to
              enumeration.  Prof. Stanton will also  investigate questions in representation
              theory,  in particular  the representations of the symmetric and general linear
              groups.   The techniques used on these problems should be both  combinatorial
              and analytic.        This research falls in the broad category of
              combinatorics,  which is one of the most active fields in today's mathematics.
              At  its roots, combinatorics is the study of systematic counting.   Counting
              can be incredibly difficult when the objects are  difficult to list,  and
              combinatorists look for general methods  for overcoming these difficulties. 
              Today's combinatorics makes  use of a wide variety of the most advanced and
              modern  mathematical techniques.  Although its roots go back several 
              centuries, the field has had an explosive development in the past  few decades.
               This growth comes from its importance in  communications and information
              technology and from the success of  modern techniques to problems of counting.
