Abstract    :
              9400987  Wenzl       The research is a continuation of the investigator's 
              construction of examples of hyperfinite subfactors of type II sub  1 using
              braid groups. These subfactors have subsequently found  applications in
              topology (construction of invariants of 3-  manifolds) and category theory
              (classification of tensor  categories whose Grothendieck ring coincides with
              the one of  SU(k) or with related so-called fusion rings). It is planned to 
              study new subfactors obtained from the relation between  invariants of
              3-manifolds and subfactors. Further work will be  done extending the
              investigators classification of subfactors. An  attempt will be made to gain
              insight using the path idempotent  approach for Hecke algebras in the case when
              they are not  semisimple. This has already been applied to a special quotient, 
              the Temperley-Lieb algebra and it seems to have potential for  more general
              cases.       This research is in a very active area of Modern Analysis 
              involving applications of operator algebras to mathematical  physics and
              geometry. A certain abstract algebra invariant  discovered in the mid 1980's by
              V. F. Jones has had surprising  applications to geometry and mathematical
              physics. This project  involves such applications based on specific algebraic
              structures  discovered by Professor Wenzl.  ***
