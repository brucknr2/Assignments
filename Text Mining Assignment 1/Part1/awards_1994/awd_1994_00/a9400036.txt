Abstract    :
              9400036  Sambrotto  Research supported by this grant is under the auspices of
              the Arctic Systems Science (ARCSS) Global Change Research Program and is
              jointly sponsored by the Division of Ocean Sciences and the  Office of Polar
              Programs.  The research will be centered around a unique and intensive,
              multidisciplinary research expedition to parts of the Arctic Ocean that have
              never been extensively studied.  The 1994 U.S./Canada Arctic Ocean Section is a
              collaborative effort with Canada that will involve approximately 60 scientists
              on a Canadian and a U.S. icebreaker during summer 1994.  NSF-funded projects
              will focus on hydrography, biology, paleo-, and sea-ice studies.  Data
              collected will be amongst the first ever from  several regions of the Arctic
              Ocean and will be highly relevant to improving our understanding of how the
              Arctic is an indicator of changing global climate conditions and how it affects
              the physical, chemical, and biological features of the more temperate oceans
              and regions.    This work is a component of the collaborative biology program. 
              Research will be undertaken to investigate the horizontal movement of carbon in
              Arctic waters.  Unlike in ice-free waters where vertical movement of organic
              material through the "biological pump" dominates the carbon flux pathway,
              horizontal movement of organic matter from the large Arctic shelves to the
              interior may be the dominant flux pathway for carbon in Arctic systems. 
              Research will focus on the importance of horizontal carbon flux using
              measurements of the inorganic carbon system, total dissolved inorganic carbon
              (DIC) and dissolved CO2 gas, from which carbonate and alkalinity will be
              derived.  Organic and inorganic carbon production and mineralization rates in
              upper surface waters will be determined and analyzed based on the distribution
              of these variables relative to isopycnal surfaces and water mass age.  These
              measurements complement other on board sampling projects and will facilitate a
              better understanding of carbon flux dynamic s in the Arctic Ocean.  ***
