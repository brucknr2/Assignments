Abstract    :
              9400272  Graf  The Stony Brook REU Physics program will continue.  The program 
              will bring 13 undergraduate students (all but one or two from  other colleges
              and universities) to Stony Brook each summer for  participation in forefront
              physics research in the laboratories  of Stony Brook faculty members. 
              Approximately six Stony Brook  undergraduate students, funded from other
              sources, will also take  part.  The aim of the program is to foster interest
              in, and  appreciation of, scientific research in physics, through doing 
              research in a collegial setting, site visits to research  laboratories weekly
              lectures on current problems in physics and  presentation of results in a
              formal symposium at the conclusion  of the program.  The Physics program is
              part of a larger REU effort at Stony  Brook, encompassing nine other
              departments and supporting a total  of over 70 REU students each summer. 
              Recruiting efforts  concentrate on colleges in which research opportunities are
               limited, and particular efforts are made to attract women and  students from
              under-representated minorities.  ***
