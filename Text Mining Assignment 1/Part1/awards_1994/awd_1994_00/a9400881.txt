Abstract    :
               This project investigates the design and implementation   algorithms for
              nonlinear optimization.  The research focuses   on  the solution of  large
              problems, and has two broad objectives.  The first is   to develop a new 
              algorithm for solving large and  unstructured unconstrained   problems.  This
              work is  motivated by the need of solving   large and nonsparse  problems 
              efficiently.  The new algorithm uses ideas from   both  Newton  methods and
              variable metric updating, and is tested  on large   problems arising in weather
              forecasting.    The second   objective is to study  efficient techniques for 
              handling inequality constraints   occurring in nonlinear  programming.  This
              research focuses on large problems, and   techniques are designed to be useful
              in that case.  The  use   of an  ellipsoidal-type method is explored.  This 
              approach has the   advantage of  leading readily into a sequence of  equality
              constrained   subproblems which can  be solved by existing  software.  An
              alternative approach,   which consists of  extending  the primal-dual method of
              linear programming to   the nonlinear  case,  is also explored.  The algorithm
              is posed in the  framework   of trust  region methods, and its relationship
              with  sequential   quadratic programming is  fully exploited.  The  two new
              approaches for handling   constraints are tested on a set of large problems,
              and the   treatment of  ill-conditioning receives careful consideration.
