Abstract    :
              9400673  Rosenberg       Research in the structure and scattering of atomic
              systems,  their interaction with radiation and with fundamental atomic  forces,
              the so-called "Casimir forces" will be continued and  extended to new physical
              situations.  Mathematical techniques  involving the formulation of variational
              principles, minimum  principles, and semi-classical approaches etc. will be
              developed  to attack problems involving long-range forces, laser-matter 
              interactions and QED.  The approaches involve a mix of formalism  and
              computation useful for training graduate students and  postdoctorals in modern
              atomic theory.  ***
