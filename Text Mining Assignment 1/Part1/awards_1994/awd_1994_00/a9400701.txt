Abstract    :
              9400701  Ramond   A physics workshop on "Yukawa Couplings and the Origins of
              Mass" will be held February 11-13, 1994 at the University of Florida.  The
              workshop will address the question of the origin and the observed pattern of
              the masses of the elementary particles.  The question is a great puzzle, and
              discussion among experts, which the workshop is designed to encourage is very
              important.  ***
