Abstract    :
              9400873  Gross       Professor Gross will study elliptic threefolds and 
              Calabi-Yau threefolds. In particular he will study deformation  classes of
              Calabi-Yau threefolds with a view to obtaining  classification theorems. He
              also intends to further study the  recently discovered phenomenon of mirror
              symmetry.       This is research in the field of algebraic geometry, yet it 
              directly connects to two of the great advances in theoretical  physics in this
              century--quantum mechanics and general  relativity. Algebraic geometry itself
              is one of the oldest parts  of modern mathematics, but one which has had a
              revolutionary  flowering in the past quarter-century. In its origin, it treated
               figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest  equations, namely
              polynomials. Nowadays the field makes use of  methods not only from algebra,
              but from analysis and topology,  and conversely is finding application in those
              fields as well as  in physics, theoretical computer science, and robotics.
