Abstract    :
              Kleiman            This supports the research of Professors S. Kleiman and  M.
              Artin with Dr. J. Pommersheim as a post-doctoral associate.  Kleiman will
              continue to work on Buchsbaum-Rim multiplicity and  equi-singularity. Artin
              will continue to work on the foundations  of non-commutative algebraic
              geometry. Pommersheim will work on  the connection between toric varieties and
              number theory.            This is research in the field of algebraic geometry 
              broadly conceived. Algebraic geometry itself is one of the oldest  parts of
              modern mathematics, but one which has had a  revolutionary flowering in the
              past quarter-century. In its  origin, it treated figures that could be defined
              in the plane by  the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field
               makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and  topology,
              and conversely is finding application in those fields  as well as in physics,
              theoretical computer science, and  robotics. ***
