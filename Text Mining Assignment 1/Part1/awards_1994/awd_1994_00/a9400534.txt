Abstract    :
              9400534  Littler   The central goal of the research is to inventory and produce
              a scholarly, but user-friendly, treatment of the macroscopic marine plants of
              the Caribbean and adjacent seas, thereby providing a baseline of botanical
              biodiversity that will serve as a model for subsequent studies.  Collectively,
              marine plants comprise a taxonomically broad assemblage of very different
              evolutionary groups that have evolved an astounding variety of life histories,
              external morphologies, internal anatomical features, biochemical constituents,
              and metabolic activities.  The taxonomic breadth of the treatment will be
              synoptic, dealing with six unrelated phyla, including Chlorophyta (the
              ancestors of land plants), Rhodophyta (the most species-rich of marine plant
              groups), Phaeophyta (brown rockweeds), Magnoliophytae (flowering Plants),
              Cyanophyta (the longest evolving group of organisms), and Chrysophyta
              (diatoms).  Every species will be illustrated with one to two in situ color
              photographs accompanied by detailed line illustrations of anatomical characters
              so that species con be "picture keyed".  The critical technical descriptions
              also will be adjacent for confirmation of identifications.  Easily followed
              keys to orders, families, genera, and species will be produced as an initial
              means of arriving at accurate identifications.  The project will focus on large
              macrophytes (many are commercially valuable), which are not easily dispersed
              (particularly the rhizophytic forms attached in sedimentary substrata), and,
              hence, questions regarding isolation and speciation also can be addressed.  By
              increasing the known sample size and micro habitat information on a large
              scale, the study will reveal patterns of natural selection and speciation of
              value in addressing larger theoretical questions on biogeography and dispersal.
