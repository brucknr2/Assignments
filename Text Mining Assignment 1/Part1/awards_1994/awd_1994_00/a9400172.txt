Abstract    :
              This conference grant funded by programs in the Engineering, Biological  
              Sciences, and Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorates provides  
              partial support for the 1994 Gordon Research Conference on Bio/Analytical  
              Sensors.  This conference, which brings together scientists from diverse  
              scientific fields and geographical locations, will promote new   developments
              in this technologically important field.  Support is   provided to allow the
              participation of young faculty, post-doctorals, and   graduate students, who
              might not otherwise be able to attend this   conference.    This grant will
              enable the participation of young researchers in the 1994   Gordon Research
              Conference on Bio/Analytical Sensors.  Developments in   this area could have
              wide-ranging impacts in environmental, biological,   and health-related
              sciences.
