Abstract    :
              This continues research involving limit theorems for real and  vector valued
              random variables.  Problems related to the central  limit theorem and the law
              of the iterated logarithm motivated by  trimming and self-normalizations will
              be studied.  Limit sets for  random samples of processes, as well as coverage
              problems will be  examined.  A primary focus will be to further examine the
              link  between the small ball problem for Gaussian measures and metric  entropy
              problems.  Empirical processes and precise large  deviation probabilities will
              also be considered.    A central theme in probability, and throughout its
              diverse  applications to problems in engineering, physics, and statistics,  is
              the study of limit theorems for partial sums of independent  random variables
              in both finite and infinite dimensional  settings.  This research place
              emphasis on the infinite  dimensional situation and involves a blend of
              functional analysis  and probability theory.  Current work has fallen into
              several  different areas, and includes small ball and large deviation 
              probabilities for Gaussian measures, limit sets for random  samples and related
              coverage problems, and Gaussian chaos  applications to multiple Wiener-Ito
              stochastic integrals.
