Abstract    :
              9400229  Selman  This work will continue the research effort on the 
              computational complexity of feasible computations.  The  objective is to
              distinguish properties of complexity classes  that contain  feasible
              computations from those that do not,  to reveal the rich structure that
              individual complexity  classes, such as NP, appear to have, and to increase 
              understanding of the structural  relations between low-level  complexity
              classes.  The emphasis will be to continue  research on the complexity of
              multivalued computations and  on relations between nonuniform and uniform
              complexity.  The  approach is the standard paradigm of structural complexity, 
              that is, to elicit structural properties of complexity  classes rather than
              analyze individual concrete problems.  ***
