Abstract    :
              9400515  Montgomery           The research entails differential-geometric
              techniques  applied to optimization and related problems in control theory. 
              The theory of distributions is considered as the model of the  control system
              up to feedback equivalence. Singular geodesics  within these systems will be
              analyzed. The research has potential  applications to micromotor systems and
              robotic engineering.
