Abstract    :
                9400975  Hamilton       This award supports mathematical research into
              problems  arising in the modern theory of functions.  A central theme of  this
              theory is the deformation of functions by conjugation with  bijections.  Using
              tools of classical analysis, potential theory,  quasiconformal mapping,
              boundary values of analytic functions,  and conformal mapping two new
              approaches to old questions in the  areas of Riemann surfaces and Complex
              Dynamics have been  developed.  The project will continue to exploit the ideas
              to  prove rigidity results on Julia sets of rational functions.  For  example,
              if the Julia set is a curve then it has the Fatou  property, that is, it is a
              circle or has dimension greater than  one.  For Riemann surfaces work will
              follow on a recent proof of  the general version of the Bers Uniformization
              Theorem to prove a  conjecture of Gromov on the uniqueness of the
              representation.   Other work will focus on n-dimensional bilipschitz mappings
              in  the context of quasiconformal mapping.  In particular efforts  will be made
              to characterize those which arise as reflections  across boundaries of domains.
                    Classical function theory has introduced geometric  techniques which have
              proved to have far wider applicability than  first imagined.  The subject
              exploits the interplay between  geometric interpretation with powerful analytic
              techniques to  yield some of the most complete mathematical results in the
              field  of analysis. In this project, variational techniques and  geometric
              reasoning are expected to lead to results of valuable  physical significance.
