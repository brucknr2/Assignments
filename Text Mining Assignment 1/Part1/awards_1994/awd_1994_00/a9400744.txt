Abstract    :
              9400744  Housner  This project provides partial support of the First World 
              Conference on Structural Control (1WCSC)which is planned for  convening in Los
              Angeles during the period 3-5 August 1994.  The  US Panel on Structural Control
              Researches co-sponsoring the 1WCSC  with the Japan Panel on Structural Response
              Control.    The Panel. which was established in 1990, is charged wit the 
              following responsibilities: (1) facilitating the transmission of  information
              concerning state-of-the-art developments in the  field; (2)identifying and
              prioritizing needed research and  development; (3) developing preliminary plans
              for analytical and  experimental advancement in the field; and (4) developing
              plans  for the performance of full-scale testing and demonstration.    The
              Panel has assisted in convening several major workshops to  define the research
              directions and in NSF's Structural Control  Initiative.  The convening of 1WCSC
              will maintain the leadership  of the U.S. Panel in the international arena that
              is related to  the field of smart materials and systems an essential technology
               area for the U.S. scientific community to be competitive in.  Furthermore, the
              joint funding and sponsorship of the Conference  with Japan will strengthen and
              develop new, major collaborative  efforts between the U.S. and Japan
              researchers in the emerging  fields covered by the Conference.  ***
