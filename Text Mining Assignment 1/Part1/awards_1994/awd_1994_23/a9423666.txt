Abstract    :
              9423666  Cronin-Golomb  The object of this research is to investigate the use of
              plasma enhanced  metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (PE-CVD) grown
              electro-optic and  photorefractive thin films as nonlinear optical waveguide
              devices.  Potential applications include compact self-aligning reconfigurable
              optical  interconnects and switches and compact high speed electrooptic
              modulators.    This Tufts University/NZ Applied Technologies project will be
              performed as  a collaboration between university researchers with expertise in 
              photorefractive nonlinear optics and researchers in industry with expertise  in
              perovskite PE-CVD. The first part of the project will be devoted to  developing
              PE-CVD grown epitaxial films of the ferroelectric perovskites  barium titanate
              and strontium barium niobate. The films will be evaluated  as waveguides,
              figures of merit for photorefractive and electro-optic  response will be
              determined, and their use as phase conjugate mirrors and  beam couplers will be
              studied. The films will be grown on various  substrates to determine those
              which might be suitable for direct  integration of photorefractive thin film
              devices into optoelectronic integrated circuits.  ***
