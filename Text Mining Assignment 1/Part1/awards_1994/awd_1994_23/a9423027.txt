Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                       With
              funding from the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Foote of UCLA will
              continue to  elaborate the mechanisms of photooxidations.  In addition to
              investigating the details of singlet  oxygen, the research group will
              investigate the processes involved in the reaction of singlet  oxygen with
              substrates such as sulfides, dienes, alkenes, fullerenes, and organometallic 
              compounds.      The results of this work address the effects of oxygen on
              materials such as coatings, fabrics,  foods, and biological materials in
              general.  This research endeavor has broad significance  regarding degradation
              reactions and inhibition of degradation reactions of substances common  to man.
