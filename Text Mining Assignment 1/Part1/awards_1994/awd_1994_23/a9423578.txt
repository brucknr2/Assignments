Abstract    :
              9423578  Cronin       This is a proposal by an Professor James Cronin of the 
              physics department of the University of Chicago for partial  support of a
              workshop at Fermilab to design a Giant  Airshower Array to look for the very
              highest energy cosmic  rays.  The workshop will take place from Jan 30 to July
              31,  1995.  The objective of the design group is to determine the  technology
              to be used in the detector and to prepare a  sufficiently mature design so that
              a proposal can be  prepared for funding the construction of the detector.  ***
