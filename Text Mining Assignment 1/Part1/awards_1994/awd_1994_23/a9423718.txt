Abstract    :
                  9423718  WILSON   Rapid growth is beneficial to animals because large size
              gives advantages in competing with other animals, reproduction, and avoiding
              predators.  The practical benefits of rapid growth in domestic animals is
              obvious in terms of dairy, egg, and meat production.  Nonetheless, few
              organisms in their natural environment grow as fast as they are capable,
              suggesting there are negative effects.  Although the positive effects of rapid
              growth are very well known, almost nothing is known about the negative effects.
               This study will examine the benefits of rapid growth and possible constraints
              on growth rate in a common sport fish, the pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis
              gibbosus).  Some populations of pumpkinseed show a rapid juvenile growth rate
              in response to competition with bluegill sunfish (L. macrochirus).  Fish from
              these populations will be compared with fish from lakes without bluegill
              competitors (and known to grow more slowly) to determine what effects rapid
              growth has had on:  a) risk-taking to obtain food,  b) slowed or compromised
              skeletal development,  c) decreased ability to store lipids for the first
              winter of life, and  d) decreased immune response to both bacterial and
              parasitic infection.
