Abstract    :
              9423749  Lepore  This project has the goal to provide a new class of 
              construction/building material from the inclusion of buff rubber  into portland
              cement, fine and coarse aggregate mixture.  The  material has unique properties
              that allow the concrete material  to function in more nontraditional
              environments.  The research  will also contribute to understanding the coupling
              agents between  incompatible materials.  Considering the current waste tire 
              problem, the project is expected to contribute new alternatives  toward
              providing significant improvements to the environment.  ***
