Abstract    :
              9423991  Abramovich           This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II
              project  involves the  research and development of new seismometers based on 
              principles of molecular electronics.  The  progress of seismology  has been
              hampered by the lack of low cost, high performance,  portable,  rugged, easy to
              install, broad frequency band  instruments.  This project is aimed at filling
              this  void.  In Phase  I, problems encountered by previous researchers,
              including these  investigators, have  been overcome, and conceptual prototypes
              were  built.  Field tests showed very close correlation with  STS-s 
              seismometers in recording remote earthquakes.  Phase II theoretical  and
              experimental effort  will be focused on the optimization of all  major
              seismometer characteristics:  transfer function,  self-noise,  transducer
              coefficient, temperature stability, as well as  manufacturability, while 
              maintaining the low cost.  Every prototype  will be subjected to extensive
              laboratory and field  testing at  various locations in the U.S.  The ultimate
              goal is the  implementation of three  seismometer versions:  Basic (noise
              200-400  nm/s, 0.03-5 Hz band); Limited Band Advanced (20-40 nm/s,  0.3-25 
              Hz); Broad Band Advanced (less than 75 nm/s, 0.016-5 Hz).  Special attention 
              will be devoted to the  development of an expanded temperature range 
              instrument for field applications.  A built-in  magnetohydrodynamic  calibrator
              will be developed for the advanced seismometer versions.   An optional 
              PC-based multichannel programmable Seismic Data  Acquisition system will be
              developed with on-board  real-time  keeping and anti-aliasing filtering.  In
              order to facilitate and  expedite the evaluation  of newly developed
              transducers and  seismometers, an inexpensive calibration platform will be
              built.
