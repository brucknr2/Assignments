Abstract    :
              9423101  Glinka    This award provides continuing support for the operation and 
              development of instruments at the Center for High Resolution  Neutron
              Scattering (CHRNS) located at the National Institute  of  Standards  and 
              Technology (NIST) Cold Neutron  Reserach  Facility (CNRF).  This project is
              funded jointly by NSF  and  NIST  to  provide  state-of-the-art cold neutron 
              scattering  instrumentation for the general scientific community.  CHRNS 
              instruments  are available to researchers from universities,  government, and
              industry. CHRNS consists of a 30 meter, high  resolution, Small Angle Neutron
              Scattering (SANS) instrument  and  a  Spin Polarized Inelastic Neutron
              Scattering  (SPINS)  spectrometer.  With this award a new facility will be
              added:  a   Double  Crystal  Diffractometer  (DCD)  for  very   high 
              resolution SANS.  This will extend the upper size  limit  of  the  30  m SANS
              instrument to enable researchers to  examine  microstructural features from 1
              nm to 10 micron.  This  will  provide a capability not available at any other
              neutron user  facility in the world.    The  SANS  instrument is expected to be
               fully  utilized  by  researchers in condensed matter physics, chemistry, 
              biology  and  materials  science.   It will  enable  them  to  obtain 
              structural information on a scale ranging from 1  to  nearly  500 
              nanomicrometers on materials such  as  polymers,  metal  alloys,  ceramics,
              porous media structured fluids and  gels,  biological macromolecules and
              magnetic materials.   In  many  cases  such  measurements cannot be obtained 
              by  any  other  techniques.  %%%  These  instruments will provide
              state-of-the-art  capability  unequaled in this country, and will be
              competitive with  the  best facilities worldwide.  The instruments will be
              operated  in a user mode.  Proposal review and selection will be by an 
              external Program Advisory Committee, with proposal selection  being based on
              scientific merit of the projects proposed.  ***
