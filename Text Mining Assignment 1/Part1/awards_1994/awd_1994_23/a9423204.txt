              Dissertation Improvement Research: Migrations and Agricultural Change:  The
              Case of Smallholder Agriculture in Southern Ecuador    This research
              investigates the impact of migratory strategies, predominantly male, on land
              productivity in the highlands of southern Ecuador.  Ambiguity exists over the
              linkages between migrations and agricultural change.  This research seeks to
              clarify these linkages by explicitly connecting migration to land-use outcomes:
              is household agricultural productivity affected by the type of household
              migratory activity?  The Canar, Ecuador region will serve as the study area. 
              Households that have engaged in long-term international migration as well as
              those active in more localized migration and circulation will be surveyed.  By
              conducting a community-wide land productivity survey, combined with secondary
              sources and oral histories of households representing the dominant migratory
              strategies, the impacts of the migrations can be assessed.  Incorporating labor
              mobility as a factor influencing agricultural use will illuminate the linkages
              between labor mobility and agricultural change, thus contribute to both the
              theories of migration and agricultural change.  The research is directly
              relevant to development efforts because it will provide valuable data
              concerning agricultural change under varying conditions of access to labor and
              money.
