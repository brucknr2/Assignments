Abstract    :
              This is a study of the mesosphere and lower thermosphere using data from the
              Urbana Medium  Frequency radar which has been in continuous operation since
              March, 1991.  Science studies  will focus on investigation of spatial and
              temporal variability of winds, tides and gravity waves  in the mesosphere and
              lower thermosphere at Urbana and the mutual interactions between these 
              components of the motion field.  Coupling with the lower atmosphere will be
              studied by  comparing the gravity wave characterization provided by the MF
              radar with simultaneous  observations of tropospheric wave activity provided by
              a stratosphere-troposphere radar located  near Urbana.  The spatial and
              temporal coherence of short term variability in tidal components  will be
              studied in a collaborative effort involving the MF  radar network stations in
              North  America.  In support of the science studies, analysis technique
              development will be carried out  to determine optimum techniques for extracting
              momentum flux estimates from the MF radar  data using software-based
              interferometry techniques, and theoretical development of radar  scattering
              models will be combined with numerical simulations to address questions that
              still  exist regarding the nature and geophysical interpretation of MF radar
              backscatter.  ***
