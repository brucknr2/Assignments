Abstract    :
              9423737  An experimental and theoretical study of the properties of noise in
              mode-locked fiber lasers, will be conducted.  It is likely that these lasers
              can be made to operate at the quantum limit, at least within certain spectral
              windows, where classical sources of noise are suppressed to an extent that
              quantum noise is predominant noise source.  ***
