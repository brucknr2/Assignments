Abstract    :
                9423846  Edwards    The relationship between the brain and behavior is a
              dynamic  two-way interaction.  Biologists would like to understand  both how
              the brain generates behaviors, and also how  behavioral  contexts produce
              effects on the brain.  It is  well-known that social behaviors produce effects
              on the  brain (and therefore other behaviors), but the mechanisms  for such
              interactions is largely unknown.  In this grant Dr.  Edwards and his colleagues
              will examine how the dominance  status of animals impacts the chemistry of the
              nervous  system and the subsequent expression of  well-defined  behaviors such
              as escape.    The brain chemical serotonin can modify escape behavior.  Dr.
              Edwards group has evidence that serotonin's effects on  brain cells mediating
              escape vary in fundamentally different  ways in dominant animals versus
              subordinate animals.  The  mechanisms for serotonin's differential effects will
              be  analyzed at the level of identified cells and specific  subtypes of the
              serotonin receptor.  This work will provide  new inqights into the pathways by
              which social behavior and  brain function interact.  ***
