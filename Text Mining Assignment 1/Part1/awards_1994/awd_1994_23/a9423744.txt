Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT      AST-9423744  Shelton, Christopher    An adaptive optics system
              working in the visible has been constructed for the 100-inch Hooker telescope
              using private funding sources.  This project will augment the capabilities of
              the basic system, refurbish of the Coude spectrograph at the 100-inch Hooker
              telescope, and provide a fiber feed connection between the Coude spectrograph
              and the corrected starlight output.    ***
