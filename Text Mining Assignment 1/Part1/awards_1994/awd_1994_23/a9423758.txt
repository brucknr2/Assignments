Abstract    :
              This award supports the research of Professor Michael Harris, who  will continue
              to study the arithmetic and geometry of automorphic  forms and representations
              of p-adic groups. Harris intends to  explore the relations of recent
              developments in the field to  special values of automorphic L-functions. He
              will also continue  working on applications of this work to the representation
              theory  of p-adic groups. Further, he will complete projects related to  the
              mixed motives arising in the cohomology of Shimura varieties.      Automorphic
              forms arose out of non-Euclidean geometry in the  middle of the nineteenth
              century. Both mathematicians and  physicists have thus long realized that many
              objects of  fundamental importance are non-Euclidean in their basic nature. 
              This field is principally concerned with questions about the  whole numbers,
              but in its use of geometry and analysis, it  retains connection to its
              historical roots and thus to problems  in areas as diverse as gauge theory in
              theoretical physics and  coding theory in information theory.
