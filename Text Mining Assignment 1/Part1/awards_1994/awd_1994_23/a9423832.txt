Abstract    :
              9423832  Zhou  This proposal proposes to investigate a novel scanning method for
               dc Plasma Display Panel (DCPDP).  The idea is based on the use of  two or more
              electronic beam guns to address and scan it.  This  novel idea will drastically
              reduce the complexity of the scanning  circuitry associated with the PDP.  This
              complexity reduction will  also alleviate the complexity of display panel
              design and  manufacture.  When large size panel's manufacture presents a 
              formidable challenge to the traditional PDP structure and scanning  method,
              implementing our proposed method will be able to simplify  the panel structure
              by eliminating all built-in resistors from each  display cell.  The project is
              of high risk since none has done such  work on using electronic beams to
              address and scan plasma panels.   It can produce a significant impact on the
              large-size flat panel  display industry if this project can succeed in
              verifying the  correctness and feasibility of our original concepts.  Such
              success  will open many R&D issues related to DCPDP design and manufacture.
