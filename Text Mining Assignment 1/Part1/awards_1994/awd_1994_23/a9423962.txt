Abstract    :
              9423962  Michaelson    This award supports a 12-month Japan Society for the 
              Promotion of Science Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. David  Michaelson of the
              University of California in Los Angeles.  This fellowship opportunity will
              facilitate a collaborative  effort between Dr. Michaelson and the laboratory of
              Dr.  Yanagida of Kyoto University to explore a possible link  between the
              control of the yeast cell cycle and  intracellular signaling mechanisms. The
              purpose of this is  to understand how cell division is affected by the external
               environment.    Dr. Yanagida's laboratory is well established in the field  of
              cell-cycle regulation. This provides Dr. Michaelson with  an ideal opportunity
              to study both cell-cycle regulation and  fission yeast genetics in one of the
              leading labs in the  field.  Furthermore, this collaboration provides a rare 
              opportunity to study the interaction between intracellular  signaling
              mechanisms and cell-cycle regulation. Since such  mechanisms also function to
              control cell proliferation and  differentiation in animals, this collaboration
              combines  Dr. Yanagida's expertise in yeast cell-cycle regulation with  Dr.
              Michaelson's interest in the regulation of proliferation  and differentiation
              of animal cells.  ***
