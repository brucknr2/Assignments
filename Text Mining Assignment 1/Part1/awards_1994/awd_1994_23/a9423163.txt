Abstract    :
              This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface  Chemistry
              Program, is concerned with the preparation, properties,  and interactions of
              colloidal dispersions.  A combination of  synthesis and physical
              characterization is used to understand the  properties of matter in this finely
              divided state, particularly the  optical, magnetic, electric, and adsorptive
              properties of these  materials.  Nanoscale particles are synthesized using
              double and  triple jet precipitation methods.  The physical characterization of
               these materials will focus on the adhesion phenomena.    The magnetic and
              optical properties of very finely divided solids  have many practical
              applications in magnetic recording devices,  fillers, and coatings. An
              understanding of the synthesis of these  materials, and a correlation of their
              properties with the  controlled size and morphology of the particles is the
              focus of  this research project.  Chemical synthesis and physical 
              characterization combine to develop an understanding of these  interesting and
              technologically important materials.
