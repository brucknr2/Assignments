Abstract    :
              9423483  HAHN   This project will support shipboard scientific support equipment
                for the research vessel ENDEAVOR, an NSF-owned ship operated by    the
              University of Rhode Island, Graduate School of Oceanography   and dedicated to
              use in support of ocean science research.            The Shipboard Scientific
              Support Equipment Program provides funds  for ship equipment deemed essential
              to the proper and safe      conduct of ocean science research. This Program
              provides support   for such items as deck equipment including winch systems for
              the   deployment and retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational  
              equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and earth satellite      receivers to pin
              point the location of research sites,      communication equipment including
              radio transceivers and      satellite transceivers for voice and scientific
              data      communications and other equipment such as motorized workboats    for
              transporting scientists to and from data retrieval sites.           The Project
              Director, William B. Hahn is fully qualified to   direct this project having
              had considerable experience in   overseeing the acquisition and installation of
              shipboard   equipment.         This project will allow the institution to
              obtain an upgrade  evaluation of the ship's trawl winch, to upgrade winch
              controllers  and the winch selection system, replace gyros, improve bridge wing
               controls, upgrade the deck monitoring video system, replace two  outboard
              motors and two life rafts and obtain a portable computer  and a hose crimping
              tool.  ***
