Abstract    :
              The positive impact of computer-based technology varies in part as a function of
              interface design and  the individual abilities of users.  The primary cognitive
              factor driving differences in performance  using computer-based technology is
              spatial visualization ability.  Four techniques for mitigating the  negative
              impact of low spatial visualization are discussed.  The use of spatial
              metaphors and  graphical user interfaces have been promising, but interface
              apparency, revealing hidden relationships  and showing contingencies, and
              interface manipulatability, allowing users to directly manipulate  objects and
              see intermediate steps, are most likely to benefit individuals with low spatial
               visualization ability.  The current project explores the interface apparency
              and interface  manipulatability.  Two studies will be undertaken in which the
              hidden contingencies of a hierarchical  control structure are revealed through
              a dynamic graphical screen display.  Two additional studies  will be undertaken
              which allow users to manipulate objects through intermediate steps rather than 
              having to infer or visualize those s teps. The results of these experiments and
              the design concepts  that are subsequently suggested by them will help to
              provide interface designers with graphical user  interface techniques that will
              provide gateways through the spatial visualization ability barrier.
