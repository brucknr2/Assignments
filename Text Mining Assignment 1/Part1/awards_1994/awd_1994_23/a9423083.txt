Abstract    :
              9423083  Overhauser  The objective of this project is to acquire a deeper 
              understanding of the interactions between electrons and the  interactions
              between helium 3 atoms in condensed matter.  Applications include one particle
              energy spectra, phase  transformations, collective excitations, dynamic
              scattering  processes, transport phenomena, broken translation symmetry, 
              superconductivity, and the superfluid phases of helium 3.  %%%  This award
              supports the ongoing research of a prominent  investigator who received the
              National Medal Science from  President Clinton in 1994.  He is known for asking
               penetrating, fundamental questions about systems that others  think are
              understood.  He also focuses on resolving major  discrepancies between
              experimental results and previous  theories.  He will investigate eight
              projects which center  on a better understanding of the interactions between 
              electrons or between atoms in various condensed matter  systems.  ***
