Abstract    :
                  9423436  WAGNER   The primary goal of this research program is to examine
              the relationship between the genetic structure of species and the pattern of
              morphological evolution within the fly genus Diasemopsis.  These flies are
              distinct because of the extreme elongation of the head into long eye-stalks. 
              This bizarre morphological transformation may have led to changes in other
              morphological traits as a result of shared genetic effects between traits. 
              Because any given gene may influence a number of different morphological
              traits, selection to change one part of an organism may have a cascade of
              effects on other body parts.  Presently, it is unknown how much this genetic
              connection between body parts directs the course of evolution since it is
              possible this connection can be broken over time.  The first step toward
              answering this question requires comparing the types of genetic connections
              between different species.  If different species show similar genetic structure
              (i.e. different body parts are linked genetically in the same manner in both
              species), this could profoundly influence the course of evolution.  This
              research will examine this possibility in two different species of stalk-eyed
              flies.  In addition, the pattern of shared genetic effects between traits will
              be compared with the pattern of morphological evolution within these flies to
              determine if those genetic connections which have remained fixed between
              species have constrained the divergence of these species.
