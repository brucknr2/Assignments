Abstract    :
              This project is concerned with a novel, cost-effective scheme,  called
              task-based fault tolerance (TBFT), for providing fault  tolerance to
              heterogeneous distributed computing systems.  The  technique considers
              computations at the task level and places  assertion checks on the tasks to
              achieve fault tolerance.  It  requires no hardware overhead and relatively
              small amount of delay  overhead.  Allocation and scheduling of the taks is
              performed in  the task graph to support fault tolerance, while at the same time
               an attempt is made minimize the schedule length and obtain a  balanced load. 
              Simulation results show that the overhead in  schedule length incurred due to
              the introduction of assertion  checks is very small compared with the case when
              all the tasks in  the system are duplicated.  The topics under investigation
              include  the following: (1) applying TBFT techniques to multiple faults, (2) 
              developing mixed allocation/scheduling methods to reduce schedule  length and
              fault tolerance overhead, (3) developing methods to  ensure safety of operation
              without much adverse effect on the  reliability of the system, (4) developing
              allocation and scheduling  methods which would permit the use of redundancy at
              the task level  to provide fast on-line diagnosis, (5) develop probabilistic 
              diagnosis methods, (6) integrating detection/diagnosis results with  a backward
              error recovery method to minimize the rollback domino  effect using
              asynchronous checkpointing, and (7) developing  allocation and scheduling
              methods for periodic and aperiodic tasks  in fault-tolerant real-time
              distributed systems based on the notion  of forward error recovery for
              safety-critical tasks.
