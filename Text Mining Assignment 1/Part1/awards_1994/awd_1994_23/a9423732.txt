Abstract    :
              This research is on techniques for analysis of VLSI interconnect  nets.  Methods
              for predicting capacitance effects in VLSI  circuitry, especially at rounded
              corners, are being investigated  using asymptotic expansions.  Secondly,
              methods to determine the  voltage-current regime of nonlinear networks on a
              chip are being  assessed.  The approach is to model each interconnection
              network as  a cascade of three terminal networks connected together at their 
              ends.  Each cascade can be described mathematically by a nonlinear  operator. 
              Computationally efficient analysis techniques are being  developed.
