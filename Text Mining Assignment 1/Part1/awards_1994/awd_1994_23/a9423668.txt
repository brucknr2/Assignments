Abstract    :
              9423668 Dutta  This research is a comprehensive investigation of creep
              mechanisms in unidirectionally reinforced, continuous fiber, metal-matrix
              composites (MMCs), combining both analytical and experimental approaches.  The
              work is unique in three respects:  (1) it seeks to develop a model, which
              explicitly accounts for strain history, interfacial sliding, and time-dependent
              changes in matrix creep; (2) it seeks mechanistic insight, rather than
              predictive ability, by proposing experimental quantification of the roles of
              the matrix, interface and fiber on the overall creep response; (3) it
              constitutes the only attempt to date at summarizing the stress-temperature-time
              dependence of creep mechanisms in continuous fiber MMCs in the form of
              transient deformation mechanism maps, which are valuable in predicting the
              strain response and dominant deformation mechanisms in composites over a wide
              range of stress and temperature conditions.  The experimental program includes
              a novel approach to monitor damage mechanisms in real time during creep testing
              of composites.  The creep response of continuous fiber composites is complex
              because of progressive transfer of load from the matrix to the fibers,
              resulting in transient behavior which makes mechanistic studies difficult. 
              This is complicated by fiber-matrix interfacial sliding, interaction of
              internal residual stresses with the applied stresses, and changes in the matrix
              deformation mechanism with evolving stress conditions.  Accordingly, a clear
              phenomenological picture of creep in continuous fiber reinforced metal-matrix
              composites (MMC) has not emerged. %%% This project is expected to yield
              substantial fundamental insight on creep mechanisms in continuous fiber MMCs,
              particularly with respect to the roles of matrix and interface deformation.
