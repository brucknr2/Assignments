Abstract    :
                  9423628  ADAMS   Social insects are an ecologically and economically
              important group of organisms.  The structure of social insect colonies has long
              been of interest because workers sacrifice their own reproductive opportunities
              and help raise the offspring of others.  While many studies of colony-level
              genetic relatedness have been conducted on the social ants, bees and wasps,
              little is known about the genetic structure of termite colonies.  It is
              important to learn more about termites because, although their social
              organization is similar to the other social insects, their social structure
              appears to have evolved independently and other aspects of their biology have
              apparently produced relatedness relationships unlike those found in other
              social insects.   This research examines the Neotropical termite Nasutitermes
              corniger, an abundant, destructive and easily collected species that has
              multiple queens and kings in many of its colonies.  Protein and DNA genetic
              markers will be used to examine:  1)  the numbers of reproducing queens and
              kings per colony;   2)  their relatedness;  3)  mating patterns, and  4) 
              offspring production per queen and king.  Genetic structure will be assessed at
              both the colony and population levels.
