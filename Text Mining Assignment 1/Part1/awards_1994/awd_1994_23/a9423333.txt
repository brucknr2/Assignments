Abstract    :
              9423333  Blaustein  An unprecedented loss of the variety and numbers of species
              around the world is currently occurring. A continual loss of biodiversity can
              have significant ecological, economical, social, medical, and ethical
              consequences. Habitat destruction, over-harvesting, chemical pollution,
              introduced exotic species, and climatic change are among the major threats to
              biodiversity. As part of this overall crisis, numerous recent reports have
              suggested that many species within the class amphibia are undergoing population
              declines and range reductions. The causes of these declines in some populations
              are unclear. One factor implicated in amphibian decline is UV-B radiation. This
              research under this conservation and restoration biology award will investigate
              the effects of UV-B radiation on amphibian egg survivorship, hatching success,
              and larval development in field populations in the Pacific Northwest. In
              addition, studies will determine if UV-B interacts with a pathogen to further
              reduce amphibian survivorship. Since conditions likely to promote increased UV
              transmission are now becoming manifest, it is important to examine the effects
              of ambient levels of UV radiation in natural populations of organisms.
              Knowledge from such studies will enable us to take steps to reduce a
              potentially series environmental threat.
