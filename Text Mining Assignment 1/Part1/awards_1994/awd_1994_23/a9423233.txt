              because it contains noval ideas that  need to be tested and which, if proven
              true, would significantly  enhance our understanding of the climate.  The
              proposed research  continues the development of a climate theory based on an 
              hypothesis of Lorenz (1960) that the turbulent wind velocity is the  maximum
              allowed in the earth's atmosphere.  As turbulence  efficiently mixes properties
              that are conserved with fluid motions,  it is further hypothesized that the
              earth's climate may approach  the maximally mixed state characterized by a
              minimum number of  degrees of freedom.  To test this hypothesis, the theory
              thus seeks  to derive this climatic state that is consistent with balance 
              requirements imposed by fundamental conservation laws.    The proposed research
              here constitutes the part of the theory that  derives the atmosphere structure.
               Although this structure may not  be uniquely determined without full closure
              of the system, it is  nevertheless demonstrated that, even without such
              considerations,  the model atmosphere is sufficiently constrained that it
              resembles  the observed atmosphere, including its division into dominant air 
              masses and the distribution of the zonal mean wind.  The theory  thus provides
              a plausible explanation of the general circulation of  the atmosphere that is
              logically closed, i.e. essentially free of  empirical constraints.
