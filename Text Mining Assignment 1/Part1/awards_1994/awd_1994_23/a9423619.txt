Abstract    :
              This project will develop an interdisciplinary, on-line database on
              environmental issues in the U.S. Northwest, for use by teachers, scholars,
              researchers and members of the public who wish to understand their ethical,
              legal, social and scientific aspects.  Called NWEST Values, the database will
              include summary, review, and related publications from a wide range of
              specialists working on social, legal, and scientific questions in the
              environment, and full-text reports from government agencies.  The project team
              will collaborate with researchers in the humanities, social sciences,
              biological and physical sciences, law, mining, agriculture, forestry, and
              environmental engineering.  It will compile an extensive annotated bibliogaphy
              of interdisciplinary references.  The database will specifically include a
              large amount of information relating to Native Americans and to rural concerns.
               Information will be available on-line through the CARL System that links over
              350 libraries nationwide, through Internet worldwide, and diskettes and paper
              copies of the material for those without computer access.
