Abstract    :
                  9423473  LOSOS   While there have many studies of adaptive radiations,
              comparing the characteristics of one species to another, to date there has
              never been an investigation of the role of male vs. female specialization in
              the generation of biological diversity.  Males and females are often very
              different in ecologically important ways, such as extreme differences in body
              size, behavior, diets, or habitat.  To understand diversity and the
              environmental variables important to its maintenance, it is important to
              consider specializations between sexes as well as between species.  Accurately
              understanding the amount and patterns of diversity in the natural world is
              becoming increasingly critical for conservation efforts.  With limited
              resources, management decisions must not only be well informed but also gain
              the most efficiency with the funds and lands available.   This project will
              determine to what extent such specializations contribute to diversity within
              the adaptive radiation of Anolis.  Differences in diet, behavior, body design,
              and habitat use will be compared in fifteen species of Anolis.  Data will be
              collected by behavioral observations, habitat censuses, and examination od
              stomach contents.  The radiations of Anolis have occurred independently on two
              islands, which provides enhanced power to statistical analyses.  In addition,
              the relationships among the species are well-understood.
