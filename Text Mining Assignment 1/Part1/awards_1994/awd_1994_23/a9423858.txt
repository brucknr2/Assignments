Abstract    :
              9423858  Mayo    The goal of this REU Site program is to expose students to the 
              field of metals science/materials engineering at an early stage  in their
              undergraduate careers, preferably at the freshman and  sophomore levels. 
              Sixteen students will participate during an  eleven week summer intern program
              in research projects the theme  of which is "materials processing for optimized
              projects".  Because processing projects are invariably hands-on and produce 
              quick, visible connections between cause and effect, such  projects are ideal
              for stimulating undergraduate interest.  Furthermore, the materials processing
              field is an easy one in  which to integrate students of varying ability levels.
               %%%  It is expected that students participating in state-of-the-art 
              processing research and technology projects will be very  effective agents in
              transferring this technology to industry,  since most students will take
              industrial positions upon  graduation and carry this knowledge with them.
