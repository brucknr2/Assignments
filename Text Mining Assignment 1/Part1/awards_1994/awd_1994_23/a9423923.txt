Abstract    :
              9505363  Saunders  East Coast Computer Algebra Day, will be held at the
              University  of Delaware in Newark, Delaware on Saturday, April 8, l995, will 
              have invited speakers who have made outstanding contributions to  the field of
              computer algebra.  These speakers will anchor the  meeting and will help
              attract participants from the computer  algebra or computational
              scientific/engineering communities from  the eastern half of the US.  The
              invited talks and poster  sessions contributed by the community will cover the
              breadth of  computer algebra: algorithms, software, and applications.  The 
              principle theme of this l995 meeting is applications.    The purpose of this
              meeting is to stimulate interest in and to  enhance understanding of the
              technical aspects of computer  algebra, by providing a way for those in the
              region who are  active or interested in becoming more active in computer
              algebra  to meet with each other in an inexpensive and easily accessible  way. 
              This meeting will be more informal than the annual ISSAC  meetings, with ample
              time for unstructured interaction.  Participation by the region's graduate
              students will be  encouraged through special invitation to contribute to the
              poster  sessions, and through travel support.  ***
