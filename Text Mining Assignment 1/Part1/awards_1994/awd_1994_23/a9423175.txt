Abstract    :
                9423175  Howes    The Center for Grinding Research and Development (CGRD), an
              NSF  Industry/University Cooperative Research Center, seeks funding to  support
              its director on a tour of precision manufacturing  research centers and
              companies in Asia.  The CGRD and its  industrial sponsors recognize that
              grinding technology  development is taking place world wide and that standards
              of  precision in grinding are set on a global rather than a national  scale. 
              The tour of precision manufacturing laboratories and  companies proposed for
              the CGRD director will achieve several  goals.  First, and most significantly,
              it will allow him to  better determine the research paths that would be
              strategically  advantageous for the CGRD and its industrial sponsors to pursue.
                Additionally, the tour is expected to open opportunities for  research
              collaboration between Asian centers and the CGRD and its  industrial sponsors. 
              Through this tour, the director will be  able to access a fund of international
              expertise in grinding and  precision manufacturing hitherto unavailable in the
              U.S.   Finally, the director will explore the possibility of future 
              collaborative projects between the CGRD and these sites.  The report that
              results from this tour will be mf strategic  importance to the NSF as well as
              the Grinding Center.  The CGRD  director has already visited precision
              manufacturing research  facilities in Germany and Japan, and this tour will
              allow him to  produce an analysis that takes into account the major areas of 
              precision manufacturing technology throughout the world.  Such a  document
              could assist the NSF in making policy decision relevant  to its manufacturing
              initiatives.
