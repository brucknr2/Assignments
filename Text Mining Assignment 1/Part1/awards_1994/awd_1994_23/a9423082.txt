Abstract    :
                 Direct methods for solving sparse linear systems are   because of their
              generality and robustness. For linear   systems  arising in  certain
              applications, such as linear programming and  some   engineering applications,
              they are the only  feasible methods   for numerical  factorization.  This
              project is  developing a scalable   parallel direct solver for  solving sparse 
              symmetric-positive definite(SPD) systems of   linear equations,  and is
              investigating its utility and effectiveness in the   context of  linear 
              programming problems and least square problems.    A highly   parallel
              formulation  of the factorization phase of the  direct solver for SPD   systems
              has been  developed.  This is being  extended to the other three phases  
              (ordering, symbolic  factorization and triangular system solving) of a complete
                 scalable parallel  direct solver.    Parallel formulations are being  
              investigated on a variety of  hardware platforms, including traditional MPPs
              such as CM5   and  Cray T3D, as  well as clusters of DEC and IBM workstations. 
              The  parallel   algorithms are being  implemented in a portable form using  a
              programming library   that supports  collective communication, and  will be
              made available to   researchers and  practitioners  elsewhere.
