Abstract    :
              The proposed work includes basic studies of scattering theory of random discrete
               scatterers and rough surfaces with the emphasis on developing electromagnetic
              scattering models that  are valid over a wide frequency range.  Analytical and
              numerical approaches will be developed to study  the following:  1.  Scattering
              by dense media will be studied to examine effective scattering  properties,
              backscattering enhancement and localization with applications to snow and ice
              terrain.  The microstructures of snow and ice and their effects on scattering
              will be studied.  2.  Scattering  by conglomerations of discrete scatterers
              with clustering structures will be studied to examine  collective scattering
              and absorption effects with applications to remote sensing of vegetation and 
              forests.  Electromagnetic scattering by realistic plant structures as grown by
              the Lindenmayer system  will be studied.  3.  Scattering by random rough
              surfaces and backscattering enhancement problems will  be studied with
              applications to remote sensing of soils and oceans.  Problems of multiple
              scales and  multiple slopes as w ell as large incidence angles will be studied.
