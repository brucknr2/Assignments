Abstract    :
              This grant provides funding to purchase shipboard instrumentation in support of
              NSF-funded research.  The instruments will be used aboard the R/V CAPE
              HATTERAS, a 135 foot vessel, which is owned by NSF and operated by the
              University.  Instrumentation to be acquired includes a bench salinometer, an
              altimeter, a radiation sensor, a Multi-corer and digital seismic software.  The
              instrumentation requested is for support of NSF-funded cruises aboard the CAPE
              HATTERAS during 1995 and will enhance the scientific capability of the vessel
              in the future.    ??
