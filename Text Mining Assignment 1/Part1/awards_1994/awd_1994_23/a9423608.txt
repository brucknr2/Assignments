Abstract    :
              9423608  HU, Qing    This project will develop millimeter- and
              submillimeter-wave SIS heterodyne receivers using a novel integrated horn
              antenna structure.  The essential part of this structure is a micromachined
              horn antenna made by anisotropically etching the Si wafers on which the SIS
              devices are fabricated.  Recent work at University of Michigan (using a
              room-temperature Schottky detector at W-band) has shown excellent antenna beam
              patterns and antenna efficiencies for such structures.  Because of the easy
              fabrication associated with photolithography, this structure can be scaled to
              above 1 Thz.  It will also be feasible to construct focal-plane arrays using
              this integrated horn structure .
