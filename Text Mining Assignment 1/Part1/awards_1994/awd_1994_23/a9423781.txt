Abstract    :
                This award will support travel of  10 U.S. participants to a U.S.-France
              Workshop on studies of poor urban youth in France and the United States in
              Berkeley, California, Spring, 1996. The organizers are Manuel Castells,
              University of California, Berkeley and Michel Schiray of the Social and
              Political Sciences Group of the French National Center for Scientific Research.
               The participants include established researchers and graduate students.  The
              workshop addresses current research on the causes, mechanisms and consequences
              of urban marginality in large cities of advanced societies.  In particular, the
              participants will present papers on the social experiences, trajectories and
              strategies of poor youth in French and American metropolitan areas. The
              workshop provides an opportunity for U.S. and French social scientists to
              assess the current state of knowledge and to develop a detailed collaborative
              research agenda.  The participants will discuss the relationship of poor urban
              youth to the educational system, to the urban labor market and to activities
              within the neighborhood.  They will also investigate urban youth responses to
              marginalization, delinquency, street violence, and police and criminal justice
              systems.      This workshop is related to the National Science Foundation's
              Human Capital Initiative.  Specifically it addresses issues that are
              encompassed in two subfields:  (1) Neighborhoods and (2) Poverty. The
              workshop's agenda will identify important topics for fundamental research.
