              Abstract  ATM-9423020  Wright, Herbert E.  University off Minnesota  Title:
              Late-Glacial Climate Transition in the Near East    This research project will
              focus on the nature and timing of late-  glacial climatic transitions in the
              Near East, primarily by stable-  isotope studies of lacustrine carbonates.  Our
              current  understanding of climate change in the region is based on pollen 
              studies conducted before adequate models of insolation-driven  climatic changes
              became available.  Hence, the proposed  investigation is specifically aimed at
              reevaluating past climate  changes in the Near East in terms of changes in
              insolation as well  as the shift in global atmospheric circulation patterns 
              accompanying the retreat of the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets.  
              Stable-isotope stratigraphy of late-glacial to Holocene abrupt  changes in
              moisture-balance will be developed from cores with  carbonate-rich sediments
              from four lakes in little known parts of  the Near East.  The objective is to
              test the coherency of rapid  change along a climatic transect.
