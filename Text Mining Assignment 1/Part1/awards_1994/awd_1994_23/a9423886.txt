Abstract    :
              This research is on automated synthesis of high speed, highly  reliable clock
              distribution networks.  A global clock signal is  required in order to control
              synchronous operations, and it must be  distributed to every register at a
              precise time.  A four phase  top-down design system for synthesizing buffered
              clock distribution  networks is being investigated.  Models of operation which
              include  the effects of process parameter variations on timing are being 
              developed.  Scheduling clock skew is done at the behavioral level  of the
              system.  The clock distribution algorithms are being  included in an integrated
              synthesis system.
