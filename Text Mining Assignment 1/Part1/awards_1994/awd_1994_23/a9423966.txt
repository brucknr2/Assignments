Abstract    :
              The "Research Experiences for Undergraduates" Site will  continue at the 
              University of New Mexico-Los Alamos campus.  This Site focuses on theoretical
              studies and research in  atomic, molecular, and optical physics, using the
              computing  facilities of Los Alamos National Laboratory.  Students are 
              recruited and selected nationally.
