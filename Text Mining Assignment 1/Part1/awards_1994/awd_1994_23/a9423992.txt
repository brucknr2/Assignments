Abstract    :
              9423992  Weitzer  Nationwide and city-specific surveys have consistently found
              that public attitudes toward the police vary by race, with African-Americans
              less favorable than whites.  We have little knowledge of whether these
              attitudes are shaped by the fact that most police departments are largely
              non-minority in composition.  This study examines relations between the police
              and the African-American population of Washington, DC.  Washington is the
              American city with the highest proportion of African-American police officers
              of any of the U.S.'s 50 largest cities.  It provides an appropriate setting for
              examining (1) how blacks and whites perceive and experience policing in a city
              with a predominantly black police force and (2) what factors and policing
              issues have the greatest effect on citizens' attitudes toward the police.  It
              will allow us to draw some conclusions about the extent to which citizen
              attitudes towards the police are affected by the racial composition of their
              police forces.  The study will contribute to theories of police-community
              relations be examining several factors thought to be important in the distinct
              context of a largely black police force.  Its results will also have
              implications for the assessment of police policies and programs such as
              community policing that depend heavily on community support for police law
              enforcement efforts.  In so doing, it will increase our knowledge of an
              important consideration in building safer, more cohesive neighborhoods and
              cities.  ****
