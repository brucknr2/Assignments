Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry   Division
              Professor Kent M. Ervin of the Chemistry Department of the   University of
              Nevada at Reno will undertake a series of investigations to   measure the
              binding energies of adsorbates on transition metal clusters.   These will be
              determined  as function of cluster size, element, charge   state, and adsorbate
              identity.  The experimental methods use guided ion   beam reaction and laser
              photodesorption dynamics techniques.    Surface science studies have provided
              adsorption energies for many   adsorbates at various sites on single crystal
              metal surfaces.  For metal   cluster systems, however, such data are extremely
              limited, especially for   strongly bound adsorbates and reaction intermediates.
               Such data are,   however,  of extreme  importance when cluster reactions are
              to be used   for selective chemistry and for the interpretation of reaction
              mechanisms   taking place at surfaces.  This research project is designed to
              provide   the data necessary for the characterization of the adsorption sites 
              on   the clusters and to interpret kinetic data on cluster reactions in terms  
              of mechanisms and product formation.
