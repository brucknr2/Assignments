Abstract    :
                This award is for support for a two year program to study the origin of
              nitrate in the atmosphere and surface snow at Summit, Greenland.  Preliminary
              results from unfunded pilot studies suggest that nitric acid (HNO3) is not the
              only, and may not even be the major nitrogen species contributing to nitrate
              (NO3-) in summer-time snow at Summit.  Peroxy acetyl nitrate and one or more
              alkyl nitrate species seem to be the most likely candidates, and they may also
              be contributing to the elevated concentrations of organic acids observed just
              above the snow surface at Summit.  Gradient measurements of soluble acidic
              gases will be made with 2 mist chamber samplers at different heights in the
              1995 and 1996 seasons at Summit.  These measurements will be complemented with
              intensive experiments comparing mist chamber samples to nylon filter samples
              and the use of nylon filters on the mist chamber inlet, to quantify soluble
              nitrogen species besides nitric acid.  The primary goal of this study will be
              to enable improved interpretation of the nitrate records in polar ice, but
              additional insights into reactive nitrogen chemistry over snow covered surfaces
              are also anticipated.
