Abstract    :
              The four components of this project span particle acceleration in  solar flares
              as well as the coordination and development of solar  ground-based solar
              observations.  The PI plans to (1) expand  previous analyses showing a direct
              relationship between specific  hard x-ray spectral evolution signatures in
              flares and high-energy  interplanetary proton events; (2) examine properties of
              the 450  unsampled flares to test a proton prediction algorithm previously 
              derived; (3) explore high energy spatial characteristics of these  events to
              gain insight into source geometries; (4) address data  collected during the
              maximum of cycle 22; and (5) employ an REU  assistant in analyzing data for
              rapid optical fluctuations and  linear polarization signatures.  In addition,
              this project will  coordinate ground-based observations in conjunction with new
              space  missions.  Finally, the PI plans to support, in part, numerous 
              observing campaigns.***
