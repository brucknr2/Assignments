Abstract    :
              Under the direction of Professor Gary Downey, Mr. Juan Rogers is examining the
              implementation process of the National Information Infrastructure (NII) from
              the early 1980's to the HPCC Act of 1991.  Initially proposed as a support
              infrastructure for science, the NII became the foundation for a society-wide
              system.  The articulation of key positions in the deliberations incorporated
              background accounts about the nature and role of science, its contribution to
              economic and military supremacy, the role of technology in changing social
              relations and the economy, and the emerging situation after the cultural and
              economic vicissitudes of the 1960's and 1970's among others.  A significant
              consequence of this construction was a connection between science and the
              market in which the former served as a vehicle for creating a free market of
              information while protecting the supercomputer industry.  This study aims to
              account for this process by identifying the participants, their interests and
              perspectives and show how they shaped the resulting framework through their
              interaction.  First, Mr. Rogers is analyzing the US Congress records of
              hearings, agency reports, and legislative action on the subject.  Second, he is
              singling out key individuals and institutions for further study by means of
              interviews and the search for additional documentation.  The final product will
              be offer an account of the dynamics of the process that lasted roughly a
              decade.
