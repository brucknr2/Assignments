Abstract    :
                   This three year project will support undergraduates  involved in research
              projects in molecular  biosciences.  University of Arizona (UA) undergraduates
              and Native  American students from other institutions will receive  support. 
              These students will all be part of UBRP, a large  program designed to involve
              undergraduates in biologically  related research.  Students apply to the
              program designed to  involve undergraduates in biologically related research. 
              Students apply to the program and once selected by a  faculty/student
              committee, can choose to work with any of  204 faculty sponsors, 65 of  whom
              conduct research in  molecular biosciences.  Once selected, students interview 
              prospective faculty sponsors to determine where they will  work.  This insures
              that students work on a project that is  of interest to them and fosters a
              productive working  relationship among the students, faculty and lab groups. 
              In  addition to the research, students participate in lab  meetings and
              seminars.  They receive an orientation that  covers laboratory and radiation
              safety training, animal care  and use, and research ethics.  In addition, the
              program  sponsors optional field trips, lab tours, and social events.  All
              students receive a monthly newsletter.  There is an  annual conference at which
              students present their  experimental results in poster form and students who
              have  their work accepted for presentation at scientific  conferences receive
              travel funds to attend.
