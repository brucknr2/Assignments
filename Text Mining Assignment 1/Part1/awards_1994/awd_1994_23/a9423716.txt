Abstract    :
              9423716  He  Thin metal film applications in electronic devices and circuits are
              topics of great current interest and will be studied.  The goal of this
              research is to obtain a reliable, low-resistivity, thin metal film by LT
              deposition, to attain lower resistance performance.  The planning activities
              are as follows: (1) Prepare uniform, electrical and structural stable LT thin
              films of various conventional contact metals including : Au, Al, Ag, Pd, Ni and
              Cr; (2) Evaluate the resistivity, TCR and their relation to the film thickness
              as well as the film preparation conditions, deposition rate and substrate
              temperature.  Perform the stability test; and (3) Identify the physical and
              chemical structure, as well as the conduction mechanism of the LT thin films,
              correlating microstructural properties with electrical data.  This project will
              also provide a better basic understanding of the electrical and structural
              characteristics of the LT thin films.  ***
