Abstract    :
              9423202  Kennedy  The overall objective of this project is to understand and 
              consequently to control the mechanism of cationic olefin  polymerizations, and
              thus to develop useful novel advanced  materials and processes of readily
              available monomers and  equipment, respectively; the elucidation of 
              structure/property relationships of the materials is an  integral part of the
              project.  This overall objective  embraces four major specific objectives:  1) 
              To explore the  fundamentals and to expand the scope of living carbocationic 
              polymerizations.  Studies will mainly focus on the  elucidation of the active
              living species, expansion to  branched olefins (3-methyl-1-butene,
              4-methyl-1-pentene,  etc.) and conjugated dienes (butadiene, isoprene, etc.),
              and  dollowing up the recent discovery that mixed Friedel-Crafts  coinitiators
              yield living polymerization at temperatures  higher than ambient.  2)  To
              synthesize novel multi-arm star  polymers.  Seed research has shown that
              multi-arm radial  star polyisobutylenes can be made by living cationic 
              polymerization.  This lead will be pursued to include the  preparation of
              polymers with various molecular weights and a  study of viscosity
              characteristics.  3)  To prepare novel  statistical copolymers of
              aliphatic/aromatic olefins,  alkenes/conjugated dienes with controlled
              molecular weights  and microcompositions.  The stated objective could be 
              reached by a new technique the so-called Continuous  Controlled Copolymer
              Composition method. This lead will be  pursued for the preparation of new
              designed copolymers.  4)  To prepare new amphiphilic networks.  Specifically,
              efforts  will be made to prepare membranes with controlled  permeability
              characteristics and new networks that respond  to environmental stimuli (nature
              of solvent, pH).  %%%  This research is significant for the generation of basic
               knowledge  needed for the preparation of new advanced  materials with
              desirable combinations of properties, and for  new multipurpose polymerization
              processes.  A mong possible  applications are motor-oil additives,
              thermoplastic  elastomers, and biomaterials.  ***
