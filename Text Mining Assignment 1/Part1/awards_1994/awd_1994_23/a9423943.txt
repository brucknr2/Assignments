Abstract    :
              9423943  Dershem   The REU program at Hope College is designed to provide
              talented undergraduates with a meaningful research experience that will
              encourage them to consider in computer science research.  The goal is to expose
              the students to the techniques, attitudes, and rewards of computer science
              research and to provide encouragement and direction in the pursuit of such a
              career.  Women and minority students will be strongly recruited.  Six
              participants will be selected each year, three from Hope College and three from
              other institutions.  Those students will work for ten weeks during the summer
              in close collaboration with a Hope faculty mentor.  Students will have the
              opportunity to use the Hope College Computer Science SUN SPARCstation network
              as well as the INMOS transputers.  Areas of research include parallel
              algorithms, system development environments, data communications, voice
              recognition, graphics algorithms, algorithm animation, and programming language
              comparisons.  The students will perform independent research, give oral
              presentations on their work, attend workshops on graduate school, prepare
              scientific papers, and present their work at seminars at their home
              institutions.  ***
