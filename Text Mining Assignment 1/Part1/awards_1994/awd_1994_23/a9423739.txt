Abstract    :
                  9423739  Foley       This is an award for a planning workshop to be held on
              October 31,  1994 in Washington, DC with emphasis on the characterization of 
              viewer/browsers for the World Wide Web (WWW) to support research  and
              dissemination of research results.  Topics covered in the  workshop will
              include, but not be limited to, those aspects of  Mosaic and Mosaic-like
              interfaces to the WWW that would  best support their use by government agencies
              in general, and NSF  in particular, as a means of information dissemination in
              the  spirit of the National Information Infrastructure.  Representatives  of
              different segments of the information, robotics, and intelligent  systems
              research community attend this workshop.  A report of the  proceedings of the
              workshop is to be produced.
