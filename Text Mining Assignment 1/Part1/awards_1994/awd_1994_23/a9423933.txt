Abstract    :
              9423989  Kline   The goal of this program is to increase the number of female
              and minority students in engineering.  This program will provide hands-on
              experience in active, laboratory-based research to undergraduate students in
              mechanical engineering, with 50% of the participants coming from five
              undergraduate institutions and four community colleges in the Detroit area. 
              The students will work actively within large research groups on one of three
              broad research areas:  I) composite materials; ii) biological materials; and
              iii) automotive safety.  The students will develop teaching modules and present
              the results of their independent research to local high school students. 
              Supplementary programs in oral and written communications and ethics will be
              offered, and students will be able to work in industrial research laboratories
              of collaborating firms during a summer internship.  REU students will interact
              with AMP students through annual symposia, a speaker from industry program, and
              the ethics program.  ***
