Abstract    :
              This awards supports summer research by undergraduates at  the Rocky Mountain
              Biological Laboratory (RMBL).  Students  will attend the RMBL where one senior
              investigator will  supervise each student's research participation.  The 10- 
              week program emphasizes various areas of field biology, and  includes
              attendance at seminars and participation in other  group activities.
