Abstract    :
              This research project examines change in the recent "democratic revolutions" in
              central and eastern Europe.  Political stability is dependent on democratic
              values and practices taking hold.  Democratic leaders are hypothesized to be
              both more global and more local in their orientations.  Data are to be
              collected from interviews with political leaders in communities throughout the
              new democracies of eastern and central Europe.  This research, unlike all
              previous work, focuses on local political activity, the impact of
              globalization, and comparisons among new and established democracies.  Change
              will be assessed by comparing leadership interviews with those originally
              collected between 1991 and 1993.
