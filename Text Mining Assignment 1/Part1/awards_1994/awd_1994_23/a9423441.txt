Abstract    :
              9423441  Zielienski  Researchers at the University of New Hampshire will
              investigate the relationship between climate and volcanism by extracting ash
              layers from ice cores recovered by the Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 (GISP2). 
              Large volumes of volcanic material in the atmosphere may affect the global heat
              budget for years.  The relationship of volcanism and climate change, however,
              has not been convincingly demonstrated due to the lack of a data set that
              contains records of both volcanism and climate.  GISP2 ice cores provide such a
              record.    The ash layers will by analyzed geochemically so that the
              "fingerprint" of individual ash layers may be used to determine the volcanic
              center where the eruption occurred.  Once the source of the ash is determined
              and the timing is established by the location of the ash within the well-dated
              ice core, then the relative magnitude of the eruption will be known.  By
              comparing the timing of the volcanic eruptions to the climate record in the ice
              core, the potential impact of large eruptions on climate change may be
              examined.  ***
