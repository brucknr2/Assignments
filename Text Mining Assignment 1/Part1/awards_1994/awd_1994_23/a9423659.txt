Abstract    :
              9423659  Warner  Nuclear reaction cross sections will be measured for the light 
              neutron-rich radioactive nuclei 6He, 8He and 11Li using beams  produced at the
              radioactive beam facilities at Michigan State  University and the University of
              Notre Dame.  Cross sections for  the 2n-separation reaction will also be
              extracted.  These data  will be compared with calculations using the optical,
              strong  absorption, and microscopic models.  Cluster studies will use the  350
              MeV polarized proton beam from the Osaka RCNP cyclotron to  knock
              alpha-particles out of light nuclei, such as 6Li, 12C, and  28Si.  The
              alpha-particle clustering probability and momentum  distribution within the
              nucleus will be determined.  All these  studies will actively involve
              undergraduates, as part of an RUI  program.***
