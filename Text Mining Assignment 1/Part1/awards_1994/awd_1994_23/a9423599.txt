Abstract    :
                      9423599  Wolford  This award will improve technological literacy and
              foster a  better understanding of, and appreciation for, engineering  in the
              United States by melding the talents of leading  engineers with those of the
              television media.  This  collaboration will help Americans understand the
              connection  between technology and human welfare, recognize the  distinctions
              between science and engineering, and help them  to acquire the knowledge they
              need to make informed  decisions in an increasingly technological age.  NSF
              support  will lay the foundation for an expanded engineering advisory  presence
              in Public Television.
