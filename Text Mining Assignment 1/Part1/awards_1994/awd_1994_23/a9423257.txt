Abstract    :
              9423257  KNIGHT    This proposal requests support for shipboard scientific
              support  equipment for the research vessel BLUE FIN, operated by the  Skidaway
              Institute of Oceanography, and dedicated to use in support  of ocean science
              research.    The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides funds 
              for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe conduct  of ocean
              science research.  This Program provides support for such  items as deck
              equipment including winch systems for the deployment  and retrieval of
              scientific instruments, navigational equipment  such as radars, gyroscopes and
              earth satellite receivers to pin  point the location of research sites,
              communication equipment  including radio transceivers and satellite
              transceivers for voice  and scientific data communications and other equipment
              such as  motorized workboats for transporting scientists to and from data 
              retrieval sites.    The Project Director, Lee Knight is fully qualified to
              direct this  project having had considerable experience in overseeing the 
              acquisition and installation of shipboard equipment.    This project will allow
              the institution to replace an inaccurate  anemometer.
