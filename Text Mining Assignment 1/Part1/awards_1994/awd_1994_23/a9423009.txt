Abstract    :
              9423009:  Sudderth  Abstract.   Research is planned in abstract                 
                        gambling theory (a particular formulation of stochastic control), 
              stochastic games, and the foundations of Bayesian statistics.  Part of the
              research aims for a better understanding of a new  algorithm which can be used
              to calculate the optimal reward  function in gambling theory and also to
              calculate the value  function for a large class of two-person, zero-sum   
              stochastic  games. Research is also planned on a class of many-person,    
              noncooperative games that can be used to study questions in the  theory of
              money and financial institutions. Finally, research is  planned on certain   
              problems in the foundations of statistical  inference.   Research is    
              planned on fundamental questions about  how to make optimal decisions    
              through time in the presence of  uncertainty. Abstract gambling theory    
              treats problems in which a  single decision maker seeks to control a    
              process so as to reach a  desired objective. In stochastic games, two or    
              more decision act  to control a process and may have opposing interests.    
              The  mathematical theory of such problems is quite technical, but     solutions
              are of interest in many areas including business,  economics    and operations
              research.
