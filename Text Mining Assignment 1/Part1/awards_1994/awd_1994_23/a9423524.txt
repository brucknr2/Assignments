Abstract    :
                  With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Finlayson-Pitts of
              the University  of California, Irvine will investigate the reaction between
              ozone and organic monolayers at the  air-water interface.  These fundamental
              studies will provide the information necessary for future  elaboration and
              understanding of this area which has significance in both environmental and 
              medical fields.    The air-water interface is prevalent in biological and
              environmental systems.  It is proposed that  the chemistry at these boundaries
              will be unique relative to either of the components (i.e., air  or water). 
              Thus, a clearer understanding of the fundamental processes which occur at this
              type  of interface will be beneficial to mankind as ozone damage to human
              tissue is a major issue.
