Abstract    :
              9423212  Sholkovitz     The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will undertake
              an ocean  sciences instrumentation development project to design, build and 
              test an aerosol collector that would be deployable on buoys.  The  purpose of
              this new instrument is to help derive a better  understanding of the temporal
              and qualitative coupling between  atmospheric deposition of particulates and
              upper ocean chemistry  and biology.  The sampler will feature battery driven
              air pumps,  mass flow meters to monitor filter rate, sequencing sample 
              collectors, and an interface with IMET (Improved Meteorological  Marine
              Measurements) systems.  The aerosol collector will be  designed for both
              discreet time-series and time-integrated samples.   This will provide a mass
              balance check on time series sampling.   Additionally, filters of varying types
              will be tested for  collecting samples of different chemical types.  The system
              will  calibrated with conventional aerosol sampling systems on the AEROCE 
              tower on Bermuda.  This will allow direct comparison with the  aerosols
              collected by the AEROCE high-volume sampler.
