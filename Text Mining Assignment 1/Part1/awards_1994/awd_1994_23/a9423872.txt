Abstract    :
              ***  9423872  Asawa    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
              project will develop a new intrusion alarm module using phase-sensitive
              detection by a multimode graded-index optical fiber communication system.  In
              Phase I a waveguide bimodal launcher was successfully made and tested.  Phase
              II will focus on reduction of opto-electronic noise and extending the
              capability of the graded fiber index system.     Commercial applications are
              expected in highly secure, high data rate optical communication.  ***
