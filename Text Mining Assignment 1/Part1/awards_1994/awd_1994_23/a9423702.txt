Abstract    :
              9423702  Phillies  Polymer solutions are being studied with light-scattering 
              spectroscopy (which is a non-invasive technique for  determining the movements
              of dissolved macromolecules  performing Brownian motion), optical probe
              diffusion (in  which light scattering is used to monitor the diffusion of 
              probe particles through a polymer solution), and rheological  instrumentation. 
              Probes of different sizes, and scattering  experiments at multiple angles, are
              used to examine the  importance of length scale effects in polymer transport. 
              Careful determinations of light scattering spectral  lineshapes will allow
              comparison of phenomena seen in  viscous polymer solutions with phenomena seen
              in simple  solutions near glass transitions.  Experiment, supplemented  with
              analytic theory, computer simulations, and systematic  literature review, will
              be applied in efforts to refine or  refute the hydrodynamic scaling model and
              other treatments  of polymer dynamics.  %%%  The objective of this research is
              to improve scientific  understanding of polymer dynamics (e.g., viscosity, 
              viscoelastic behavior, self-diffusion, rotational diffusion)  in dilute and
              non-dilute solutions.  The dynamics of polymer  solutions are important in a
              wide variety of scientific,  technical, and practical applications, from the
              purely  scientific (diffusion of proteins and mRNAs within living  cells) to
              the mundane (thickness of milkshakes).  ***
