Abstract    :
              9423097  Havrilesky    This project involves an extension of prior research
              supported by  the National Science Foundation by these investigators.  The 
              research program involves the study of political pressures  exerted on
              individual members of the Federal Open  Market  Committee (FOMC) the principal
              policymaking unit of the Federal  Reserve, and the responses of those
              individuals to these  pressures.  The earlier project developed an econometric 
              methodology for estimating monetary policy reaction functions for  individual
              FOMC members.      In this investigation, the researchers update the coding of
              their  data set describing policy preferences of individual FOMC members  using
              the newly released transcripts of post-1`976 meetings.   Using the updated
              data, individuals' reaction function parameters  will be estimated and tests of
              hypotheses concerning political  influences will be undertaken.  This research
              will help to  provide a rigorous descriptive history of monetary policymaking 
              since 1976; it will also provide more current evidence concerning  the internal
              response of the Federal Reserve to its economic and  political environment. 
              The data set created will provide a  useful resource for scholars investigating
              monetary policymaking  in the future.  ***
