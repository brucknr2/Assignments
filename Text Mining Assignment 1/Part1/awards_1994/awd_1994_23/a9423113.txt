Abstract    :
              SBR-9423113  Joseph Tracy    It is widely believed that U.S. collective
              bargaining in the 1980s has changed substantially from earlier decades.  This
              perception is supported by a decline in strike activity, which labor leaders
              argue is due to the increased propensity of firms to permanently replace
              striking workers. This research project examines this claim about the
              bargaining strategy of firms by developing and then empirically testing a
              formal theoretical model of the firm's decision to use replacement workers in
              the course of a labor dispute.  The model is also used to assess the impact of
              various labor policies (e.g., a ban on the replacement of strikers) and to
              study  the impact of the structure of compensation on bargaining outcomes. 
              This research is very timely.  This past year, organized labor lobbyed Congress
              for an amendment to the labor law that would ban the use of permanent
              replacement workers.  Careful consideration of this legislation was hampered by
              the lack of any comprehensive studies of the likely consequences of such a ban.
               This research is designed to fill in this important gap in our knowledge.   
              The work on replacement workers will make use of new U.S. data on replacement
              workers collected for this project and Canadian data on large, private-sector
              contract negotiations from 1967 to 1993.  The work on the impact of the
              structure of compensation will focus on equity sharing plans (ESOPs) and profit
              sharing plans using an extensive data set on ESOPs and new firm level data on
              profit sharing plans in Japan.
