Abstract    :
              9423465  McKinney   The project is a study of the evolutionary relationships
              among dabbling ducks of the genus Anas using molecular mDNA sequence data. The
              molecular phylogeny will be compared with morphologic estimates of phylogeny.
              The evolution of behavioral and plumage characters will then be mapped onto the
              tree and used to test hypotheses of the evolution of breeding behavior,
              parental care strategies, plumage variation and courtship displays.   %%%   The
              study is significant in providing a phylogenetic framework from which to
              address broader questions about the evolution of behavior and the ecology of
              this group of ducks.   ***
