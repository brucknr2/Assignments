Abstract    :
              9423997  Chew     This research will provide basic information on the evolution
              of plant-insect relationships, using a model system of cabbage butterflies and
              Brassica plants.  The different sensitivities of geographic subspecies of a
              butterfly to chemicals in potential hostplants will be examined to explain
              patterns of plant use.  Also, differences between and within populations of
              butterflies will be studied to document the genetic variability in a given
              insect species.  The chemical compounds responsible for acceptance or rejection
              of specific plants will be identified.  Bioassays for effects on egg-laying,
              larval feeding and growth of the insects will be used to isolate the active
              compounds, and the extent to which taste or toxicity are involved will be
              determined.  The results are expected to provide an integrated picture of the
              interactions between plant chemistry and insect responses at different insect
              and plant life stages and with changing resource availability.     This
              research is expected to result in the identification of natural chemical
              compounds that defend plants against insects.  Information on the most
              vulnerable stage of the insects will be obtained, so that an accurate picture
              of plant escape from herbivory may result.  Since the project involves both
              native and introduced insects and plants, predictions about the development of
              new plant-insect associations my be possible.  The research may also determine
              the likelihood that a native insect can adapt to the different chemistry of an
              aggressively spreading naturalized plant.
