Abstract    :
              9423596  Cornell  The project's primary objectives are to develop near-term  (on
              going) and longer-term procedures for succinct,  explicit, yet rigorous,
              representation of the probabilistic  analysis of nonlinear behavior of
              realistic multi-degree-of-  freedom (MDOF) structures and to demonstrate their 
              applicability in the domain of building practice by applying  them as existing
              structures. The concept of the load  reduction factor, R, for
              multidegree-of-freedom structures  will be studied; this R-factor captures the
              post-elastic,  dynamic interaction of the structures and the earthquake 
              record.  This task will determine the degree to which this R  factor depends on
              even magnitude and distance, and hence  when it might require Site-specific
              analysis.  Dependence on  damage measure and frame/foundation issues will also
              be  studied.  In most cases existing (linear single degree-of-  freedom based)
              seismic hazard maps will be adequate for  application of these procedures; may
              contain the dominant  portions of the hazard-related issues.  The procedures
              will  reflect the additional uncertainties in nonlinear response  and capacity.
               The project will provide new understanding  about nonlinear behavior of
              structures and their dependence  on seismological factors.  It will produce
              significant  answers to the building design profession's need for a set  of
              practical procedures; it will provide to current building  design formats that
              are internationally consistent both  mechanically and probabilistically.  ***
