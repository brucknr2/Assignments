Abstract    :
                MARANTZ  This study employs MEG imaging techniques to investigate how the
              brain  represents and uses linguistic categories. Ultimately this research 
              will explore all levels of linguistic analysis from the phonetic to  the
              semantic. The current project starts with phonetic and  phonological categories
              - distinctive features of speech sounds - and  how they are realized during
              speech perception at auditory cortex.   The primary goal of this preliminary
              research is to compare the  brain's reaction to the acoustic as opposed to the
              linguistic  properties of speech. For example, voiced and voiceless stops (in 
              English) are distinguished acoustically by voicing onset time (VOT), a 
              continuous physical dimension.  Perception of speech sounds, however,  isn't
              continuous along the VOT dimension.  Along this dimension,  sounds are heard
              categorically, as belonging to either the voiced or  voiceless categories. 
              Relatively large differences in VOT within a  category are difficult to
              perceive while relatively small differences  that cross the boundary between
              categories are easy to perceive.  It  is clear that the auditory system and
              brain do not map the physically  continuous dimension of VOT linearly, or
              log-linearly as pitch and  loudness are mapped.  Possible neurophysiological
              bases of categorical  perception have been suggested from the results of
              experiments with  animals.  This project asks to what extent the human response
               resembles the animal models and what constitutes linguistic category 
              perception over and above the physical response common to the  mammalian
              auditory system.
