Abstract    :
              The PI will continue his studies of the low latitude ionosphere  using
              incoherent radar measurements, global convection, and  thermospheric and
              ionospheric numerical models.  These studies'  objectives are basic
              understanding of electrodynamic processes  controlling the low latitude and
              equatorial ionospheres, and  developing quiet time global climatological and
              storm time  predictive analytical ionospheric electric field models.  The PIs 
              will use extensive radar measurements from Jicamarca and Arecibo,  and auroral
              magnetic field data to model the response of the low  and equatorial
              ionosphere-to-magnetosphere disturbances.  Fejer  will apply new data analysis
              procedures to examine the low latitude  electrodynamic effects associated with
              high latitude convection  enhancements and substorms, also with storm time wind
              driven  electric fields, followed by large energy depositions into the high 
              latitude ionosphere.  High resolution experiments carried out at  Arecibo and
              Jicamarca will use significantly more data taking and  analysis procedures to
              study coupling of energy and momentum from  lower altitudes into the low
              latitude ionosphere.  Finally, the PIs  will study effects of middle
              atmospheric and mesospheric processes  on the variability of quiet-time
              equatorial plasma drifts using  long period observational campaigns.***
