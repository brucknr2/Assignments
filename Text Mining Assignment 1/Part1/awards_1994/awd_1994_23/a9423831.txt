Abstract    :
              9423831  Sheaff    This  U.S.-Brazil Cooperative Science program award supports 
              the  travel and local expenses of  twelve U.S. scientists  (five instructors
              and seven students) and three Latin  American students , who will be
              participating in the  International School on High Energy Physics (LISHEP95) to
              be  held at the Centro Brasileiro de Pesquisas Fisicas (CBPF),  Rio de Janeiro,
              Brazil, 6-22 February, 1995.  The workshop  is  organized by Dr. Marleigh
              Sheaff, University of  Wisconsin-Madison, and Professor Alberto Franco de Sa 
              Santoro, from the CBPF, Brazil.    LISHEP95 is an international activity that
              builds on current  strengths in Brazil and is expected to have significant 
              impact on the development of high energy physics in  Latin  America.  It  will
              be organized in three sessions:  Session  A, "Particle Physics for High School
              Teachers" will  be held  6-10 February. Session B, "Advanced School on HEP",
              for  which the audience will be advanced graduate students and  young 
              Post-Doctoral Associates, will be held 8-19 February.  Finally, Session C, the
              "cbt Workshop on Heavy Flavor  Physics", aimed at active researchers in the
              field of heavy  quark physics, will be held 20-22 February.    LISHEP will
              contribute to the stated U.S. goal of  internationalizing large science
              projects and is likely to  lead to increased collaborations between U.S.
              scientists and  scientists from the region.  By enhancing existing science 
              programs and highlighting the technological stimulation that  results from
              them, this meeting will help to make the  developing countries in our
              hemisphere stronger scientific  and engineering partners in the future.    ***
