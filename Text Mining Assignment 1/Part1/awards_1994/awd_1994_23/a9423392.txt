              Abstract  ATM-9423392  Brubaker,Linda B.  University of Washington  Title: Late
              Quaternary Climatic and Vegetation History of the          Alaskan North Slope:
              Part II, Analysis of Paleo Records    Beringia (far northwest Canada, Alaska,
              and northeast Siberia) is  an important region of paleoclimate study for the
              NSF program  Paleoclimate of Arctic Lakes and Estuaries (PALE) because it 
              remained unglaciated during the late Quaternary and experienced  extensive
              changes in paleogeography due to changing sea levels.  This research is
              designed to describe the late Quaternary  climate  history of the North Slope
              (ca. 150,000 years BP to present)  through the analysis of proxy climate
              indicators in a suite of lake  sediment cores on the Alaskan North Slope.  The
              research will: 1)  describe temporal and spatial variations in the pollen,
              spores,  plant macrofossils and selected geochemical properties,   2) interpret
              variations in paleoclimate from proxy indicators  (using analytical approaches
              and large modern calibration data sets  for the interpretation of pollen data),
              and 3) infer potential  causes of paleoclimatic variations using a conceptual
              framework of  large scale controls of eastern Beringian climate and climate
              model  simulations as part of ongoing PALE paleoclimate projects.  Results  of
              the proposed research will contribute directly to PALE's goal of  documenting
              circumarctic paleoclimate variability.
