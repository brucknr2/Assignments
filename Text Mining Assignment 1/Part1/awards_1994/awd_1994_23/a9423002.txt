Abstract    :
              9423002  Farrar       Research in theoretical particle physics will be centered
              on  two broad areas in quantum field theory.  The first area is in  computer
              studies of quantum chromodynamics, whose equations are  believed to describe
              the strong forces among elementary  particles.  The second area is in the
              description of the  symmetries between elementary particles and how they evolve
              as a  function of time.  One of the key problems addressed in the  second
              approach is the generation of the asymmetry between matter  and antimatter in
              the early universe.  ***
