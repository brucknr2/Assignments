Abstract    :
              9423681  RABALAIS     This project will supply shipboard scientific support
              equipment    for the research vessel PELICAN operated by the Louisiana    
              Universities Marine Center on behalf of the Louisiana     Universities Marine
              Consortium and dedicated to use in support of  ocean science research.         
                  The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides funds  for ship
              equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe     conduct of ocean science
              research. This Program provides support   for such items as deck equipment
              including winch systems for the   deployment and retrieval of scientific
              instruments, navigational   equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and earth
              satellite      receivers to pin point the location of research sites,     
              communication equipment including radio transceivers and      satellite
              transceivers for voice and scientific data      communications and other
              equipment such as motorized workboats    for transporting scientists to and
              from data retrieval sites.             The Project Director, Steve Rabalais is
              fully qualified to direct  this project having had considerable experience in
              overseeing the  acquisition and installation of shipboard equipment.           
                This project will allow the institution to replace an inadequate  fathometer.
