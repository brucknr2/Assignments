Abstract    :
              9423001  Koch       The goal of the project is to study the interactions of 
              atoms with strong, time-dependent, externally applied fields in  order to
              understand the connections between quantum mechanical  and classical, nonlinear
              dynamics.  These experimental studies  provide a unique window for observing
              the manner in which the  details of quantum spectroscopic measurements may be
              connected to  classical chaos.  ***
