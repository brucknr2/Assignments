Abstract    :
              94-23777  Zang    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
              project investigates a novel 2-Dimensional Spatial Light Modulator (2DSLM)
              utilizing a photochromic protein.  Two-dimensional light modulators are key
              elements in many optical signal processing architectures.  Phase I showed the
              feasibility of using bacteriorhodopson (BR) as a nonlinear Fabry-Perot
              modulator in a new 2DSLM.  BR is an organic molecule that exhibits a large
              optical nonlinearity, can be inexpensively produced, and can be cast as a thin
              film polymer.  Phase II will examine an asymetrical reflection-mode Fabry-Perot
              design, produce mutated BR with optimized properties, and construct an
              integrated device.  Design specifications are expected greatly to exceed those
              of currently available spatial light modulators.  Results of these studies will
              be used in design of a large-scale process to be demonstrated in Phase III
              under private sector support.    Commercial applications of this BRSLM
              technolgy are expected in optical pattern recognition, e.g., fingerprint
              identification, in optical information processing, in neural networks, in
              incoherent/coherent image conversion, and in holographic interconnections.
