Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, Robert   Sharp
              of The University of Michigan at Ann Arbor will study nuclear and   electron
              spin relaxation phenomena of paramagnetic metal ions.    Experimental and
              theoretical work will be conducted to obtain a better   understanding of zero
              field splitting interactions and their effect on   paramagnetic relaxation
              enhancements. A theoretical description of spin   motion and spin relaxation
              phenomena in cases of very strong electron   spin-lattice coupling will be
              developed, and experimental and theoretical   studies of the spin relaxation
              properties of Heisenberg exchange-coupled   polynuclear metal centers will be
              undertaken.  These studies will provide   information relating to the design of
              contrasting agents for Magnetic   Resonance Imaging and structures of
              metallo-enzymes.  Magnetic Resonance Imaging is a widely used diagnostic
              technique.  In   order to obtain the maximum resolution possible at low field
              strengths,   an understanding of the contrast mechanisms is necessary.  This
              research   will provide information which will assist in the design of
              contrasting   agents to enhance image quality and improve sensitivity.
