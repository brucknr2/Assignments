Abstract    :
              9423443  Kremer         The goal of this project is to determine the abundance 
              and distribution of macrozooplankton and fishes in the  Arabia Sea, and to
              estimate their contribution to the  vertical flux of organic matter in these
              environments.  The  monsoonally forced Arabian Sea ecosystem is one of the most
               productive in the world, but with sharp, seasonal contrasts  in production and
              sedimentation.  The system is unusual  in  the distribution and comparison of
              its fauna, and in the  pathways by which surface production is distributed into
              the  water column and sea floor.  The Somali coastal upwelling  zone is a
              productive region supporting a high-biomass, low-  diversity pelagic fauna, and
              the equatorial Indian Ocean is  a typical oligotrophic zone uith a high
              diversity of  inadequately  known species.  Many questions remain to be 
              answered on the role of such processes as egestion and diel  vertical migration
              of large organisms in regulating vertical  fluxes of material in these
              contrasting regimes.       Specific objectives of the study include: 1) 
              determination of distribution and abundance of  macrozooplankton and fishes; 2)
              determination of the extent  and timing of diel vertical migration of
              zooplankton and  fish; 3) examination and quantification of stomach contents 
              and egestion rates of macrozooplankton; 4) use of trawl  collections to provide
              ground-truth calibration of  concurrent acoustic sampling by other
              investigators; and 5)  analysis of the species diversity and zoogeography of 
              macrozooplankton and fishes in the Arabian Sea and adjacent  equatorial Indian
              Ocean.       Our results will contribute to understanding community  structure
              and trophic dynamics in the Arabian Sea and Indian  Ocean pelagic ecosystems. 
              The cruises will be concurrent  with two of the JGOFS Pelagic Process cruises,
              and our data  will bear on JGOFS objectives of measuring and understanding 
              vertical fluxes in the Arabian Sea .
