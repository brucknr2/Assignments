Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is a new cost-effective architecture for  machine
              vision, which will be evaluated for intelligent highway  applications. 
              Components of three smart image sensors are being  developed and integrated
              into a heterogeneous vision system.  The  smart sensors use analog, digital,
              and mixed signal techniques to  perform 3 dimensional measurement for adaptive
              cruise control, lane  detection, and time-to-collision measurements.  All of
              these tasks  are intended for machine vision systems within intelligent 
              vehicles, and will be tested in intelligent vehicle applications  within the
              later stages of the award.  MIT is performing basic  research on the first
              versions of all of these cameras, while later  development, integration, and
              testing will be carried out by  industrial partners.
