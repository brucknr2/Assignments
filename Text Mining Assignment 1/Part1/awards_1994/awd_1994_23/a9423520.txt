Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the understanding of protein folding.  The   work
              to be performed falls within five divisions:   Completion of   templates
              designated as `reporting conformational templates (RCTs)` and   measurement of
              the properties of the basic alanine helices;  construction   of predictive
              algorithms for short peptides and for the effects of   trifluoroethanol;
              testing and elaboration of the Markov hypothesis;    searching for
              high-propensity helical initiation sites; and the synthesis   and study of new
              helical templates. With this renewal award, the   Synthetic Organic Program is
              supporting the research of Dr. Daniel S.   Kemp of the Department of Chemistry
              at the Massachusetts Institute of   technology.  Professor Kemp will focus his
              work on understanding how   proteins fold, converting a highly flexible
              polypeptide chain of ordered   amino acids into a compact, relatively rigid
              structure that can do   cellular work, serving as an enzyme, an antibody, or a
              muscle protein
