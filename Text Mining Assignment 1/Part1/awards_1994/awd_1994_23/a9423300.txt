Abstract    :
              9423300  May       This project encompasses research in a wide variety of topics
               in topology and related areas of algebra, algebraic K-theory and  algebraic
              geometry.  One focus is global algebraic structures in  stable homotopy theory,
              with applications to such topics as  cobordism, topological Hochschild
              homology, and algebraic K-theory.  Another is the study of algebraic and
              topological vector bundles  and of Hochschild homology for algebraic varieties.
               Another is the  study of analytic and combinatorial torsion invariants of 
              manifolds.       Research in algebraic and geometric topology at the University
               of Chicago has for many years explored areas both internal to  topology and
              areas on the borders between topology and algebraic  geometry and differential
              geometry.  Ideas developed here, for  example the notion of an operad, have
              been used in diverse fields,  from mathematical physics to combinatorial group
              theory.  Graduate  students and postdocs involved in the project leave Chicago
              with  especially broad interdisciplinary training and background.  ***
