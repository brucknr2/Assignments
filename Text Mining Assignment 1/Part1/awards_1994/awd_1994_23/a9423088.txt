Abstract    :
              9423088  Carini    This project investigates the microwave conductivity (up to a
               frequency of 20 megahertz) of disordered metals in which the  electrons are
              close to a localization transition, such as ultrathin  metal films and highly
              disordered metal alloys.  Experiments will  compare the dc and microwave
              conductivity as a function of  temperature (T>30mK) and magnetic field (B<8T). 
              Theses  measurements will test the predictions of the scaling theory, which 
              treats the transition as a quantum-critical point where the  temperature, alloy
              concentration, and frequency dependence of the  conductivity are related to the
              same critical length-scale.    % % %    The proposed experiments study the
              transition from the metallic  state to the insulating state that occurs in
              disordered materials  when the electrons become localized in space.  The
              localization  transition occurs because of the wavelike behavior of the
              electrons  as quantum mechanical particles, and yet the transition is a 
              collective  phenomenon where all parts of the system  undergo the  same change
              of state at the same time.  The experiments will  measure the electrical
              conductivity in disordered metals in order  to understand how quantum mechanics
              affects the transition between  the conducting and insulating states.  ***
