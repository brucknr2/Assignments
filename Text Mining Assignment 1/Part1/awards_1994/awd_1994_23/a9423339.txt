Abstract    :
              Many biological systems can be adequately treated by  assuming there is
              homogeneous mixing and reducing the system  to a differential equation.  In
              some systems, however, the  spatial arrangement of individuals and stochastic
              effects  are important.  The principal investigators will use  stochastic
              spatial models to explore  four phenomena in  which these effects play an
              important role:  the  unexpectedly low fraction of heterozygotes for t
              haplotypes  in the common house mouse, the dynamics of hybrid zones  which are
              maintained by heterozygote unfitness, attempts at  using a virus to control the
              spread of chestnut blight, and  competition of various strains of potato virus
              Y.  This  award is being jointly funded by the Computational Biology  Activity,
              the Statistics and Probability, and the Ecological  Studies programs.
