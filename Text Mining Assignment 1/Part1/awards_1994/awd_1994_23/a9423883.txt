Abstract    :
              9423883  Prasad     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
              project will develop a 0.5 watt, diode-pumped lithium sulfur argon fluorine
              (LiSAF) laser, tunable continuously from 780 to 1000 nanometers, with a single
              longitudinal mode (SLM), high spectral purity output.  The innovation in the
              laser system is a three-mirror ring traveling wave main laser cavity, coupled
              to an external ring cavity etalon containing a birefringent tuner (BRT) for
              self-injection locking.  In Phase I an analytical simulation of the system
              found that for an optimal choice of cavity parameters excellent discrimination
              (>104) is achieved with high spectral purity, SLM operation, and BRT tuning. 
              Phase I experiments with a diode-pumped Cr3+ :LiSAF laser yielded high slope
              efficiency, corresponding to an intrinsic efficiency (54%) close to the
              theoretical limit.  Phase II research will focus on cavity coupling parameters,
              self injection locking, cavity length control, and wavelength stabilization. 
              Measurements of laser linewidth and spectral purity will be made.     A broadly
              tunable, single-mode laser has many potential applications in high resolution
              spectroscopy, as an injection seeder for high power lasers, as a laser source
              for lidars used in environmental monitoring and atmospheric measurements, and
              in surgical and diagnostic medical tools.  LiSAF lasers are expected to be
              produced at low cost
