Abstract    :
                  9423693  Shen    This award supports a joint U.S.-China workshop, with the 
              Research Center for Applied Mathematics of Xi'an Jiaotong  University in China,
              on Inertial Manifolds, Approximate Inertial  Manifolds and Related Numerical
              Algorithms at Xi'an Jiaotong  University during the period of June 6-9, 1995.  
               In recent years, the concept of Inertial Manifold has emerged as  an important
              tool for the study of the long-term behavior of  dynamical systems.  In
              parallel to the study of Inertial  Manifolds, extensive research has also been
              conducted on  Approximate Inertial Manifolds and related numerical algorithms. 
               These multi-resolution algorithms, taking into account the  interaction law
              between small-scale and large-scale components of  the underlying flow, are
              especially attractive for long-term  integrations of dissipative evolution
              equations.  The aim of this  workshop is to bring together active researchers
              with different  backgrounds to discuss recent and prospective advances in this 
              area.      Funds are granted for travel expenses of ten participants from  the
              United States and for partial support of the publication cost  for the workshop
              proceedings.
