Abstract    :
              9423912  Ramakrishna    This REU Site award provides an opportunity for twelve 
              undergraduate students to work with faculty members in the  Departments of
              Chemistry/Biochemistry,  Chemical/Bio/Materials Engineering, Electrical
              Engineering,  Physics/Astronomy and Mechanical Engineering on 
              multidisciplinary materials research projects involving the  use of scanning
              probe microscopy (SPM) during a ten week  summer period.  ***  This program is
              designed to serve as a magnet to bring  together undergraduate students from
              different disciplines,  ethnic backgrounds and from institutions where research
               programs are limited.  It will not only provide students  with an opportunity
              to get involved in various aspects of  SPM in material research, but also to
              get acquainted with  present and future needs of the high technology industry
              and  thus help prepare them for the imminent revolution in nano  science,
              engineering and technology. This program is built  on the unique strengths of
              Arizona State University in SPM  interdisciplinary research, commitment to
              excellence in  undergraduate education through federally sponsored programs 
              such as the interdisciplinary undergraduate program in  Materials Science, the
              undergraduate SPM laboratory course  initiative and Coalition to Increase
              Minority Degrees,  intimate contact with industry via the SPM Industrial 
              Associates Program and a close working relationship with the  Maricopa
              Community College System.  The SPM REU site program  is expected to have a
              positive impact on the quality of  science and engineering research experience,
              in particular,  and education in general at the local, regional and national 
              levels.
