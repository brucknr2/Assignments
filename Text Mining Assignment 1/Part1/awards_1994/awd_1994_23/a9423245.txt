Abstract    :
               DMS-9423245 Saffman and Meiron  In the 60s scientists began to  study so called
              weak turbulence which can be described by a so  called kinetic equation for
              waves, similar to the Boltzmann  kinetic equation for particles. Such
              turbulence represents a  dynamics of many dispersive waves weakly interacting
              with each  other (like nonlinear waves on the sea surface). We have found  that
              there is a well defined intermediate situation between weak  and strong
              turbulence which we call {\it semi-strong turbulence}.  In this situation the
              turbulence represents the dynamics of a  system of weakly interacting waves,
              but the wave kinetic equation  is inapplicable, no matter how small the wave
              amplitudes are  (this happens, for example, when the waves are non-dispersive, 
              like acoustic waves).    We are going to develop the theory of  semi-strong
              turbulence from first principles and apply the  results to several practical
              problems, e.g. acoustic turbulence,  the turbulence of shallow water gravity
              waves, the suppression of  short wave turbulence by long waves, angular
              distribution of the  sea wave turbulence, turbulence in optical fibers, 
              magneto-hydrodynamic turbulence, etc. In addition we are going to  implement
              some computational and real experiments to check the  predictions of the
              theory. We also intend to develop a new  formalism for nonlinear waves, which
              will allow us to simplify  the description of semi-strong turbulence.
