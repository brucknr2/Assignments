Abstract    :
              9423684  Templeton   Phylogenetic relationships within the mammalian subfamily
              Antelopinae (Artiodactyla: Bovidae) will be established using DNA sequence
              data.  The resulting cladogram will then be used in conjunction with modern
              comparative methods to address previously proposed systematic, biogeographic
              and adaptationalist hypotheses about antelope evolution.  Specific objectives
              include: 1) testing monophyly at several hierarchical levels including
              monophyly of the subfamily Antelopinae, the tribes Antilopini and Neotragini,
              and the genus Gazella,  2) determining the position of the controversial Asian
              genus Panthalops and Saiga relative to multiple bovid outgroups,  3)
              determining the geographic origin of the Antelopinae and the direction of
              migration between Africa and Eurasia, and 4) testing hypotheses that the
              presence of horns in females arose one and is an adaptation for life in mixed
              sex herds.   %%%   This study will re-evaluate current theories of antelope
              evolution using a phylogenetic framework. The research  addresses long standing
              problems in mammalian biogeography and adaptation.  ***
