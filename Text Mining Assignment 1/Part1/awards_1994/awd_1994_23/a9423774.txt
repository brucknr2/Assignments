Abstract    :
              9423774  Nayfeh  An analytical and experimental investigation is conducted in 
              to the transfer of energy from high-frequency to low-  frequency modes in the
              responses of multi-degree of-freedom  and distributed-parameter dynamic systems
              subjected to  periodic excitations. Exchanges of energy between widely  spaced
              modes are generic to certain classes of nonlinear  systems and because of
              possible dire consequences, e.g.,  instability or chaotic motions, require a
              complete  understanding. This research project demonstrates the energy- 
              transfer phenomenon via relevant experiments; formulation of  analytical models
              to explain the interactions between widely  spaced modes of structures and
              using them to determine  conditions under which energy can be transferred from
              high-  frequency to low-frequency modes, as observed in the  experiments; and
              the use of developed analytical models to  identify possible control schemes to
              suppress these  potentially dangerous transfers of energy.***
