Abstract    :
              This award provides supplemental assistance to increase the amount and quality
              of training in research ethics and professional values in a one-month
              enrichment program with small groups of underrepresented minority students in
              neuroscience, and to increase the number of trainees.  The premise of the
              effort is that advantages derive from placing ethics within the context of the
              standard activities in which emerging scientists must engage -- preparing
              manuscripts for publication, presenting results in public, finding and
              maintaining employment, teaching, and reviewing grants and papers.  Minority
              students need these exposures as much as their majority peers, and additional
              skills with which to achieve professional success in an environment that may
              contain racial and ethnic discrimination.   Furthermore, in a climate where
              reports of scientific misconduct are not infrequent, those involved in the
              conduct of science must take the initiative to bring about  positive change. 
              The workshop occurs at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA. 
              Since 1991, it has incorporated explicit training in responsible scientific
              conduct and other academic survival skills.  The workshop has four interwoven
              parts:  (a) formal instruction in ethics and survival skills, (b) extended
              discussions of specific issues concerning minorities and women, (c) small-group
              research discussions led by workshop faculty, visiting speakers, and members of
              the MBL community, and (d) attendance in a lecture series that is part of one
              of the MBL summer courses.  Results will be evaluated and disseminated in a
              variety of forums.
