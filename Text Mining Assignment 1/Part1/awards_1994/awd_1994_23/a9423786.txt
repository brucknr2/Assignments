Abstract    :
              9423786  Powell    This Doctoral Dissertation Research Award supports a project
              that  uses both game-theoretic modeling and empirical analysis to  investigate
              how various aspects of electoral systems shape the  way in which individuals
              choose to organize themselves into  political parties with particular
              organizational structures.  The  theoretical model relates specific electoral
              rules (e.g.  plurality - "winner take all" rules), threshold requirements, and 
              district magnitudes (e.g. multi-member) to the organizational  structures
              rational self-interested individuals choose to adopt.   By varying these
              components of the electoral system, it is  possible, within the theoretical
              model, to generate hypotheses  about how intra-party organization will differ
              under different  electoral systems.    The empirical analysis seeks to test the
              hypotheses generated  from the theoretical model using three different data
              sources and  methodologies.  These include a statistical analysis of a large 
              data set on electoral systems and party organizations for the  post war
              democracies; the analysis of approximately 30 "quasi-  experiments" drawn from
              actual instances of electoral system  change; and an in-depth case study
              exploring the responses of the  Italian parties to the recent transformation of
              their electoral  system.  ***
