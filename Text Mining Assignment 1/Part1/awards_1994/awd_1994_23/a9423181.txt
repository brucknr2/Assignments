Abstract    :
              In this project jointly funded by Experimental Physical Chemistry and  
              Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, Keith Hodgson of Stanford University   will
              use x-ray absorption spectroscopies to investigate the structure and   function
              of metal ion sites in chemical and biological systems.  Studies    include  the
              effect of metal oxidation state on structure and reactivity   in proteins such
              as quinol oxidase, the mechanism of ligand binding in   nitrogenase,  the
              structural characterization of intermediates in the   methane monooxygenase
              enzyme reaction cycle, and the elucidation of the   structures of inorganic
              cluster complexes and bridged metal assemblies.    Theoretical treatments to
              extend multiple scattering analysis for   chemical systems will also be
              developed and applied to these systems.  Metal sites play a key role in the
              specific function of biological    molecules.  Iron,  an important component of
              hemoglobin,  is also present   in nitrogenase, the molecule which converts
              atmospheric nitrogen to   ammonia, one of nature's fertilizers.  This research
              will determine the   structures, reactivities, and bonding of metal sites in a
              variety of   biologically important systems.  This information  will be
              valuable in   the effort to produce enzymes with  chemical characteristics
              suited to   particular needs such as the environmentally benign production of  
              fertilizer.
