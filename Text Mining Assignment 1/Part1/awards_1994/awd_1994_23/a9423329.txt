Abstract    :
              Abstract  OPP-9423329    This project takes a novel approach to observing and 
              understanding zooplankton patch dynamics, supported by  recent developments in
              both theory and instrumentation.  The  species for this research project are
              the northern boreal  euphasiids Thysanoessa raschii, T. inermis and 
              Meganyctiphanes norvegica.  These are ideal subject  organisms for this study,
              because much is already known  regarding their basic physiology and ecology. 
              Strong diel  and seasonal changes in their physiological activity are  expected
              to provide measurable differences in both  metabolism and aggregation behavior.
               The ability to measure  such significant differences is important, because the
               research emphasizes observations of metabolism, using a  novel application of
              bioacoustic technology.  This project  will explore a new application of the
              acoustic Doppler  current profiler (ADCP), using measurements of Doppler 
              spectral broadening to quantify locomotory activities of  these euphasiids in
              situ.  The relationship between  locomotion and respiratory metabolism, which
              is well  established for other euphasiid species, will be measured  for the
              three species in the proposed study area of  Balsfjorden, northern Norway. 
              This research will provide an  assessment of a new, non-invasive method for
              measuring the  in situ metabolic state of macrozooplankton.  The results  will
              lead to a better understanding of how locomotory  behavior, per se, influences
              patterns of patch formation,  maintenance and dissipation.  These findings will
              be  interpreted within the framework of a mew model that  describes patch
              dynamical processes in terms of statistical  mechanics.  It is expected that
              new basic knowledge will be  added to the understanding of aggregation behavior
              of the  three species of euphasiids that play a central role in  Arctic
              ecosystems.
