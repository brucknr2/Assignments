Abstract    :
              9423556  Panetta         The central theme of this research project is to
              investigate the factors which control the  positions, structures, and
              interactions of the atmosphere's subtropical and polar front jets.  Three 
              major topics will be pursued.  The first is to examine the factors determining
              the meridional  extent of the Hadley circulation.  The second is to investigate
              whether the degree of separation  between the two jets is related to the
              frequency of blocking formations in the large-scale flow.   Finally, the
              principal investigator will explore the generation of vortices through
              wave-breaking  on tropical jets.         The principal tools are idealized, dry
              hydrodynamic models which differ in physical  extent and dynamical regime,
              depending on the aspect of flow organization being studied.  These  include
              several versions of the NCAR Community Climate Model and quasi-geostrophic
              beta-  plane models.    ***
