Abstract    :
              9423685  LETZRING     This project will support shipboard scientific support
              equipment  for the research vessel GYRE operated by Texas A & M University  
              and dedicated to use in support of ocean science research.        The Shipboard
              Scientific Support Equipment Program provides funds  for ship equipment deemed
              essential to the proper and safe     conduct of ocean science research. This
              Program provides support  for such items as deck equipment including winch
              systems for the  deployment and retrieval of scientific instruments,
              navigational  equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and earth satellite    
              receivers to pin point the location of research sites,     communication
              equipment including radio transceivers and     satellite transceivers for voice
              and scientific data     communications and other equipment such as motorized
              workboats    for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval sites.     
                  The Project Director, Dean E. Letzring is fully qualified to     direct
              this project having had considerable experience in     overseeing the
              acquisition and installation of shipboard     equipment.          This project
              will allow the institution to replace an obsolete line  scan recorder and
              obtain a NAVTEX and a weatherfax.  ***
