Abstract    :
              9423564  Weiss  The Eighteenth Fungal Genetics Conference, is being held at the
              Asilomar Conference Center at Asilomar, California on March 21-26, 1995. 
              Approximately 500 scientists and students from around the world will attend. 
              The conference is focused on the molecular biology, genetics, biochemistry and
              cell biology of filamentous fungi.  The meeting consists of six plenary
              sessions, three poster sessions, informal discussions, and a day devoted to
              concurrent workshops in specialized areas.  Topics covered are signal
              transduction, gene expression and genome structure, sexual and asexual
              reproduction, cell biology and morphogenesis, and plant and animal fungal
              pathogenesis.  Strong emphasis is placed on the participation of scientists and
              students from underrepresented groups.  %%%  Fungal genetics is important to a
              number of areas of biotechnology, such as bioremediation and plant pathology. 
              The semiannual Fungal Genetics Conference provides a means for scientists
              studying a number of different fungi to exchange ideas and information.  For
              example, there has been an extraordinary increase in sophistication of the
              research approaches used by plant pathologists due, in part, to their exchanges
              with the basic research community at these conferences.  ***
