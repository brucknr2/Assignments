Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the development of  the ionic chemistry of  
              cobaloxime pi-cations.  Tandem sequences of cobaloxime-mediated ionic and  
              cobaloxime-mediated radical reactions will afford methodology for the  
              enantiospecific formation of carbon-oxygen, carbon-nitrogen and   carbon-carbon
              bonds.  The reaction chemistry will be used to develop new   strategies for the
              synthesis of polyether antibiotics and D-aminosugars.    The chemistry outlined
              is carried out in aqueous or biodegradable alcohol   solvents with the
              production of metal residues that can be sequestered.    Thus, the chemistry
              described will have an impact on the development of   environmentally benign
              synthetic  methodology.  With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is
              supporting the research   of Dr. Bruce P. Branchaud of the Department of
              Chemistry at the   University of Oregon.  Professor Branchaud will focus his
              work on the   development of environmentally benign synthetic methodology based
              on   organocobalt chemistry.  New strategies for the preparation of  organic  
              compounds possessing interesting biological properties will be developed.
