Abstract    :
                9423958  Jacobsmeyer         This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II
              project investigates the performance and feasibility of an adaptive data rate
              modem for wireless packet radio networks.  In the United States a consortium of
              cellular service providers is building a nationwide mobile data network called
              Cellular Digital Packet Data (CDPD).  By using existing 30 kHz radio frequency
              channels, CDPD provides a mobile data overlay on the existing cellular voice
              system.  To combat the effects of multipath fading, CDPD uses a (63,47)
              Reed-Solomon code over GF(64).  This code cannot correct all the errors that
              occur during the long, deep fades that occur on the mobile radio channel.  A
              new technique, proposed herein, adapts the information data rate to the
              time-varying signal to noise ratio.  Past research has shown that in theory,
              this technique can improve throughput of CDPD by a factor of five.  The
              research objectives of this project are to construct a hardware prototype modem
              and demonstrate a factor of four improvement in throughput in Rayleigh fading. 
              The prototype will be based on the AT&T DSP32C floating point signal processor
              and will be tested using an HP11759C Fading Channel Simulator.       The
              principal commercial applications of this research are wireless multiple access
              communication networks, including cellular radio, mobile satellite and wireless
              local area networks.  The primary benefit of the proposed research is more
              economical use of cellular radio base stations and mobile terminals, resulting
              in more affordable mobile data service for the US consumer.
