Abstract    :
              Professor Michael B. Hall at the Department of Chemistry, Texas A&M   University
              is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational   Chemistry
              Program at NSF for ab initio theoretical studies of problems of   current
              interest in inorganic and organometallic chemistry, especially   homogeneous
              catalysis. The computational methods which are being used   involve
              full-gradient geometry optimization techniques for both   multiconfiguration
              self-consistent-field and configuration interaction   wavefunctions. The
              applications being made often require calculations at   the frontier of those
              possible and, if necessary, the existing methods   are modified and enhanced so
              that these calculations can be performed.   The work under this grant is
              focused on the study and the   characterization of four fundamental steps in
              catalytic reactions:   oxidative-addition; substitution; migratory-insertion;
              and atom transfer.   The systems being studied include models for biologically
              and   industrially important catalytic oxidation processes.  The work supported
              by this grant will help to provide the understanding   which will allow
              researchers to make qualitative chemical predictions,   without the need for
              further calculations, related to reactions involved   in biological and
              industrial processes. A major objective is the   discovery and prediction of
              systematic trends in the structures and   reactivity of inorganic and
              organometallic systems. In order to achieve   these objectives the systems
              being studied theoretically by Professor   Hall are chosen to be as close as
              possible to systems being studied by   experimentalists.
