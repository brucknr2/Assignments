Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry   Division,
              Professor Kenneth C. Janda of the Department of Chemistry of   the University
              of California at Irvine will pursue a series of   investigations on the
              spectroscopy and dynamics of rare gas- halogen van   der Waals compounds. 
              Among these are the HeBr2 and NeBr2 systems.  Not   only are their structures
              to be investigated, but especially the   potential energies of their weak
              interactions are to be determined.    Spectroscopy at the highest possible
              resolution will be employed to   obtain experimental data on the electronic
              states of Br2, and on HeBr2 ,   NeBr2 and ArBr2.  Intramolecular vibrational
              energy redistribution   dynamics in ArBr2 will be investigated.  This work will
              be extended to   complexes in which Br2 is imbedded in large He and Ne
              clusters.  This research is of great importance for the understanding the  
              interaction involving large halogen-containing molecular clusters.  It  
              provides  bench mark data for the development of models for the   structures
              and dynamics of weakly bonded molecular complexes.
