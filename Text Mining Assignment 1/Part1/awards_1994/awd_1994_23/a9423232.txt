Abstract    :
              This award in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program of the  Chemistry
              Division provides partial support for the 1995 Gordon  Research Conference on
              Electrochemistry.  This conference, which  brings together leading
              electrochemists world-wide, will address  the role of basic electrochemical
              sciences in various aspects of  environmental chemistry including remediation,
              mitigation and  prevention.  Through this grant, support is provided to enable
              ten  young faculty, postdoctorals, and graduate students, who might not 
              otherwise be able to participate in this conference, to present  their research
              results at this meeting and engage in interactive  dialogue with leading senior
              colleagues in the field.  Broader  applications of electrochemical techniques
              to environmental  problems could result in important advances in this
              strategically  important area.
