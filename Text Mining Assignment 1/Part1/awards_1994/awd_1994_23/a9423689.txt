Abstract    :
              9423689  Zucker    Professor Zucker will study locally symmetric spaces via
              methods  of algebraic geometry. In particular he wants to study the 
              relationship between various Hodge structures and cohomology of a  locally
              symmetric variety. He will also study extensions of  intersection cohomology to
              a class of real analytic varieties  with a view to proving a version of the
              decomposition theorem.    This is research in the field of algebraic geometry.
              Algebraic  geometry is one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but  one
              which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-  century. In its
              origin, it treated figures that could be defined  in the plane by the simplest
              equations, namely polynomials.  Nowadays the field makes use of methods not
              only from algebra,  but from analysis and topology, and conversely is finding 
              application in those fields as well as in physics, theoretical  computer
              science, and robotics.  ***
