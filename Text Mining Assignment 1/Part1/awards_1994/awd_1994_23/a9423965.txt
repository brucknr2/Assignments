Abstract    :
              CTS-9423965  G. Stephanopoulos  CACHE Corporation  ABSTRACT    This project is
              to support travel for eight new faculty and eight graduate students to attend a
              conference entitled "Intelligent Systems in Process Engineering" to be held in
              Snowmass Colorado.  This is an international conference which has individual as
              well as institutional representation from both Europe and the Far East.  There
              is also a balance between industry and academia.  The conference has nine
              identified themes, all of which impact on the usefulness of processing systems.
               The topics include:  knowledge-based product and process design, knowledge and
              CAD in engineering Design and intelligent control as well as topics relating to
              industrial applications.
