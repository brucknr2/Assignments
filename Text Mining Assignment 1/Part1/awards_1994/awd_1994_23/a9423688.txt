Abstract    :
              9423688  Kareem  The award is to support the travel of a United States team  of
              researchers and experts to attend the Ninth International  Conference on Wind
              Engineering which takes place every four  years.  The conference will be held
              in New Delhi, India, on  January 9-13, 1995.   The United States attendees will
               present papers and chair sessions.   The exchange of  information among the
              participants and their exposure to the  up-to-date scientific and engineering
              knowledge about  extreme wind hazards, especially in the area of mitigation, 
              will be of great benefit to the research community.  The  wind Engineering
              Research Council, under the direction of  the P.I., will have the
              responsibility of making available  travel funds to participants presenting
              papers and chairing  sessions.  ***
