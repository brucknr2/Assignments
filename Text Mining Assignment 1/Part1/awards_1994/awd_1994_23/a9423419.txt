Abstract    :
              Abstract  This award supports a geophysical survey from a nuclear submarine
              during operation SCICEX-95 cruise to  the Arctic Ocean. The survey will result
              in a comprehensive map of bathymetry and gravity of the Chukchi  Borderland and
              portions of the Lomonosov Ridge, Makarov Basin and Mendeleev Ridge. These areas
              are  out of the normal operating range of aerogeophysics platforms and data
              from the region that are available to  western scientists are extremely sparse.
              The proposed survey is designed to test current hypotheses of the  geologic
              structure and tectonic development of the main geographic features of the
              region.  Whether the  hypotheses prove to be true or not, the data will fill a
              conspicuous gap in the geophysical data coverage in  the Arctic Ocean Basin. 
              Hence, the data collected will be valuable to determining the geologic and
              tectonic  structure of the region and, in turn, will also be useful for
              evaluating tectonic models for the development of  the region.
