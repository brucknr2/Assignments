Abstract    :
              9423307  Bruch  This research involves the structure and dynamics of  atomically
              thin layers, emphasizing physically adsorbed  gases and adsorbed alkalis on
              metal substrates.  The  objective is to achieve a quantitative understanding of
               observed structures and dynamics of nonuniform systems in  terms of an atomic
              scale description.  The phenomena under  investigation include:  spatially
              modulated lattices,  structural relaxation in thin films, defect structures, 
              specific heat of thin films, adsorbate-substrate potentials  and potential
              barriers, lattice liquids, diffusion in thin  films, and the dynamical
              excitations of superlattices.  %%  This research deals with the theoretical
              study of layers of  atoms, often only a single layer or a partial layer, on 
              atomically smooth surfaces.  Professor Bruch is a world  expert in developing
              the theory when the interactions  between the layers and substrate are weak, as
              occurs for the  inert gases.  Here Professor Bruch seeks to clear up some 
              cases where the experimental results are at odds with  theory.  He also plans
              to extend his studies to alkali metal  atoms attached to metal surfaces.  ***
