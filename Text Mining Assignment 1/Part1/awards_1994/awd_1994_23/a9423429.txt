Abstract    :
                      ABSTRACT  HAMMER  OPP-9423429    Well publicized genetic studies linking
              the origin of modern humans to Africa have been based largely on
              maternally-inherited mitochondrial DNA, which reveal nothing about the role of
              males in the dynamics of human migration. The overall goal of this research
              project is to use the Y chromosome (carried by males alone) as an independent
              tool to test hypotheses regarding the origin and migration patterns of modern
              human populations and the male-dedicated gene flow in selected regions of the
              world. This research is the first comprehensive effort to systematically
              examine genetic variation in the human Y chromosome. These paternally derived
              data will complement the growing wealth of linguistic and archaeological data
              in northern Eurasia and give a more complete view of the origins and migration
              patterns of humans into the New World.  ***    ??
