Abstract    :
              In this project funded by the Advanced Materials Program of the Chemistry  
              Division and the Solid State Chemistry program of the Division of   Materials
              Research, Hollingsworth will design organic solids with   specified structure,
              reactivity, and physical properties.  The energetics   of organic functional
              group interactions in the solid state will be   developed by studying guest
              species in channel inclusion compounds.  The   interaction energies obtained
              will be useful in materials chemistry for   facilitating supramolecular design
              and synthesis of new organic   materials.  The ultimate goal is to synthesize
              organic molecular crystals   with the same degree of stereocontrol that is now
              commonly achieved in   single molecule organic synthesis.    %%%  This research
              program represents a rational and holistic approach to   understanding
              intermolecular forces in organic solids and is expected to   greatly facilitate
              the design and development of new organic materials.    Among the likely
              applications of this proposed research is the   fabrication of devices with
              nonlinear optical properties useful in   laser-based systems, such as
              communications.
