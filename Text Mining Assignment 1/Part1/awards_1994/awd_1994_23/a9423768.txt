Abstract    :
              This award provides funding to purchase shipboard instrumentation in support of
              NSF-funded research.  The instruments will be used aboard the R/V KNORR, a 279
              foot vessel owned by the Navy, the R/V OCEANUS, a 177 foot vessel owned by NSF,
              or the R/V ATLANTIS II, a 210 foot vessel owned by WHOI.  All of these vessels
              are operated by the Institution in support of oceanographic research, and NSF
              is the primary user of each ship.  Instrumentation funded includes a variety of
              computer hardware, a thermometer and temperature standard for the temperature
              calibration facility, a wire-lowered ADCP, a clean wire system, a portable
              fiber optic winch, a magnetometer, Niskin bottles, and CTD sensors.  The
              instrumentation requested is required for support of NSF-funded cruises aboard
              the ships during 1995 and will enhance the scientific capability of the vessels
              in the future.    ??
