Abstract    :
              Professor Donald Truhlar is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and  
              Computational Chemistry to continue his research in theoretical and  
              computational chemical dynamics and energetics.  He will continue his  
              research in the following areas: 1) Development of improved methodologies   for
              treating quantum reactive scattering; 2) Continued work on   diatom-diatom
              systems including HF-HF and H2-H2 systems; 3) Work on   solvation models for
              nonaqueous solvents, and their application to   variational transition state
              treatments of reactions in solution; 4)   Dynamics of reactions at metallic
              surfaces; and 5) Development of new   techniques and parallel Monte Carlo path
              integral algorithms for   treatment of vibrational energies, vibrational
              partition functions and   free energies.  Truhlar's research is aimed at a
              basic molecular level understanding of   chemical dynamics and solvation.  This
              research has important strategic   implications in areas of atmospheric and
              environmental chemistry
