Abstract    :
              9423636  Chapman and Bailey       Morphological and anatomical characters have
              traditionally  formed the basis for the taxonomy of the coralline red algae and
               have resulted in numerous difficulties at all levels of  classification from
              species to order.  Evolutionary convergence in  structure and environmental
              effects on shape and form are the  suspected culprits.  Mr. Jeffrey Bailey
              under the guidance of  faculty adviser Dr. Russell Chapman at Louisiana State
              University  is generating an independent molecular data set to test the array
              of  conflicting hypotheses of relationships among ca. 40 genera of  coralline
              red algae.  An associated study includes the first  analysis of a unique type
              of host-parasite association,  adelphoparasitism, found in the coralline red
              algae (although known  in other Rhodophyta).        New molecular data, nuclear
              ribosomal DNA sequences, will be  integrated with traditional morphological
              characters in a focused  study of species and genus relationships among the
              coralline red  algae.
