Abstract    :
              This award is for support for a two year study to deternine  the surface area
              and effect on energy balance of lakes on  the Greenland Ice Sheet.  The
              objectives of the work are to  determine the concentration of lakes, snow, and
              ice on parts  of the Greenland ice sheet which experience vigorous summer 
              melting, and to incorporate these concentrations into an  energy balance
              calculation.  The concentrations of lakes,  snow, and ice will be determined by
              using satellite passive  microwave data, with a method similar to that now
              routinely  used for determining sea ice concentrations and types.  Satellite
              synthetic aperture radar and AVHRR data will serve  as auxiliary sources of
              information about the ice sheet, for  location of general areas in which lakes
              form, and for use  in determining microwave characteristics of the ground 
              surface.  The effect of lake formation on energy balance in  the lake region of
              the ice sheet will be determined by  extending and applying a surface energy
              balance model.
