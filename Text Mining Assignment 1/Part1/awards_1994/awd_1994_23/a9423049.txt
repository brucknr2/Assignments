Abstract    :
              Scott       The investigator and his colleagues organize the Third 
              International Conference On Spectral And High Order Methods  (ICOSAHOM), held
              at the University of Houston, Houston, Texas,  June 5 - 9, 1995.  The
              development of high performance computers  has made spectral and high order
              methods one of the most important  techniques in modern scientific and
              engineering computation.  Presentation of recent research concerning high order
              methods has  an increasingly important role in scientific computing. 
              Applications are being made in a variety of fields, including chip  design,
              fluid dynamics and others.  The first ICOSAHOM was held in  1989 in Italy, and
              the second ICOSAHOM was in June 1992 in  Montpelier, France.  With a long
              periodicity of 3 years, ICOSAHOM  plays the role of an "international congress"
              for the subject and  provides an opportunity to coordinate and stimulate
              research in  spectral and high order methods.       This conference focuses on
              numerical methods for the accurate  solution of partial differential equations.
               Such equations arise  in simulating manufacturing processes and designing new
              products,  from automobiles and airplanes to computer chips.  Highly accurate 
              solutions are needed because current design and processes have  reached a
              refined state that requires extremely accurate and  efficient simulations to
              remain competitive.  This need has driven  the development and use of
              high-performance computers themselves,  as well as of specific algorithms for
              them.  The aim of this  conference is to bring together leading researchers,
              both  established and younger scientists, in this increasingly active  and
              highly interdisciplinary field to survey and review the  current state of
              research.
