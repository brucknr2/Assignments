Abstract    :
                    This award supports summer research by undergraduates in the 
              research/conservation branch of the San Diego Zoo.  Students  pursue research
              related to ongoing faculty research programs  concerned with behavior,
              comparative and reproductive  physiology, endocrinology, genetics and other
              aspects of the  biology of endangered species.  Students also participate in  a
              biweekly seminar during the 12-week program.
