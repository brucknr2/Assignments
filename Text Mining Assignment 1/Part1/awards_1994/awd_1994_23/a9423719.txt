Abstract    :
              9423719  Kuhn       Homotopy theory and representation theory have quite
              distinct  origins, with the former being motivated by the desire to  understand
              the global structure of geometric objects such as  manifolds, and the latter
              evolving out of the study of how  algebraic structures act as symmetries on
              vector spaces.  Professor  Kuhn is continuing his study of the common ground
              between these  subjects, as typified by his development of "generic
              representation  theory," which was originally inspired by work by topologists
              on  the Steenrod algebra, but which seems to offer new powerful tools  for
              understanding completely representation theoretic topics such  as the modular
              representations of the finite general linear groups  and the MacLane homology
              of algebraic K-theorists.  Among the  specific questions being studied are ones
              dealing with homotopy "at  a large prime," topological realization questions,
              and the relation  between stable K-theory and MacLane homology.       Both
              homotopy theory and representation theory are  mathematical subjects in which
              one is trying to discover, and  ultimately classify, fundamental "building
              blocks" of structure:  homotopy dealing with deformations of geometric objects
              such as  higher dimensional surfaces, and representation theory being 
              concerned with symmetries of discrete algebraic objects such as  configurations
              of lines and planes.  Professor Kuhn is continuing  his study of some of the
              common ground between these, using  algebraic tools developed by him that were
              inspired by homotopy  theoretic experiences.  ***
