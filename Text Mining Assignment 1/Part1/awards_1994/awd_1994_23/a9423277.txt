Abstract    :
              This planning grant will focus and refine theory and methodology for field
              research on collaborative processes in long-term interdisciplinary and
              inter-institutional projects organized to solve complex social and
              technological problems.  Two projects, one on adolescent social welfare issues
              and one on issues of regional water management, have agreed to serve as primary
              case studies; five others will be involved in pre-testing.  In this phase of
              the research, the investigators will 1. consolidate and evaluate theories that
              address collaborations, anchoring the project in Vygotskian sociocultural
              theory; 2. develop hypotheses about collaborator values, roles, and working
              methods; the interaction of these variables in multifaceted projects, and the
              effects of these interactions on project climate, productivity, and
              effectiveness; 3. determine levels of analysis; 4. identify social and
              political issues affecting the primary case studies; 5. design a case study
              approach balancing generalizability and depth; 6. refine and pre-test methods;
              and 7. interview three key participants in each primary case.  During this
              phase, the investigators will present their results at regional and national
              conferences.  At its end, they will prepare and submit a research proposal to
              implement the design that they have developed.
