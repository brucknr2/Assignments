Abstract    :
              9423289  Nelson       The possibility that atomic chlorine concentrations in the
               marine surface layer are large enough to compete with hydroxyl  radical (OH)
              as the major tropospheric oxidizer continues to  receive considerable
              speculation.  Chlorine atoms participate in  the oxidation of hydrocarbons,
              dimethyl sulfide, and can also  directly influence tropospheric ozone loss
              through catalytic  cycles with chlorine monoxide (ClO) and hydroperoxy (HO2) 
              radicals.  The net effect on the ozone budget may be highly  dependent on the
              partitioning of the inorganic chlorine pool  between four chlorine-containing
              gases; hydrogen chloride (HCl),  hypochlorous acid (HOCl), molecular chlorine
              (Cl2), and chlorine  nitrate (ClONO2).  To assess the potential importance of
              chlorine  chemistry in the lower atmosphere, direct measurements of these 
              species are necessary.  In Phase I of this research, the  feasibility of
              detecting both HCl and HOCl down to the 10 to 20  part-per-trillion (pptv)
              concentration range by tunable diode  infrared laser absorption was
              demonstrated.       The Phase II research effort will improve the basic 
              spectroscopic parameters for quantifying HOCl concentrations in  the
              atmosphere, and develop and construct a prototype field  instrument capable of
              simultaneous measurements of HCl and HOCl  in the marine troposphere.  This new
              instrument will be  laboratory tested and evaluated against existing, albeit 
              nonselective, inorganic chlorine techniques in an  intercomparison.       The
              instrumentation produced as a result of this research  program will be useful
              for measuring other trace gases in  addition to HCl and HOCl.  The novel long
              path, multiple pass  absorption cell developed during this project will have 
              independent commercialization potential for other laser  absorption systems
              used to monitor industrial pollutants, toxic  wastes, and various gases emitted
              from combustion processes.
