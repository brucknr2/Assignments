Abstract    :
                   This is the first year funding of a three-year continuing  grant.  Research
              in distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) is  concerned with how automated
              agents can be designed to interact  effectively.  This proposal involves the
              use of a strategic-  negotiation model to achieve inter-agent cooperation. 
              During the  strategic-negotiations agents communicate their respective desires 
              and compromise to reach mutually beneficial agreement.  Strategic-  negotiation
              is a process that may include several iterations of  offers and counter offers.
               A major consideration in this domain  has been to reduce overhead costs
              resulting from planning and  negotiation time.  This research examines resource
              allocation and  task distribution problems among autonomous agents.  The
              objective  is the development of an automated agent capable of efficient 
              cooperation with other agents in its environment.
