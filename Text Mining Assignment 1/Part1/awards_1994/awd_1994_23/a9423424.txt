Abstract    :
              9423424  VESSEY   A central question in ecology is:  what factors affect
              population size?  Most previous models incorporated only density-dependent
              factors because density-independent factors are difficult to analyze
              statistically and manipulate experimentally.  However, because real
              environments vary, population models should include stochastic environmental
              factors to describe population dynamics accurately.  The objectives of this
              study are to explain and predict population fluctuations based on stochastic
              environmental conditions, using statistical techniques previously unused in an
              ecological context.   The effect of weather on Peromyscus densities in one- and
              two-species communities will be modeled using data sets of twenty and fifteen
              years, respectively.  Population densities will be forecasted, and simulations
              will determine the effect of different weather regimes on densities.  Inclusion
              of stochastic weather in population models will lead to better explanation and
              forecasting of population fluctuations.
