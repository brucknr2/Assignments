Abstract    :
              This project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, is 
              directed towards the development of enzyme immunoassay type sensors for the
              selective  quantification of biomacromolecules.  During the tenure of this 
              three-year standard grant, Professor Meyerhoff and his students at the
              University of Michigan  will investigate the fundamentals of operation of
              thioctic acid self-assembled monolayer bound  enzyme-antibody electrodes
              capable of assaying protein antigens in untreated whole blood.   Novel sensors
              are introduced having the capability of assaying human chorionic gonadotropin 
              (hCG) and prostate specific antigen (PSA) at the part-per-trillion level in
              undiluted whole blood.   Future efforts will be geared towards the
              miniaturization of sensor devices which are capable  of automated,
              multi-component analyses of protein analyte over a wide dynamic concentration 
              range.  In addition, Professor Meyerhoff is also continuing his efforts in
              developing enzyme-  linked binding assays (ELBAs) whereby the complexation and
              binding sites of charged biological  macromolecules that interact specifically
              with glycosaminoglycans can be characterized.  The  latter techniques are used
              in the assessment of carbohydrate structure and content of intact 
              glycoproteins.    Few analytical probes can rival the sensitivity and
              selectivity for biological macromolecules as  exhibited by enzyme-antibody type
              sensors.  These devices are capable of sub-part-per-trillion  detection of
              protein analyte present in complex matrices such as whole blood and waste
              water.   Professor Meyerhoff and his students at the University of Michigan are
              advancing new  generations of these devices which are capable of assaying
              mixtures of protein analytes over  wide concentration ranges with minimal
              sample pretreatment.  This analytical technology will  be broadly applicable to
              biotechnology, clinical chemistry, and pharmaceutical research and 
              manufacture.
