Abstract    :
              9423645  Rajan         There is very little scientific evidence on how the 
              different financial systems of foreign countries affect the  financing choices
              of firms, and even less evidence on how these  choices affect industrial
              competitiveness.  This project attempts  to shed some light on how firms obtain
              financing in other systems  in order to improve our understanding of the
              effects of financial  choices on industrial competitiveness.          The first
              part of the project establishes the broad stylized  facts on financing and
              dividend decisions in a sample of large  industrialized countries characterized
              by different institutional  environments.  More specifically, the project
              explores the level  and the determinants of corporate leverage across
              countries, both  at the aggregate and firm specific level; analyzes the 
              determinants of the maturity structure of debt across countries;  analyzes the
              dividend policy in different countries; and studies  the determinants of
              inter-firm trade credit and how it varies  across the business cycle.  The
              second part of the project tests  different theories of corporate financing
              decision.  Myers'  Pecking Order Theory and Jensen's Free Cash Flow Theory are 
              tested using the dynamic aspects of financing choices.  A  theoretical
              framework is developed to identify demand and supply  of debt versus equity and
              used to analyze separately the effects  of different financial institutions and
              regulation on the supply  of, and the demand for, different financing
              instruments.   Finally, this project analyzes the social costs and benefits 
              under different bankruptcy codes and institutional settings by  studying the
              response of firms to financial distress in different  countries.
