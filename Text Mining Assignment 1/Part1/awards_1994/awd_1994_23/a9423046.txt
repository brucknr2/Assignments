                                        ABSTRACT                                              
                                 The  primary  objectives  of  this  workshop  are  to:   (a)
               determine the nature and extent of bridge research currently  in  progress
              throughout North America by federal, state, and  local   transportation  
              agencies,  universities,   research  institutions,  and other organizations;
              (b) determine  which  agencies  are  funding bridge research  and  identify 
              their  current  needs and long-term goals; (c) provide a forum  for 
              information sharing among and between researchers,  research  funding 
              agencies, and bridge designers and owners; and  (d)  produce  a  report that
              summarizes current  bridge  research  activities  for  dissemination to  bridge
               research  program  directors    university   and   institutional  
              researchers,  educators, bridge owners and consulting engineers, and state  and
               federal  agencies interested in bridge  research.   The  workshop  will 
              identify  international  bridge  engineering  research of note and importance
              of North American practice.
