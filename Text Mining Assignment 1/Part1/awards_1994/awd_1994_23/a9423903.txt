Abstract    :
              9423903  The Worcester Foundation Summer Training Program is a ten  week
              immersion in biological research for undergraduate  students.  It consists of
              intensive "hands-on" laboratory  research experience individualized for each
              student and  performed under the guidance of working scientists expert in  many
              of the modern areas of biological science.  The Program  is designed to provide
              students with their first exposure to  the actual practical of scientific
              research in the hopes  that the excitement, challenge and creativity of the 
              enterprise will convince them to consider basic research in  the sciences as a
              viable career choice.  In the spring, each  student is matched with a basic
              research project, initially  proposed by a preceptor with an active research
              program in  the students stated area mf interest.  Upon acceptance, each 
              student is provided with a reading list of current  publications in the
              selected area to provide the background  required for the proposed summer
              research project .  During  the Program we: 1) instruct each student in safe
              laboratory,  and appropriate ethical practice; 2) acquaint them with  current
              issues in biology: 3) teach them scientific  techniques and skills, many of
              which can be utilized in  their future endeavors; 4) guide them in shaping the 
              specific research questions to be asked; 5) require that  they work
              independently toward the agreed upon research  goals; 6) encourage cross
              disciplinary approaches by  providing opportunities for interaction with other
              students,  our research staff, and our visiting scientists; and 7)  maintain an
              educational setting which is maximally  challenging and thus, fosters each
              student's exploration of  future  career choices in science.  In addition to
              the  required written report detailing the progress made in their  individual
              research projects, each student presents a short  oral report to the Faculty
              and public summarizing the  results of their efforts at a closing
              mini-symposium and  award ceremony.
