Abstract    :
              9423416  Pierce    Censuses of three separate populations in Amazonian Peru show
              striking association between the reproductive biology of the ant-plant, Cordia
              nodosa (Boraginaceae), and the species of ant inhabiting it.  Cordia nodosa
              rarely produces flowers and fruits when inhabited by the most common symbiotic
              ant species, Allomerus demerarae, but regularly flowers and fruits when
              inhabited by three, rarer symbiotic ant species (Azteca spp., Myrmelachista
              sp.).  Interestingly, there is no detectable difference in the rate of
              vegetative growth.  These results indicate that Allomerus may be a parasite of
              C. nodosa.  Moreover, colonization experiments show that parasitoid wasp
              predation on Azteca foundresses may in part mediate the coexistence of multiple
              ant species on the single resource represented by C. nodosa.  These complex
              interactions make the C. nodosa-ant assemblage an ideal system in which to
              investigate factors shaping the evolution of mutualisms.     This research will
              assess the relative costs and benefits provided by different ant associates to
              the plant, and will investigate the dynamics of colonization by C. nodosa. 
              This research will address two important areas in community ecology:  the role
              that parasitisms have in the evolution and ecology of mutualisms and the role
              that natural enemies have in maintaining species diversity.  In doing so, this
              research will enhance understanding of mutualistic interactions and their role
              in ecological communities.
