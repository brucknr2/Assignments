Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry  
              Program will continue support to Dr. Richard H. Holm of the Chemistry  
              Department, Harvard University, for research in the area of bioinorganic  
              chemistry.  Three systems will be investigated: oxygen atom transfer  
              chemistry of molybdenum and tungsten dithiolenes, which is related to the  
              behavior of molybdenum enzymes; hydrogen evolution from reduced nickel   and
              formation of thioesters from nickel-acyls and thiols, which are   studies
              relevant to the behavior of hydrogenase and carbon monoxide   dehydrogenase;
              and binuclear iron-copper bridged molecular assemblies   related to the
              binuclear sites of heme-copper oxidases.  Kinetics and   other aspects of these
              processes will be examined to provide descriptions   of reaction pathways that
              may be feasible in enzymatic reactions.  In   addition, low-temperature
              syntheses of metal clusters containing   chalcogenides or chalcohalides will be
              developed.    Enzymatic reactions provide rapid low-energy routes to reactions 
               important not only in biological systems, but also in synthesis of   important
              organic and inorganic chemicals.  By investigating the detailed   mechanism of
              fundamental reactions involving oxygen atom transfer,   oxidation-reduction,
              and hydrogen transfer, Dr. Holm may elucidate   spatial and steric requirements
              useful for the development of new   synthetic routes, as well as increase
              understanding of biological action
