Abstract    :
              9423936  Cunningham  A new REU Site will be initiated in Physics at Bucknell 
              University.  This grant will support eight undergraduate  students, including
              equipment and supplies, for ten weeks each  summer for three consecutive
              summers.  Students will be able to  select from a variety of projects which
              reflect the varied  research interests of the faculty in our department. These 
              projects, both in theory and experimental work, encompass a broad  range of
              fields including biophysics, gravitational theory and  black holes, cometary
              astrophysics, positron physics, non-linear  optics, laser spectroscopy, and
              nonlinear dynamics.    A responsible recruiting campaign is planned to seek
              students in  the Eastern seaboard and Appalachian regions of the country and 
              with specific effort at targeting institutions which historically  draw
              students who are underrepresented in the physical sciences.  ***
