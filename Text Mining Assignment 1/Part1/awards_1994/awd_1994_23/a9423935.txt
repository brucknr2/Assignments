Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, Mark Berg   of
              the University of South Carolina will study the interactions   responsible for
              solvent induced processes observed in solution phase   chemistry.  The
              polarized transient holeburning technique will be used to   study solvent
              interactions with electronic states, and coherent Raman   spectroscopies will
              be used to determine solvent interactions with   vibrational states.  Studies
              will be conducted as a function of    temperature to span the region from solid
              to liquid phase across the   glass transition to distinguish between
              phonon-induced and structural   solvation dynamics.  Systems to be studied
              include anthracenes and   tetrazines in a set of quasi-spherical solvent
              molecules.  The theory   necessary to explain and interpret the experimental
              results will also be   developed or expanded.    Much of chemistry takes place
              in the liquid phase.  However, because of   the interactions between solvent
              molecules, it is often difficult to   determine the processes responsible for
              chemical reactions.  Professor   Berg will apply sophisticated laser techniques
              to differentiate various   forms of these interactions and their effects on the
              internal states of   molecules.  Such studies will be of value in the design of
              new optical   materials.
