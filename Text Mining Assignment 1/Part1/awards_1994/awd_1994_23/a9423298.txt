Abstract    :
              9423298  Nasar       The global and overall objective of the proposed research
              is  to launch and establish a research program in short-stroke linear 
              reciprocating machines operating as generators and motors.  These  machines may
              be field-excited or may have permanent magnets (PMs)  for field production, or
              may be reluctance type synchronous  machines.  Numerous topologies are feasible
              for such machines.   The proposed phase of study will focus on permanent-magnet
              short-  stroke linear-motion reciprocating synchronous machines operating  as
              generators and motors.  ***
