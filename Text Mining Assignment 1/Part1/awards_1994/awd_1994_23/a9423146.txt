Abstract    :
                  9423146  DOUGLAS   Large-scale geographic changes have occurred in western
              North America as a result of geologic upheaval and climate.  These have
              spatially isolated western fishes to produce patterns of geographic variation
              within and between lineages.  Congruence between pattern and process will be
              tested by using as a model organism a morphologically variable, widespread,
              western minnow (Rhinichthys osculus).  Forty-five populations (50 individuals
              each) will be sampled from 10 different river systems (which form five
              different basins, each with known geological histories).  Four other species
              will be used as comparisons for analyses.  Seven individuals per population
              will be evaluated for genetic diversity by evaluating the DNA of their
              respective cellular mitochondria.  Data will be evaluated using  (a)
              traditional population genetic and geographic variation techniques, and  (b)
              newer techniques which evaluate ancestor-descendant relationships among
              populations.   Results from this study will provide a generalized model of
              geographic affinity between populations of a widely distributed fish species in
              western North America.  This model can then be evaluated for congruence with
              other widespread (but less easily sampled) species of western fishes.
