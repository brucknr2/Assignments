Abstract    :
              This award supports summer research in field biology by  undergraduates at the
              Mt. Lake Biological Station of the  University of Virginia.  During the 10-week
              program,  students pursue a research problem with the guidance of a  faculty
              mentor; mentors are chosen from among researchers  who come to the station for
              summer field work.  Many of the  mentors come from institutions other than the
              University of  Virginia.  Besides their research projects, students 
              participate in several informal and formal seminars each  week.
