Abstract    :
              CTS-9423090  Charles Martin  CO State Univ.    Novel molecular - recognition
              membranes will be developed for use in separations.  The composite membranes
              consist of an ultrathin film (less than 100 nm thick) of a chemical selective
              polymer deposited onto the surface of a microporous supported membrane.  The
              selective film will be composed of a molecularly-imprinted polymer (MIP).  MIPs
              are prepared via template polymerization that yields sites which selectively
              bind the print molecule.  Ultrathin MIP films that are nanoporous rather than
              macroporous will be synthesized.  The effects of synthesis conditions on the
              selectivity and rate of transport of the print solute will be determined.  The
              research may lead to the development of nanofiltration membranes with high
              transport selectivity.  The proposed membranes have potential applications in
              biochemical and petrochemical separations as well as sensor technology.
