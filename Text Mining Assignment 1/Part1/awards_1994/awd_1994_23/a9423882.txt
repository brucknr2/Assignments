Abstract    :
              This proposal calls for the study of the physical mechanisms  responsible for
              the spatio-temporal dynamics of the beam  patterns in a self-pumped BaTio3
              phase conjugator using beam  fanning and internal total reflection (a "cat"
              phase  conjugator).  The study will involve systematic measurements  of
              nonlinear dynamical behaviors of the cat phase  conjugator.  Theoretical models
              will be established and  numerical simulations will be carried out based on 
              experimental results.
