Abstract    :
              9423541  Rodgers      A workshop will be held in early 1995 to discuss the new- 
              term Future of Scientific Scholarly Publishing and  Information Dissemination. 
                   The purpose of this workshop is to aggregate the  outcomes of a number of
              recent planned meetings and  workshops, to develop a big-picture view, to share
               information on the status of initiatives planned or  underway, and to produce
              a document that describes the  capabilities needed by a WWW/Mosaic system that
              can serve as  a general-purpose delivery system for scientific  information.   
                 Participants will be invited from the scientific  scholarly publishing,
              library, and vendors communities.  In  addition, there will be provision for a
              small number of  other observers.
