Abstract    :
              DMS-9423945  Kalka         This REU site award provides support for three
              undergraduate  researchers in mathematics. Research will be in an area of 
              geometry or topology. The program will run for eight weeks.  Students will
              participate in a seminar series and will each give  a presentation. In
              addition, a visitor will be brought in from  outside this university to
              interact with the students.
