Abstract    :
              9423757  Markow  The purpose of this small grant for exploratory research is to
              attempt to restore an extremely valuable blood DNA data base from a population
              of the Havasupai tribe in northern Arizona. Since 1980, the PI and
              collaborators had sampled blood for DNA from every living member of the tribe.
              This has provided a genealogy and genetic history that extends back to the late
              1800's. The blood samples were accidentally mismanaged and the PI proposes to
              use PCR techniques to restore the supply of remaining DNA.  %%%  This project
              meets two of the criteria for exploratory grants, it is high risk and urgent.
              This blood DNA data base is unique and invaluable because of its extent and
              completeness. All attempts to restore the data base should be explored.
