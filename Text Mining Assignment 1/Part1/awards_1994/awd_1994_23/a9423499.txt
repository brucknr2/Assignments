Abstract    :
              9423499  Malek    Description:  This is a planning visit award to  allow Dr.
              R.I. Malek of the Pennsylvania State  University's Materials Research
              laboratory to  interact with Dr. H. Ghorab at Helwan  University and Dr. A.
              Abdelalim at Zagazig  University in Egypt.  The object of the  interaction is
              the search for substitute  raw materials for cement and concrete.  The two 
              sides expect to develop a cooperative research  project with the objectives of
              utilizing  industrial by-products and wastes as partial  substitutes for
              cement, and establishing new  concrete mix designs to accommodate the new 
              materials.  ***
