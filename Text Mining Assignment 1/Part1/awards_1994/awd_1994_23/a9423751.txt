Abstract    :
              9423751  Daemen    This is the 35th U.S. Rock Mechanics Symposium, to be 
              convened at the University of Nevada, Reno on June 4-7,  1995.  The objective
              of the biennial U.S. Rock Mechanics  Symposium is to provide a forum for the
              interdisciplinary  exchange of information among rock mechanics practitioners 
              and researchers.  The interdisciplinary nature of the  interchange is
              emphasized, because rock mechanics research  is conducted in a variety of
              disciplines, e.g. civil,  mining, geological, and petroleum engineering,
              structural  geology, hydrology, and geophysics.  Given the numerous and 
              wide-ranging disciplines involved, it unquestionably can be  rather difficult
              to maintain a clear perception of ongoing  research.  The interdisciplinary
              nature of the subject makes  it particularly necessary and important for
              practitioners to  be able to meet regularly, on a formal as well as informal 
              basis.  Workshops and field trips before and after the  Symposium will provide
              opportunities for deeper pursuit of  selected topics.
