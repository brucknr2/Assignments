Abstract    :
              9423818  Turcotte    This research is to combine the mathematical expertise
              available at the International Institute of Earthquake Prediction Theory and
              Mathematical Geophysics, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, with the evolving
              physics research in this country on complexity.  The Moscow group is a world
              leader in statistical studies of seismicity.  The PI is a leader in the
              discovery of new approaches to complex physical systems, especially
              self-organized criticality as applied to regional seismicity.  Realistic models
              for regional seismicity will be developed from the wide range of available
              slider-block models that exhibit self-organized criticality.  These models can
              be used as test beds for potential statistical approaches.  Combining these two
              approaches should advance our understanding of earthquake mechanics, improve
              earthquake hazard assessment, and advance earthquake prediction techniques. 
              This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction
              Program.  ***  ??
