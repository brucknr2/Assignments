Abstract    :
                  9423446  MORAN   It is well established that a character of an organism can
              chanee in response to different environmental conditions, even though the
              underlying genetic composition of the organism is the same.  This ability to
              respond to different environmental condition is termed phenotypic plasticity. 
              Recent theoretical work suggests that phenotypic plasticity is favored by
              natural selection in variable environments as an evolutionary mechanism for
              coping with environmental variability.  As such, phenotypic plasticity may
              affect evolutionary change and biodiversity in the broad sense.   The purpose
              of this study is to test empirically the prediction made by the theoretical
              models, by comparing the levels of morphological phenotypic plasticity along
              precipitation and temperature variability gradients.  This can increase our
              understanding of the importance of phenotypic plasticity in evolutionary
              change.  In addition, this study may help conservation biologists understand
              the effects of environmental change on populations, as these are determined in
              part by their level of phenotypic plasticity.  The study species, the
              pallid-wing grasshopper (Trimerotropis pallidipennis), is considered an
              agricultural pest in outbreak years.  Knowledge of the importance of the
              environment on the genetics of this species may help us understand the
              evolution of insect outbreaks.
