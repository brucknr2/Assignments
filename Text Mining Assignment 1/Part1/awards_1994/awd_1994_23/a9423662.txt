Abstract    :
                  9423662  EANES   The dynamics of speciation in wide-ranging and widely
              dispersing organisms continues to challenge evolutionary biologists, especially
              in marine invertebrates where geographic isolation seems unlikely in many
              cases.  Recent work suggests that the molecular interaction of sperm and eggs
              may play a major role in reproductive isolation in animals that release gametes
              freely into the water.  In sea urchins in particular, a molecule (the protein
              "bindin") has been characterized that mediates species specific fertilization. 
              DNA-techniques now permit us to examine the forces that underlie the evolution
              of this reproductive barrier, and the consequences for fitness can be easily
              studied in sea urchins.   The free spawning echinoids Strongylocentrotus
              droebachiensis and S. pallidus are close relatives of a major model organism in
              cellular and developmental biology, S. purpuratus.  They co-occur throughout
              northern high latitudes and may hybridize asymmetrically.  This study will
              examine their population structure and the evolution of their bindin-molecules
              at the DNA level.  Preliminary data show geographic differentiation and
              interesting patterns of molecular evolution.  The project will also add to the
              scarce data on the population structure and dynamics of circumarctic species. 
              This is particularly important for S. droebachiensis which is being harvested
              increasingly.
