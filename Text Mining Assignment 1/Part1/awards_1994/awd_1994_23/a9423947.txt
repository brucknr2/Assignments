Abstract    :
              In recognition of the many challenges that environmental  problems pose, and the
              dire need for trained scientists and  management personnel in this field, the
              grantee will  initiate an REU Site program with an ecology /environment  theme
              via a collaborative effort between New Mexico State  University (NMSU) and
              Howard University (HU).  Their  goal  is to provide a multi-cultural group of
              students with a  rigorous research experience in ecology/environmental  biology
              during an eight-week summer period, followed by a 10  day visit to Washington,
              DC where they will be exposed to  work being done by environmental agencies. 
              At NMSU, groups  of 3 or 4 students will collaborate in data collection on an 
              original research project; each student will be responsible  for analyzing and
              presenting a unique subset of the data at  a mini-symposium.  During meetings
              with their group  mentor(s) students will discuss relevant literature, 
              problems encountered, and new hypotheses and experimental  designs for others
              to test in future years.  While at NMSU,  a series of visitors knowledgeable in
              environmental problems  specific to the southwest will speak  informally with
              the  entire group.  Discussions will encompass many topics of  particular
              interest to minority groups including  environmental justice and how cultural
              perceptions affect  interpretation of environmental  problems and
              implementation  of appropriate policies.  Next the entire group will visit  HU
              where formal lectures on environmental policy, justice  and related issues will
              be presented.  The group will also  tour governmental and non-governmental
              agencies where they  will meet representatives concerned  with environmental 
              problems.  This experience will not only make the students  more aware of how
              ecological research is used to make policy  decisions but will provide them
              with knowledge od job  opportunities in environmental biology.
