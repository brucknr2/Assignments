Abstract    :
              9423252  This is a continued investigation of the trace constituents  in arctic
              aerosols, using the Instrumental Neutron  Activation Analysis (INAA) technique.
               The technique is  extremely sensitive and powerful, capable of determining the
               concentration of about forty elements, including many  environmentally crucial
               ones such as aluminum, zinc, arsenic and antimony that are  present in very
              low concentrations.  This study will  complete the analysis of filtered samples
              obtained by the  Atmospheric Environment Services of Canada on Ellesmere 
              Island from 1980 to 1991, of samples obtained in 1992 during  the Polar Sunrise
              Experiment, and additional samples to be  obtained from Alaska, northern
              Canada, and northern Finland.    The occurrence of arctic haze, the general
              term for aerosol  concentrations in the lower troposphere, reaches a seasonal 
              maximum in late winter when it becomes widespread through  the arctic.  The
              variation is the result both of seasonal  differences in the northward
              transport, and in the removal  process through wet and dry deposition. 
              Multivariate factor  analysis, potential source contribution functions, and
              time  series analyses, combined with air mass trajectories will  provide
              advective patterns that will refine our  understanding of the transport
              mechanism and atmospheric  pathways from the source regions to the Canadian
              Arctic, and  allow the investigations of trends in the relative  composition of
              the arctic aerosol trace constituents.  ***
