Abstract    :
              This grant provides funding to purchase shipboard and shorebased instrumentation
              in support of NSF-funded research.  The shipboard instruments will be used
              aboard the R/V MOANA WAVE, a 213 foot vessel, which is owned by the Navy and
              operated by the University in support of oceanographic research. 
              Instrumentation funded includes computer hardware, repair of water bottles, a
              CTD, a thermosalinograph, a continuous seawater sampling system, a 
              fluorometer, a portable sonobuoy system, an optical scanning system, a portable
              digital scope, and shipboard meteorological sensors. The instrumentation is
              required for support of NSF-funded cruises aboard the MOANA WAVE during 1995
              and to enhance the scientific capability of the vessel in the future.  ??
