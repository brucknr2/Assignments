Abstract    :
                9423237  Hough    Transitional systems offer political elites a choice of 
              participating in newly formed institutions or participating in  the vestiges of
              the old system.  This Doctoral Dissertation  Research Support investigation
              examines the decision of  individual elites to enter electoral politics in
              transitional  systems and the strategies they pursue to secure office.  The 
              goal of the project is to obtain a clearer picture of who  participates, their
              inclination to engage in collective activity,  and the mechanisms that define
              individual commitment to  institutional structure.  The project will draw a
              link between  the strategic behavior of candidates in the campaign period and 
              their behavior within newly emerging institutions such as parties  and
              legislatures.  ***
