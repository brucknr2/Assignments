Abstract    :
              This award supports summer research by undergraduates at the  Whitney Laboratory
              of the University of Florida.  Students  pursue research related to ongoing
              faculty research programs  that study the physiology, anatomy, biochemistry and
               molecular biology of various marine invertebrates and  fishes.  Students also
              participate in weekly seminars and  informal research presentations, as well as
              discussions of  scientific ethics and lectures and field trips that expose 
              students to the ecology of nearby marine ecosystems.
