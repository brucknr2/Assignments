Abstract    :
              Professor Stephen J. Klippenstein at the Department of Chemistry, Case   Western
              Reserve University, is supported by a grant from the Theoretical   and
              Computational Chemistry Program at NSF for the development of   theoretical
              approaches and the application of these approaches to the   study of
              barrierless reactions. These reactions can be viewed as   unimolecular
              dissociation reactions for which there is no barrier to the   reverse
              recombination process. The research under this grant is focused   on three
              topics: (1) The description of the interaction energies between   the reacting
              fragments. (2) The determination of the density of states,   especially in the
              region of the transition state. And, (3) the study of   energy flow processes
              in the reaction, especially as this can be used to   evaluate statistical
              models of reaction kinetics. Detailed comparisons of   the results obtained
              from these studies are being made with experimental   results and with other
              theoretical results in order to obtain an enhanced   understanding of reaction
              dynamics.   Accurate descriptions of the kinetics of barrierless associations
              and the   reverse dissociations are of the utmost importance for the modelling
              of a   variety of gas phase chemistries including those occuring in combustion,
                atmospheric, and interstellar environments. An important objective of the  
              work supported by this grant is to improve the ability to interpret and   to
              predict properties of these barrierless reactions.
