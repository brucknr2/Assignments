Abstract    :
              9423032  Segal    This dissertation research examines the impact of Supreme
              Court  decisions on public opinion in local communities in which the  cases are
              generated.  Four decisions by the court (two civil-  liberties and two
              economic/property rights cases) will be  studied.  The two-wave panel research
              design will measure  opinions on the issue both before and after the Supreme
              Court  decision.  Each panel will consist of two geographic samples of 
              residents of the immediate town where the case originate and  residents of the
              surrounding towns.  This research will  investigate the levels of awareness of
              the case, levels of  opinion change, and citizens' evaluation of the Court
              after it  has decided the case.  This study will contribute to our 
              understanding of the impact Supreme Court rulings have on the  opinions of
              residents of the community in which the case  originates, how rulings affect
              their evaluation of the Court,  and their perception of the impact of the Court
              on their lives.    ***
