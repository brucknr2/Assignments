Abstract    :
              9423026  Moore  This project is a study of law in the New England fishing
              industry in 1995, a time of ecological stress in the ocean, social and economic
              stress on the shore, and rapid lawmaking at national, state, local, and
              international levels.  The methods of the study are ethnographic and historical
              and the site of the ethnographic work is Gloucester, Massachusetts.  The
              project aims to document and analyze beliefs and practices of social grouns in
              this highly state-regulated social field; to link legal events in the social
              field to later and longer-term social ecological processes, and to develop a
              methodology for longitudinal studies of lawmaking in highly regulated social
              fields in complex societies.  %%%%  Cod, haddock, flounder and other
              "groundfish" have been fished off the coast of New England for at least 350
              years.  Indeed it was the reports of abundant cod in coastal waters that drew
              English colonists in the 1620s to the area that became Gloucester,,
              Massachusetts.  Economically and culturally important to the region, groundfish
              species have experienced cycles of decline and recovery for at least 100 years,
              but the present decline is apparently unprecedented.  A predominant belief that
              this decline is due to overfishing has led to significant regulation of the New
              England fishing industry in an effort to restore fish stocks.  Though not new,
              the regulation efforts are extensive and intimately tied to the economic,
              ecological, and cultural contexts of the region.  This project aims to study
              lawmaking processes in this field through a combination of ethnographic and
              historical techniques.  The combination of the ethnographic and historical
              research should create a large data base that will support a longitudinal study
              of lawmaking in a highly regulated social field in a complex society, and
              contribute to comparative studies of lawmaking in such fields.  ****
