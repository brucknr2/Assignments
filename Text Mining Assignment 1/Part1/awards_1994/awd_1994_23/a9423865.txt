Abstract    :
              9423865  BLAUT  STEA     The research entails a set of discrete projects
              designed to test the hypothesis that mapping (the creation and use of
              representational models of landscape) is a ubiquitous activity by humans of all
              ages.  The projects entail archaeological, cultural, and child-developmental
              approaches, and archival, ethnographic, and experimental methodologies.  The
              team of collaborators includes researchers experienced in each of these
              approaches and methodologies.  Projects will be carried out in the US, Mexico,
              and England (the English research is not being funded through this award).  The
              studies and associated theoretical work will be only a partial test of the
              notion that mapping is a cultural universal;  positive results would suggest
              that map-making and -reading are more widespread across eras, cultures, and
              personal development stages than has generally been recognized.  The
              investigators hope that the current work will lay a foundation for further
              study of how people learn to construct and to read maps.
