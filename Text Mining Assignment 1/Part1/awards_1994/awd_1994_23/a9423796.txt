Abstract    :
              Terman       The investigator studies large networks of relaxation-type 
              oscillators with coupling that mimics chemical synapses.  These  lead to large
              systems of differential equations that include  numerous physical parameters as
              well as multiple time scales.  The  models typically display an incredibly rich
              structure of dynamic  behavior; this depends in a highly nontrivial way on the
              various  parameters.  The investigator systematically studies what sorts of 
              collective behavior are possible in a given network, determines  the
              mathematical mechanisms responsible for this rich oscillatory  behavior,
              classifies the sorts of bifurcations that can take place  as parameters in the
              models are varied, and determines the  physical consequences of the underlying
              mathematical structures.       The types of networks considered in this project
              arise in  numerous applications.  These include several areas of the nervous 
              system, respiration, movement, secretion, and models for scene  segmentation. 
              The project examines models for bursting  oscillations in pancreatic beta
              cells.  These cells are responsible  for the secretion of insulin.  It also
              analyzes models for  oscillations in various parts of the nervous system,
              including the  hippocampus and the thalamus.  The investigator also continues a
               study of scene segmentation and other aspects of visual  processing.  This
              work contributes to fundamental understanding of  pancreatic functions and a
              variety of neurophysiological  questions.
