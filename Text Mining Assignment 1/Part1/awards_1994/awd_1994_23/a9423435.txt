Abstract    :
              This project is to support a conference aimed at producing a  publication on the
              history of health and nutrition in the Western  Hemisphere.  The project
              extends previous research on health and  nutrition by analyzing skeletal
              evidence from pre-Columbian times  to the early twentieth century.  The
              research findings of sixteen  teams consisting of economics historians and
              physical  anthropologists will be presented and discussed at the conference  to
              be held in Columbus, Ohio in the fall of 1995.  Publication of  the conference
              findings will be of enormous value to scholars and  researchers interested in
              health, economic, and life-style  changes of the early peoples of the Western
              Hemisphere.
