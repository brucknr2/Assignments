Abstract    :
              9423013  Moodera  Experimental investigation of the properties of magnetic
              materials  by  the surface-sensitive technique of spin-polarized tunneling is
              the aim  of  this  research program.  In particular, electron tunneling between
               ferromagnetic metals, through ferromagnetic insulators,  and  exchange 
              effects   in   ultrathin   films,  and  at  the   interfaces   between 
              ferromagnetic metals and paramagnetic metals will be studied.   Planar  tunnel 
              junctions will use superconductors as electron-spin  detectors  at   low 
              temperature  and  voltage.   Our  recent  success  in  using  ferromagnetic 
              metals as electron-spin detectors at  room  temperature  and  higher  voltages 
              greatly broadens this  field  of  research  and  suggests technological uses. 
              %%%  Improvement of computer magnetic memory systems is currently  of  high 
              priority.   Study  of surfaces and interfaces has become  increasingly 
              pertinent from the point of present and future technology.  This is  a 
              proposal for the study of the physics of magnetic effects in thin film 
              surfaces   and   trilayers  using  the  technique  of   spin-polarized 
              tunneling.  The recently discovered large magnetoresistance effects in 
              ferro-magnetic tunnel junctions at room temperature promise  important 
              applications  for  these  effects in  READ/WRITE  sensors  and  memory 
              elements.  ***
