Abstract    :
              DMS-9423843 Yorke  This proposal studies higher dimensional  chaos. Lyapunov
              exponents measure the average rates of linear  expansion or contraction of a
              dynamical system in different  directions; a system with N positive Lyapunov
              exponents is  expanding in N linearly independent directions, thus an attractor
               of the system should be at least N-dimensional. However,  attractors and
              Lyapunov exponents can be very sensitive to  parameter changes, leading to
              "windows" in parameter space for  which the system exhibits lower-dimensional
              behavior. Also, the  fluctuations over time of the number of positive
              finite-time  Lyapunov exponents in some systems leads to important questions 
              about the shadowing properties of numerical trajectories. We will  study these
              and other fundamental aspects of dynamics systems  with multiple positive
              Lyapunov exponents.  Higher dimensional  chaos can occur in models of many
              engineering devices and in  meteorological models and climate models. This
              research will tell  us if mathematical models can suddenly get trapped in
              artificial  windows of regular behavior. These windows would be artificial in 
              that any realistic level of noise would disrupt the regular  behavior. Our
              research will also shed light on the reliability of  numerical trajectories for
              higher dimensional models. This study  is critical to realistic modeling.
