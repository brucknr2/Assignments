Abstract    :
                9423116  Schaffer      Vertebrate pigment cells are derived from the neural 
              crest,  a  set  of  cells  that also gives rise to the  craniofacial  skeleton,
               endocrine glands, the heart  and  the  peripheral  nervous  system.   This
              research will  reveal  some  of  the  mechanisms  that lead to this
              developmental diversification.  Movements   of   pigment  cells  can  be  
              followed   during  development  in  amphibian  eggs.   The  research  will  use
               molecular   techniques  and  experimental  manipulation   to  examine  the 
              interactions of neural crest cells  with  each  other,  with  the 
              extracellular matrix through  which  they  migrate  and  with the lateral-line
              sensory  system.     The  results   will  provide  new  insight  into  the 
              mechanisms  underlying pigment cell patterns,  and ultimately, a  deeper 
              understanding of how developmental patterns have evolved  to  produce the
              diversity of structure we see within and between  species.
