Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              will assist the  Department of Chemistry at University of California at
              Berkeley in the purchase of a new X-ray  diffractometer equipped with a
              high-resolution, high-sensitivity area detector with associated  computers. 
              This new instrumentation will enhance greatly research in a number of areas 
              including the following:    1)  Stereognostic Coordination Chemistry  2) 
              Lanthanide and Actinide Coordination Chemistry  3)  Coordination Chemistry of
              Biological Iron Transport  4)  Metal Complexes with Te and Se-Containing
              Ligands  5)  Transition Metal-Silicon Chemistry  6)  Synthesis and Study of New
              Electroactive Polymers  7)  Single-Source Precursors to Elaborate Solid-State
              Structures  8)  Structures of the Oxide Superconductors and Related Materials
              and  9)  Conformationally Constrained and Templated Peptides.    The X-ray
              diffractometer is used to make accurate and precise measurements of the full
              three-  dimensional structure of a molecule.  The information obtained gives
              the precise values of all  the bond distances and bond angles of a given
              molecule and it gives accurate information about  the spatial arrangement of
              the molecule relative to the neighboring molecules.
