Abstract    :
                  9423591  HOLMES   This doctoral research project integrates aspects of
              population biology and behavioral ecology to examine the patterns and
              mechanisms of habitat distribution and their population consequences of a
              Neotropical avian migrant (Setophaga ruticilla) on its wintering grounds. 
              Preliminary data suggest that females are found in distinct and perhaps less
              preferable habitats, where they experience significantly lower overwinter
              persistence (survival) and lose more weight over winter than do males in more
              suitable habitat.  The specific objectives of this research are to test whether
              social dominance is the mechanism producing this pattern of habitat occupancy,
              and to determine if there are consequences to physiological condition and
              survival.  Results of this research will contribute to understanding the
              population biology of Neotropical migrant birds, the possible causes of their
              declining abundances, and furthermore, is essential to the development of sound
              conservation strategies.
