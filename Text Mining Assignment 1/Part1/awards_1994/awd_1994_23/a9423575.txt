Abstract    :
              9423575  Meirovitch  The project will develop a  comprehensive approach to the 
              problem of mitigating the  effects of earthquakes on  structures through
              passive and  active controls.  The passive  control through base isolation  and
              damping materials will be  considered.  The active  control represents digital 
              nonlinear control in the  presence of stochastic  disturbances.  it is proposed
               to study a combination of the  passive and active control  schemes to achieve
              best  performance.  The plan is to  combine analytical  developments with
              practical  considerations, such as  computational burden and  sensor and
              actuator  technology, to design and  implement structural control.  ***
