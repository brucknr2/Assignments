Abstract    :
              9423553  McDUFF  This project will supply shipboard scientific equipment for the
                 research vessels C.A BARNES and THOMPSON, operated by the  University of
              Washington, School of Oceanography and dedicated to  use in support of ocean
              science research.    The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program
              provides funds  for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe
              conduct  of ocean science research. This Program provides support for such 
              items as deck equipment including winch systems for the deployment  and
              retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational equipment  such as radars,
              gyroscopes and earth satellite receivers to pin  point the location of research
              sites, communication equipment  including radio transceivers and satellite
              transceivers for voice  and scientific data communications and other equipment
              such as  motorized workboats for transporting scientists to and from data 
              retrieval sites.    The Project Director, Russell E. McDuff is fully qualified
              to  direct this project having had considerable experience in  overseeing the
              acquisition and installation of shipboard  equipment.      This project will
              allow the institution to acquire a readout for  wire monitoring on the THOMPSON
              and to upgrade the generators on  the BARNES.  ***
