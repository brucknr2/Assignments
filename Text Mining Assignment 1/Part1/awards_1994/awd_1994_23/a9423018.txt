Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to measure validly the treatment effects of
              giving additional income to low and middle income families.  The study uses the
              Massachusetts State Lottery as a natural experiment in which some families are
              randomly assigned additional income and some are not.  In the study, there is a
              treatment group of 400 people who won the lottery and a control group of 400
              people who played but did not win.  The subjects will be surveyed my mail and
              by phone.  The use of this natural experiment will allow the researchers to
              make valid inferences about the effects of additional income on these families
              using a rigorous definition of causality.  The people in the treatment group
              are receiving an average of $25,000 to $50,000 after taxes per year for 20
              years.  The survey questions cover such topics as labor supply, children's
              education, divorce and marriage patterns, residential choice, and savings
              behavior.  The data from the surveys will be linked to earnings records from
              the Social Security Administration.  This project should greatly enhance
              researchers' and policy makers' understanding of how additional income can
              affect people's lives.  The data collected will be of great interest to applied
              economists, other social scientists, and policy makers.
