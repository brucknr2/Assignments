Abstract    :
              9423062  Shephard       This group of 3 faculty, 2 postdoctoral associates and 
              6 graduate students has been pursuing a diverse program of  research in
              particle physics.  Its members, together with  collaborators at other
              institutions, are completing analysis  of Charm particle photo-production data
              obtained in 1990-  1991 at the Fermilab Tevatron and is searching for exotic 
              particles, glueballs and others, among data produced in an  experiment at the
              Brookhaven National Laboratory Alternating  Gradient Synchrotron,  ***
