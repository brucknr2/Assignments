Abstract    :
                94-23187  Balbus    This proposal describes a number of different projects
              involving magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) studies of the Galaxy, having in common a
              concern with differential rotation and magnetic field.  The effect of a  weak
              magnetic field upon differentially rotating gas has been shown to be a local
              instability to axisymmetric disturbances, which can influence Galactic
              evolution.  The projects are: (a) the extension and development of an existing
              Eulerian finite difference MHD code to include multiple fluids and finite
              resistivity; (b) a numerical investigation of the origin and evolution of the
              Galactic magnetic field, taking fully into account the presence of the weak
              field instability; (c) analytic and numerical studies of the Galactic halo, its
              local stability properties, and its relation to a two-dimensional magnetized
              wind; and (d) the development of an analytic formalism for, and explicit
              numerical solutions of the local gravitational collapse of an MHD fluid in the
              spiral arm regions of the Galaxy.  This last project is motivated by the need
              to have a well-defined and quantitative procedure for establishing when bound
              structure drops out of the background interstellar gas flow.
