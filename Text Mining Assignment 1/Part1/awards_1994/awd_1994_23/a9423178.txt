Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              will help the  Department of Chemistry at the Gonzaga University in the
              purchase of a dual length drybox.   This equipment will be used in the
              following areas of research:  (1) The synthesis of transition  metal porphyrin
              complexes; (2) Preparation of new solid state materials; (3) The synthesis and 
              testing of new ion-exchange materials; (4) The synthesis of new transition
              metal fluoroalkoxide  complexes.    Dryboxes are routinely used in academic,
              industrial, and government laboratories to provide an  inert atmosphere
              environment for the safe manipulation of air- or water-sensitive materials.
