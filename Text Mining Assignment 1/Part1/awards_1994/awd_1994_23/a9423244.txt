Abstract    :
              9423244  Glazman  The goal of this project is to develop a theory of charge 
              transport in an interacting electron system which is  confined to a wide
              channel.  The PI will investigate the  effect of a magnetic field on transport,
              and the structure  of the tunneling density of states on a two-dimensional 
              electron liquid in a weak magnetic field.  The study  includes finding the
              evolution of this structure with field  strength, disorder, and geometrical
              confinement and relating  it to the properties of the collective excitations of
              the  electron liquid.  The PI will use two approaches based upon  perturbation
              theory in the interaction strength and upon the  continuous medium description
              of the electron system.  The  project involves making specific predictions for
              the  observable characteristicq and comparisons with existing  experiments. 
              %%%  This theoretical project involves understanding the flow of  electrons,
              i.e., the current in a wide channel.  The PI is  known for using simple and
              intuitive physical pictures  rather than relying on more formal mathematical 
              developments.  He is considered one of the brightest  theorists in this area of
              physics in his age group.  The PI  will make specific predictions for the
              observable  characteristics and comparisons with existing experiments.  This
              work has applications to thin films and semiconducting  devices.  It is likely
              to lead to an improved understanding  of a number of experiments and is likely
              to have an impact  on future experiments.  ***
