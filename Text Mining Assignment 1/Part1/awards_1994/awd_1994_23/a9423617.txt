Abstract    :
              This proposal is for, "Electron Studies and QED".  It  involves isolating
              electrons, storing them, and studying  their behavior when their environment is
              varied in a  controlled manner.  The development of the apparatus to  control
              the environment of the electron allows a new  generation of measurements of the
              magnetic moment of the  electron and positron.  Together with quantum 
              electrodynamics (QED) theory, this will provide the most  accurate value for
              the fine structure constant.  When the  fine structure constant is measured by
              an independent  method, then QED will be subjected to its most stringent  test.
               A helium spectroscopic measurement is proposed for  this purpose.  Further
              measurements involve the study to  nonlinearities due to special relativistic
              effects in the  cyclotron motion of a one electron oscillator.
