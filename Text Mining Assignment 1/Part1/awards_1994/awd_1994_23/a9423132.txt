Abstract    :
              9423132  Kursunoglu       The approach for a unified view is central to much of 
              theoretical physics.       This conference on "Unified Symmetry: In the Large
              and In  the Small" to be held in Coral Gables on Feb. 2-3, 1995 seeks to 
              understand better the links between the smallest constituents of  matter, the
              elementary particles and the building up of large  scale structure in e.g.
              galaxies, as this occurs in for instance  the early universe.       The broad
              exchange of information and ideas in this  conference is likely to yield
              interesting new insights into there  problems.  ***
