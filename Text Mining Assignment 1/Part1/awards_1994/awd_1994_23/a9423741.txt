Abstract    :
              9423741  Allen    The  electronic structures of selected narrow band materials 
              are  measured   by   the  techniques  of  photoemission  and   inverse 
              photoemission   spectroscopies.  In   these   spectroscopes   the  interaction
              of photon with the electrons is used to determine the  spectrum  of  ionization
              and affinity energies of the  electrons.  The  experiments are performed both
              in a home laboratory  at  the  University  of  Michigan,  and  at various 
              national  synchrotron  facilities. The experimental data area analyzed by
              comparison  to  theories which treat the Coulomb interactions in different 
              ways,  and  which  provide a link between the spectra and the electrical  or 
              magnetic  properties.  Thereby the various  theories  can  be  tested,  with
              the possibility for discovering new phenomena.  The  program  relies  on strong
              collaborations with other  groups  for  providing  well characterized sample to
              measure, and  for  expert  theoretical advice and advanced calculations.  %%%
