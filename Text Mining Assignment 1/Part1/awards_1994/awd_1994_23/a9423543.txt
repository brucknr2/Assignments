Abstract    :
              9423543  Denno   The persistence of predator populations is primarily determined
              by the resources available to the predator in a given environment. When
              resources decline, predators starve or emigrate and predator populations do not
              persist. Omnivorous predators, however, can escape starvation or preclude
              emigration by feeding on plants and persist in environments with low prey
              densities. When prey are scarce, with each additional prey item eaten, the
              omnivorous predator consumes an increasingly larger proportion of the prey
              population, further suppressing the prey population and ultimately resulting in
              the local extinction of the prey. Omnivorous predator-prey interactions have
              received considerable theoretical attention and there are numerous examples of
              omnivorous insects distributed among diverse taxa, however, no study has
              attempted to determine the importance of phytophagy in the persistence of both
              omnivore and prey populations. This dissertation research will examine the role
              of phytophagy in the population persistence of the omnivorous predator, the
              big-eyed bug, and its aphid prey, a significant pest on soybeans. A series of
              laboratory and field experiments will determine if the bug can survive periods
              of low food availability by eating different quality of plant material and
              different stages in the life cycle.    This research will address important
              issues in predator-prey dynamics including the vital role of omnivory in
              maintaining predator populations during periods when prey items are scarce. In
              addition, this research will have direct applications related to biological
              control of aphid pests on soybeans, and the potential damage to soy beans
              caused by the control agent, rather than the aphid.
