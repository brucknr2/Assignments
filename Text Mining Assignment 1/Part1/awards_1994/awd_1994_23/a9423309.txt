Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9423309  Ann Anderson      The proposal is to support a planning
              study for the PI to learn in depth the technological issues in the role of heat
              transfer in the human body, and to plan an experimental program in bio-heat
              transfer.  Important applications presently exist in cancer therapy, tissue
              freezing, cryosurgery, and human thermal comfort.  This grant will aid in the
              shift of an established researcher into this field.  It will serve as the basis
              for developing a Career Advancement Award or full proposal in this field in the
              future.
