Abstract    :
                ABSTRACT    CTS -- 9423736     A small (10-15 person) workshop will be
              organized and held on the accuracy and calibration of heat flux sensors for use
              in convective and radiative transfer measurement. The workshop will be
              organized by Prof. Robert J. Moffatt of Stanford University, and will bring
              together eminent researchers in heat flux sensor development and use. The
              workshop will be jointly sponsored and funded by NIST, which has an equal
              interest in the area.
