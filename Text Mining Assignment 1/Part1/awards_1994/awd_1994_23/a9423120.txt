Abstract    :
              This proposal is concerned with the interaction of the solar wind,  or other
              flowing plasma, with non-magnetic solar system bodies such  as Venus, Mars,
              Titan and comets.  Research in this area  contributes to a broader
              understanding of solar-planetary relations  in general and of comparative
              magnetospheres and ionospheres.  The  research emphasizes two particular
              aspects of solar wind  interactions with non-magnetic planets:  (1) collisional
               interactions between plasmas and neutrals, and (2) evolution of  plasma
              distribution functions in induced magnetospheres.   Specifically, proposed
              research tasks are:  (1) completing a two-  dimensional, magnetohydrodynamic
              model of the inner coma of comet  Halley, (2) developing a two-dimensional, MHD
              model of the  ionospheres of Mars and Titan, (3) investigating cometary pickup 
              ions using test particle methods and quasi-linear theory, and (4)  studying
              superthermal neutral and ion populations in the inner coma  of comet Halley.
