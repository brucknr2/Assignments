Abstract    :
              This award is for support for a two year project to use seasonal  oxygen-isotope
              records from existing ice cores to provide a means  of linking the surface of
              the Greenland ice sheet to the global  climate system through the analysis of
              climatic data, atmospheric  circulation patterns and other environmental
              indicators.  The  proposed research will investigate the spatial and temporal 
              variability of seasonal oxygen isotope signals from a  geographically diverse
              set of ice cores, determine their  applicability as indicators of regional
              climatic conditions, and  determine the ice-climate relationship through
              intercomparison of  ice core oxygen isotopic records, instrumental climate
              records  and atmospheric circulation from the recent past.   The  statistical
              methods to be used include principle component  analysis, linear trend analysis
              and stepwise multiple regression  of both surface temperature and circulation
              anomalies.
