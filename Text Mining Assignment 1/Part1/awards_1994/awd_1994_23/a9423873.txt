Abstract    :
              The aim of this research is to investigate strengthening mechanisms in deposited
              epitaxial single-crystal nitride/metal superlattices where the layers have
              different slip systems.  Materials systems are NbN/Mo, NbN/W, VN/Cr, AlN/Mo,
              and AlN/W, providing both cubic-B1/cubic-BCC and hexagonal-wurtzite/cubic-BCC
              combinations. Both (001) and (111) oriented MgO and W substrates are used.  It
              will be determined if AlN can be grown in a cubic structure when surrounded
              with cubic (001) layers. These materials should exhibit large strength and
              hardness enhancements due to the superlattice structure. Correlations between
              layer characteristics, strength, and hardness will provide new information on
              strengthening mechanisms.  Changes in the layer lattice mismatch (in
              superlattices containing alloy VN-NbN or Cr-Mo layers) are used to produce
              superlattices with both coherent and incoherent interfaces.  Unlike
              previously-studied nitride/nitride superlattices, these layers are immiscible
              such that the structures are stable and retain their desirable characteristics
              at high temperatures. Structure a nd property studies versus annealing time and
              temperature are carried out, and the results compared with results from
              nitride/nitride superlattices. %%% There is technological interest in
              nitride/nitride superlattices where early results show dramatic improvements
              over conventional nitride coatings in cutting tools.
