Abstract    :
              The primary objective of this research is to design improved methods of
              visualizing uncertainty in  scientific displays.  A secondary objective is to
              identify and calculate uncertainty from data and  algorithms.  Almost all
              scientific data contain uncertainty, which are as important to the proper 
              interpretation of the results as the original data.  However, very few
              visualization techniques depict  uncertainty.  This research will take two
              approaches: mapping uncertainty information as an additional  piece of data and
              creating new visualization primitives and abstractions.  The researchers will
              use  experimentation, metrics, and application expert(s evaluations to find the
              right combination of  techniques.  Visualization is a valuable tool in
              understanding large amounts of data and the  phenomenon represented by these
              data.  Complete specification of data should include uncertainty.  The 
              resulting techniques should significantly improve all visualization and
              graphics applications where  data uncertainty is a concern.
