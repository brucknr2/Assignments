Abstract    :
              9423577  Sytsma   The investigators propose a morphologic and molecular
              phylogenetic study of a diverse group of plants, the tribe Coleeae, from
              Madagascar and Africa.  Within Madagascar the tribe has undergone tremendous
              diversification in habit, habitat, leaf form, floral and fruit features, and in
              reproductive biology.  Testable hypotheses are proposed involving the evolution
              of floral characters and breeding systems.   %%%   The study is an example of
              the value of phylogenetic systematics to understanding ecological
              diversification.   ***
