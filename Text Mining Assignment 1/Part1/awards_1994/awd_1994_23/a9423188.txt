Abstract    :
              9423188  Dusanic      Trypanosoma musculi is a protozoan parasite which resides
              in the bloodstream of the infected mouse.  It lacks intracellular stages and
              provokes a protective immunity against reinfection after the parasites
              (trypanosomes) are cleared from the general circulation.  Parasites can not be
              detected and there is no evidence of an active infection.  However,
              trypanosomes persist in the capillaries (vasa recta) of the kidneys long after
              they can no longer be found in the peripheral blood and other tissues.  This
              host-parasite relationship provides a model for studies of latent infections in
              immune hosts.  This project is designed to describe the precise locations of
              the parasites in the vasa recta.  It will describe their morphology and
              reproductive activities, their interactions under conditions in the vasa recta,
              and their biochemical and surface characteristics.  The data obtained will
              indicate whether these kidney forms represent a unique stage in the
              trypanosome's life cycle and provide insights into the persistence of the
              parasites in the immune host during latent infections.  ***
