Abstract    :
              INT-9512799  Bilham   Description:  This proposal will add a collaborative
              component to  a research project in Central Asia that is currently supported by
               the Division of Earth Sciences, Geophysics Program.  It will  activate a newly
              begun collaboration between Roger Bilham of the  University of Colorado and
              Vinod Gaur/ John Paul of the Centre  for Mathematical Modeling, Indian
              Institute of Sciences,  Bangalore.  The researchers have developed a large
              field program  to determine: the shift in latitude of the Indian subcontinent, 
              the deformation in southern India, the rate of convergence of  India and Tibet,
              and they will conduct measurements in Nepal that  will provide a measurement
              interval for the Nepal survey.  Their  measurements will permit
              characterization of future regions of  enhanced seismic potential, establish
              the rate of growth of the  Himalaya, and the recurrence interval for great
              earthquakes  there.   Scope:  The investigators seek funds to support travel to
              India  and minor expenses to supplement field research costs.  This  research
              will determine the renewal time for earthquakes in India  and Nepal and
              identify regions of potentially enhanced seismic  risk in Peninsular India. 
              Since the destructive Latur earthquake  of 1993, there is great urgency to
              accomplish the goals of this  research.      ***
