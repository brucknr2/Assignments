Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  John P. O'Connell  University of Virginia  CTS-9423622    The
              objectives of the proposed research are to perform computer simulations of
              mixed micelles systems for which experimental and theoretical results leave
              uncertainties of equilibrium structure and transient behavior.  The effects of
              chemical constitution and composition will be determined for aggregate
              stability, for chain conformation and dynamics and for solute conformation and
              distribution with model surfactants of varying chain length, head size and
              interactions, and for chain substitutions including side chains and
              perflourination.
