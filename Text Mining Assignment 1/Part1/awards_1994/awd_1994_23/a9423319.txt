Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              will assist the  Department of Chemistry at the University of Colorado--Boulder
              in the purchase of a Raman  spectrometer with a laser excitation source tunable
              in the visible region.  This equipment will  enhance research in a number of
              areas including the following:  (a)  Investigation of the  Interaction between
              3-Chlorocatechol and the Active Site of Catechol 1,2-Dioxygenase II;  (b) 
              Application of Resonance Raman Spectroscopy for the Determination of the
              Vibrational  Reorganization Energies in Charge Transfer Complexes; and (c) 
              Matrix Isolation (MI)  Raman Spectroscopy.    Raman spectroscopy is concerned
              with vibrational and rotational transition in molecules, similar  to infrared
              spectroscopy.  The information obtained from a Raman spectrometer sometimes 
              complements that obtained from an infrared study and provides valuable
              structural information.
