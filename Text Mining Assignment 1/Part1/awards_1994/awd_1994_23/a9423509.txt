Abstract    :
                Natural selection is one of the evolutionary forces proposed to maintain
              genetic variation within a population.  However, few good examples of selection
              maintaining variation in a natural population have been found.  One convincing
              example of this type of selection occurs at the major histocompatibility
              complex (or tissue typing complex).  Yet several recently discovered MHC loci,
              HLA-E and -F, were reported to have significantly less variation than other MHC
              genes.  If so, it is likely that these loci are under the influence of a
              different type of selection, one that does not maintain variation in a
              population.  Instead, these genes may have undergone a selective sweep or may
              be evolving neutrally.    For this doctoral dissertation research project, the
              investigator will study the amount of variation in HLA-E and HLA-F using a
              technique called single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis.  Next, she
              will determine the nucleotide changes responsible for this variation by
              sequencing variant SSCP bands.  Based on patterns of nucleotide diversity and
              using statistical tests for selection such as the newly developed
              McDonald-Kreitman test and the HKA test of Richard Hudson.  Inferences shall be
              drawn regarding the selective forces that are influencing these genes.
