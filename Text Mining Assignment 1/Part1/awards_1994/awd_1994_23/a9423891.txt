Abstract    :
              This award supports summer research by undergraduates at the  University of
              Missouri.  The 8-week program emphasizes  various areas of genetics and cell
              and molecular biology,  and includes attendance at seminars and participation
              in  other group activities as well as work on a specific  research project. 
              Development of the students'  communications skills by presentation of results
              at local or  regional scientific meetings will also be encouraged.
