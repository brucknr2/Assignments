Abstract    :
              9423506  This project is an enhancement to the treatment of sea ice  in a
              comprehensive numerical environmental model  -- the  Global Environmental and
              Ecological Simulation of  Interactive Systems (GENESIS) model -- being
              developed by  the National Center for Atmospheric Research.  The  enhancements
              will include a more physically representative  surface albedo, turbulent fluxes
              of heat from leads and  other openings in the ice, and the shear strength of
              the  sea ice cover.  An additional goal of the project is to  investigate the
              effects of some approximations used in the  GENESIS model that have not been
              adequately studied, and  which may be the source of seasonally anomalous 
              distributions of ice.  These include the treatment of ice  deformation as a
              cavitating fluid and the assumption of a  linear thickness distribution.  The
              output of the enhanced  GENESIS model will be tested and validated with a
              stand-  alone sea ice model and with existing arctic surface data.  ***
