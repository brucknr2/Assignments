Abstract    :
              Boyer  9423752     Earlier the proposers discovered a class of 3-Sasakian
              manifolds; in the process gave explicit examples of simply connected strongly
              inhomogeneous Einstein manifolds of positive scalar curvature. The proposed
              problem here is to classify, topologically and differentiably, the
              aforementioned compact simply connected 3-Sasakian manifolds. They also studied
              the topology of the space of based holomorphic maps from the Riemann sphere to
              a complex flag manifold, motivated by the instanton moduli work of Segal; gave
              a stability theorem. This led to their solutions (Boyer and Mann in
              collaboration with Hurtubise and Milgram) of the Atiyah-Jones conjecture. They
              propose to extend the scope of the stability (and rationality) theorem to
              include certain almost homogeneous target spaces other than the flag manifolds.
                The proposed research is in the interface of differential topology and
              differential geometry; it may lay a mathematical foundation for parts of gauge
              theories, which serve as theoretical models for various unified field theories,
              in mathematical and theoretical physics.
