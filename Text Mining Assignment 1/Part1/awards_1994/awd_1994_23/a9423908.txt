Abstract    :
              CUHEL  9423908    This project is a renewal of an on-going REU SITE in
              environmental  aquatic science research.  The research opportunities include 
              studies in the chemistry, geology and/or biology of lakes and  oceans.  The
              combined activities provide the students with an  appreciation of many of the
              elements encountered in a career in  aquatic sciences.
