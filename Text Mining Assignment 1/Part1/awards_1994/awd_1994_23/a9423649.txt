Abstract    :
              SBR-9423649  Yeon-Koo Che    One of the great success stories of the application
              of game theory to economics has been in the analysis and design of auctions. 
              This has been highlighted by the recent federal auctions of licenses for the
              use of parts of the radio spectrum.   Although auction theorists have succeeded
              in making their models more and more realistic, they have so far ignored the
              financial constraints of the bidders.  This project will begin to redress this
              by evaluating the effect of financial constraints on bidding behavior when such
              constraints are not public information, but rather carefully guarded secrets. 
              The investigator has already determined that under many common auction rules
              the good being auctioned off is not necessarily sold to the bidder who values
              it the most.  Furthermore, the presence of financial constraints favors the use
              of lotteries and tends to favor the all-pay auction over the first-price
              sealed-bid auction.    The research will be conducted in three parts.  Part 1
              considers the standard monopoly model in which a single seller sells a
              homogenous good to a continuum of sellers.  In Part 2, the investigator looks
              at the auction of a single good to many potential buyers.  Part 3 examines the
              desirability of low-interest, seller-provided financing.  Other promising
              avenues of research are: joint bidding, mergers, and the design of
              privatization and bankruptcy policies.
