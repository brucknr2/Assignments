Abstract    :
              9423215  Riess  This research will specify and estimate new empirical models of 
              entry and exit.  The proposed empirical models fit into a  developing
              literature that explains the evolution of industrial  concentration and its
              effect on interfirm competition.  A  long-run goal of this research is to
              address competition issues  that arise in antitrust economics, industrial
              policy, and  international trade.  The proposed models distinguish between 
              technological, demand, and strategic factors that affect  entrants' willingness
              to compete with established firms.  An  important goal is to model the effect
              that product  differentiation has on the extent of competitive entry.  The 
              research also addresses dynamic issues, including the role of  sunk costs in
              the timing of entry and exit.  The research will  use unique data on the
              location and sales of new and used car  dealers to test the models.  The
              empirical analysis will  illustrate the applicability of the proposed methods. 
              The  specific results will provide information about the role of  dealer
              systems in promoting retail competition.  As part of the  proposal, the author
              will assemble new information on consumer  search patterns and transactions
              prices.  These data will permit  desegregate studies of substitution patterns
              among overlapping  brands and dealers.  It also will provide useful information
               about how consumer behavior is influenced by market structure.  ***
