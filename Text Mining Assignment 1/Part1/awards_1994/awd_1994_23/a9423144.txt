Abstract    :
                This research addresses the problem of structure inference from  sparse data.
              In 2-D, for instance, the idea is to infer curves from  points or oriented
              edges. In 3-D, it is to infer surfaces from  points, curve elements, or surface
              elements. The idea is to  explicitly detect junctions between curves or between
              surfaces. The  approach involves a non-linear polling, in which active sites 
              "vote" by generating likely continuation patterns. The result of  this poll is
              a saliency map where compatible votes reinforce each  other, and incompatible
              ones do not interact. The implementation is  in the form of a non-linear vector
              convolution.  This research will  integrate the 2-D scheme with edge detection;
              derive a saliency  operator to detect and make use of end-pointformations in
              2-D;  combine intermediate results from the various 2-D saliency  operators;
              derive operators to infer surfaces, edges, and vertices  in sparse 3-D data;
              and adapt line and surface extraction  techniques to work with the saliency
              maps.  This research should  enable improvement of existing edge detectors by
              improving contours  and making junctions and end-points explicit; enable
              inference of  illusory contour from end-point formations; and enable inference
              of  dense surfaces from sparse stereo or motion matches, even in the  presence
              of transparencies.
