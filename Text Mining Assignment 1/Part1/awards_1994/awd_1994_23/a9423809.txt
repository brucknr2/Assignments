Abstract    :
              9423809  Sobsey  This is an award to support International Travel by the
              applicant  to attend and participate in the First International Conference  on
              Molluscan Shellfish Safety.  He has been invited to present a  paper titled
              "Improved Detection of Enteric Viral Pathogens and  Indicators in Oysters and
              their Habitat Waters."  The conference  plan includes field visits to
              commercial shellfish growing areas  and an associated research facility.  The
              applicant also plans on  visiting with the Australian Water Technologies Board
              in Sydney  to discuss potential collaborative research on coastal waste 
              management and related issues that affect shellfish sanitation  and otherwise
              impact coastal water quality.    This conference is a sequel to the 1989 and
              1992 international  conferences on shellfish depuration that were held in
              Florida and  France, respectively.  Results associated with supporting the 
              applicant's participation in this Conference and related  activities in
              Australia are expected to include information that  can be utilized in planning
              the scope of future program support  of research on waste management issues of
              special significance to  coastal regions of the United States.  ***
