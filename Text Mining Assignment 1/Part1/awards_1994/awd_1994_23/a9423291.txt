Abstract    :
                9423291  Cole    This is a three-year supplementary grant proposed by Drs. 
              Peter Cole and Gabriella Hermon, University of Delaware and  Dr. James Huang,
              University of California at Irvine.   The  purpose of this study is to expand a
              current research  project (SBR-9410740) supported by SBER on long distance 
              reflexives to add an international component to include,  Malaysia and
              Singapore.   The principal investigators  propose to collaborate with three
              researchers in Singapore  and Malaysia to collect  field research data on
              reflexives  in language in SE Asia.   Dr. Cole and his collaborators are 
              specialists in this linguistics area and are experts in  languages of East and
              Southeast Asia which are known to be  of direct relevance to the theoretical
              issues under study.  Three U.S. graduate students  will be involved in the 
              analysis of the data gathered in the course of the research  and will use the
              data for their graduate studies.  This is a  mutually beneficial project, the
              U.S. scientists will have  access for important field data in linguistics while
              the  foreign collaborating scientists will work directly on a  project at the
              cutting edge of current linguistic theory.
