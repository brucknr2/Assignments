Abstract    :
              94-23305  Marcus  Prof. Marcus will model numerically the east-west winds in the
               upper troposphere (i.e., the visible cloud layer) of Jupiter and  Saturn,
              using 3-D fluid-dynamics.  The principal objective is to  improve our
              understanding of why the winds are structured in zones  or bands with
              alternating velocity directions from the equator to  the poles.  Additionally,
              the Principal Investigator (PI) will  address other unresolved issues of those
              giant planets' atmospheres  -- the number of bands, the magnitude of the wind
              velocities, the  greater velocities of the Saturnian winds compared to the
              Jovian  winds, and the relationship between the winds and the vortices 
              embedded in them.    The motivation for the work is that, unlike thermal
              convection in  stars which can be reproduced and studied under laboratory 
              conditions (albeit in simplified form), the mechanism of "east-  west" winds of
              planetary atmospheres has not been modeled in the  laboratory and all proposed
              methods for creating such winds remain  mere conjectures.  Yet we cannot claim
              to understand the outer  planets until we understand their east-west winds.   
              The PI will base his calculations on two different sets of  assumptions: (1)
              The winds' vertical depth extends over tens of to  several hundred density
              scale heights; and (2) the winds are  confined to a thin vertical layer.  The
              point is to decide between  the two kinds of theories.  The calculations will
              be done in both  spherical and parabolic geometries.  The latter geometry has
              the  advantage that a parabolic dish containing a stable fluid overlying  a
              convecting fluid can be built in a laboratory to test the  validity of the
              numerical results, an experiment the PI is  suggesting to be carried out by
              others.
