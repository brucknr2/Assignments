Abstract    :
              9423193       A Block Travel Grant award covers expenses incidental  to the
              participation of students and young scientists in the  Moriond Workshop on
              Tests of Fundamental Laws in Physics on  January 22-28, 1995 in Villars sur
              Ollon, Switzerland.  The  annual Moriond workshops provide an opportunity for
              close  interaction among physicists in a number of disciplines  whose common
              interests in general fundamental problems  provide the theme of the meetings. 
              The sessions are  organized around presentations in diverse fields of physics 
              - Dark matter in cosmology, Clocks, and Low-energy nuclear  tests of
              fundamental laws.  ***
