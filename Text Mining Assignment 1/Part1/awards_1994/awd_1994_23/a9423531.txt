Abstract    :
              Theoretical investigations suggest that nonconstant resource supplies play an
              important role in maintaining species diversity.  However, for most organisms,
              explicit mechanisms enabling species coexistence due to resource variation are
              unknown.  In the proposed study, the role of phosphorus (P) and light
              variations in maintaining species diversity in algal communities will be
              investigated, and the potential mechanisms of coexistence will be tested. 
              Among these are the role of efficient resource storage and rapid induction of
              photosynthesis.  After screening experiments with multispecies algal
              communities, six algal species that differ in their abilities to grow under
              several regimes of constant and fluctuating light and P supply will be chosen. 
              Their kinetics of P- and light-dependent growth then will be determined.  Next,
              a mathematical model will use these kinetics to predict the competitive
              dynamics over a wide range of light and P fluctuations.  These predictions will
              be tested in numerous competition experiments.  This combination of
              physiological and community experiments wit h mechanistic theory will allow the
              explicit testing of theory and of the role of non-equilibrium conditions in
              these communities.  Thus, this will indicate the degree to which the knowledge
              of species physiology can be used to predict the dynamics and structure of
              competitive communities.
