Abstract    :
              This award provides funds for a Research Experience for Undergraduates Site in
              Cognitive Science at Carlton College.  The project provides for a ten week
              summer research experience for eight undergraduates.  Students will work
              individually with faculty collaborators designing and executing different
              research projects.  Weekly seminars will involve discussion of broader issues
              relevant to the research projects and to cognitive science more generally. 
              Issues of ethics in research design will be stressed.  The common theme of the
              project is `Acquiring, Organizing, and Using Knowledge.`  Individual projects
              include an investigation of self-verification processes, the application of
              PROLOG programming in knowledge representation, a study of real-life decision
              making, an investigation of the processes used in racial stereotyping, and a
              survey of how students acquire full understanding of biological principals.   
              This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract
              talented students into careers in science through active undergraduate research
              experiences.
