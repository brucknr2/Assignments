Abstract    :
              9423142  Schlein       This grant supports research in particle physics that 
              focuses on study of B-meson decays seeking effects of, and  explication of, CP
              violation in electroweak interactions.  Experiments are planned to take place,
              first at the HERA  accelerator complex in Germany and later at the Large Hadron
               Collider (LHC) at the CERN laboratory in Switzerland.  Both  are international
              effects that involve physicists from many  foreign as well as U.S.
              institutions.  The experiments will  address one of the most important problems
              confronting  physics.  ***
