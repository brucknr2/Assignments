Abstract    :
              Singhal   This project provides partial funding to support a workshop on
              international technology and operations management to be held at the University
              of Baltimore, which will also serve as the host.  Other collaborating
              universities sponsoring the workshop are Harvard, Columbia, Stanford, Tulane,
              Georgetown, and Indiana.  Topics to be covered in the workshop include problems
              in product design, manufacturing, and decision making in the supply chain.  
              International technology and operations management is critical to the
              competitiveness of a nation.  Yet, the development of the field is weak.  The
              workshop will provide a forum whereby researchers in the field can share
              information on research and course development to spur additional activities in
              the area.  Given the global competitiveness of manufacturing today, the
              involvement of the business and management academic units is crucial for
              profitable manufacture.  The involvement of these academic units will provide
              the avenue through which students of business can have a better understanding
              of the complex decisions required of a manufacturing enterprise in product
              design, manufacturing, and marketing.
