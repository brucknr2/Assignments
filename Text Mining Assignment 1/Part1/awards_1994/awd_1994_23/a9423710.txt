Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator proposes a workshop to be held  January 8-10,
              1995, at the National Center for Atmospheric  Research.  This workshop will
              involve scientists that were engaged  in the analysis and interpretation of
              measurements made during the  10 day World Day Run in January, 1993.  Potential
              topics include  coupling between the upper and lower atmosphere; determination
              of  the spectral content of the winds and temperatures from 80 to 300  km;
              multi-day waves; gravity waves and electrodynamics.
