Abstract    :
              9500436  Wittrup  This conference will bring together leaders, practitioners,
              and  students to discuss the latest ideas and discoveries in  biochemical
              engineering, and will emphasize efforts to expand the  intellectual and
              industrial scope of biotechnology and the  contributions which biochemical
              engineers can make to this  expansion.  The theme of the conference is that
              biotechnology is  increasingly an interdisciplinary endeavor, requiring
              knowledge,  methods, and expertise from biochemistry, genetics, chemistry, 
              computer science, and chemical engineering to identify the most  critical
              problems, to formulate the most creative and successful  strategies, and to
              implement the most novel and profitable  solutions.  This interdisciplinary web
              of interactions is  critical for the development of new products using
              biotechnology,  and new processes for synthesizing and purifying the products
              of  biotechnology.  ***
