Abstract    :
              9423889  Ezekiel    Massachusetts Institute of Technology  "Research in
              Networked Multimedia Information Services - DUET Additions"    This project was
              requested and funded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA).  NSF is
              handling the award because of its interest in this and related projects, some
              joint-funded with ARPA.  The award supports a 13 month project to deploy a 300
              gigabyte, network attached, modem accessible super-server to a DOD/ARPA
              specified militaryy installation; loading CD-RO,based programs onto the server;
              and conducting research on the technologies and economics of dial-up, low
              bandwidth local access to it and other digital libraries.  Four PC/workstations
              with modems are being supplied to  field test sites, and eight rack-mounted
              modems are being installed at the server site.  The services are being provided
              over ISDN lines.     DUET in the title stands for Dual Use Education and
              Training, referring to military and civilian education applications.  Most of
              the effort is being performed under a subcontract from MIT to Dartmouth College
              and Medical School.
