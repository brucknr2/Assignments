Abstract    :
              9423678  Lacey    Bilinear operators are a source of very difficult questions in
              harmonic analysis and ergodic theory. A major focus in the current project is
              the bilinear Hilbert transform. In particular, the investigator will study the
              difficult problem of Calderon involving the square integrability of the value
              of this transform. The approach will involve a synthesis of ergodic and Fourier
              transform techniques.    Mathematical analysis involves the study of
              qualitative and quantitative information about solutions of equations.
              Frequently, real world equations can be viewed as operator equations and the
              analysis of solutions involves estimates on operators both globally and
              locally. This project involves estimation on the value of bilinear operators,
              that is, operators associated with pairs of functions. The approach to these
              difficult analytical questions will involve a synthesis of several deep
              branches of analysis.
