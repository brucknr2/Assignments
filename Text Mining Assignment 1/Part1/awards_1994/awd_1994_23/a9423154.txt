Abstract    :
              9423154  Galbraith    This U.S.-Czech research project between Dr. David
              Galbraith of  the University of Arizona and Dr. Jaroslav Dolezel of the Czech 
              Institute of Experimental Botany will examine procedures for cell  cycle
              synchronization in meristem root tip cells, isolation of  condensed chromosomes
              from synchronized cells arrested in  metaphase, and the flow sorting of these
              chromosomes.  The  objective of this collaborative work is to construct
              chromosome-  specific gene libraries in Zea maize, using flow cytometry.  
              Results should contribute to our knowledge of chromosome  separation techniques
              which will be widely useful in future  research on plant strains carrying
              advantageous translocations.    This project in plant biology fulfills the
              program objective of  advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading
              experts in the  United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary
              talents  and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual interest  and
              competence.   ***
