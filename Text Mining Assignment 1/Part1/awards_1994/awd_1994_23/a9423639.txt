Abstract    :
              9423639  Perry    This research project analyzes, within the framework of
              pluralist  theory, the impact that black political participation has had on 
              the governmental allocation of benefits to blacks in 14 U. S.  cities for the
              period 1945-1994.  The study provides a  comparative longitudinal analysis of
              the impact of black  political participation on the governmental allocation of 
              benefits to blacks in these 14 cities and examines the value of  pluralist
              theory for explaining the observe impact.   Methodologically, the study employs
              pooled time series analysis  to examine the relationship between black
              political participation  and the governmental allocation of benefits to blacks
              over the  50-year time frame of the study.  Multiple regression will be  used
              to determine how much of the variance in the governmental  allocation of
              benefits to blacks is explained by black political  participation, at specific
              time points (one year time points), as  compared to other independent variables
              which may also affect the  governmental allocation of benefits to blacks.   
              This project should substantially enhance our understanding about  black
              politics and urban politics.  ***
