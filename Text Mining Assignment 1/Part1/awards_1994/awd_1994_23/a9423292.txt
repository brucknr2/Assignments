Abstract    :
              This proposal is for continuing research on coherence  effects in quantum
              optics.  The research projects include  new experimental tests to demonstrate
              the violation of local  realism without the use of Bell inequalities,
              experiments to  test the validity of the operational approach to the phase  of
              a quantum field and investigation of the elastic  scattering component in
              resonance fluorescence from a two-  level atom and its possible use in some
              quantum interference  experiments.
