Abstract    :
              This grant supplies funding to the University of Texas at Austin for
              oceanographic instruments to be used aboard the R/V LONGHORN in support of
              NSF-funded research projects.  The LONGHORN is a 105 foot vessel that is owned
              and operated by the University.  The instrumentation requested includes a water
              sampling frame, water bottles, a fluorometer, a dissolved oxygen sensor, and a
              transmissometer.  The instrumentation is required for the successful completion
              of NSF-funded projects aboard the vessel during 1995 and will enhance the
              capability of the vessel in the future.
