                 This research is directed toward understanding the evolution  of  swimming
              locomotion in bony fish, the most diverse group  of  vertebrates.   It will
              demonstrate how muscle  structure  and  function  change during development  in
               each  of  four  families  of fish, and how those changes affect  the  "fast- 
              start"  ability  of the fish.  The research will  show  what  changes  in 
              muscle anatomy or physiology underlie  superior  locomotor performance in fish,
              and show how such changes are  correlated with evolutionary success.  The
              results will lead  to  increased understalding of the constraints  that  muscle
               development  place  on  the ecology  of  larval  fish,  with  possible 
              application in managing populations of  particular  species.
