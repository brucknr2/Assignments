              and Applications of Cyclostationary Imperial                Orthogonal
              Functions    This grant is to develop a new statistical technique utilizing 
              cyclostationary empirical orthogonal functions to detect and  predict forced
              climate change signals.  The efficacy of this  interesting method to measure
              the strength of even relatively faint  signals is to be tested and evaluated by
              this grant.
