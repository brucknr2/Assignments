Abstract    :
              With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Porter of Duke
              University  will explore the mechanisms of reactions involving organic free
              radicals.  These rather  transitory intermediates are having increasing impact
              on both the organic and the chemical  community at large.  More specifically,
              free radical induced polymerization of monomers  is a major commercial pathway
              to useful products.  Moreover, control of the chirality of  these
              polymerization reactions at the evolving stereogenic centers represents a very 
              significant advance.  This proposal addresses these issues very creatively.   
              Discovering means to control organic reactions so as to produce desirable and
              useful  products in a significant goal to have major impact.  This grant
              outlines an investigation  which, if successful, will discover new ways of
              controlling the reaction of free radical  polymerization monomeric subunits. 
              Since these subunits are natural resources, this work  prescribes a methodology
              whereby a significant improvement can be made in their use.   This means an
              increase in the efficiency and a major saving of resources.
