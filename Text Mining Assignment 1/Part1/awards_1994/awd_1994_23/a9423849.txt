Abstract    :
                PI: Sylvester  DMS-9423849    Sylvester will continue his research on inverse
              problems in partial differential and ordinary differential equations, as they
              relate to the determination of the properties of inhomogeneous media from
              measurements made on or near the outer boundary.  Applications include medical
              imaging, radar imaging, and acoustical imaging in layered and non-layered
              media.  The goal is to develop a mathematically rigorous and numerically stable
              layer stripping algorithm, first in one, and then in two and three dimensions. 
                Partial differential equations form a basis for mathematical modeling of the
              physical world.  The role of mathematical analysis is not so much to create the
              equations as it is to  provide qualitative and quantitative information about
              the solutions.  This may include answers to questions about uniqueness,
              smoothness and growth.  In addition, analysis often develops methods for
              approximation of solutions and estimates on  the accuracy of these
              approximations.
