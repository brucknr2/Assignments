Abstract    :
              The PI requests funding to purchase shipboard instrumentation in support of
              NSF-funded research.  The instruments will be used aboard the R/V PELICAN, a
              105 foot vessel, which is owned and operated by the University. 
              Instrumentation requested includes an ADCP deckbox and a fluorometer.  The
              instrumentation is requested for support of NSF-funded cruises aboard the
              PELICAN.    ??
