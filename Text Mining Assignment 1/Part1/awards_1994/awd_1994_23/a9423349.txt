Abstract    :
              9423349     Whitledge  Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is the major reservoir of
              organic  carbon in the Arctic Ocean, and as such this reservoir may also  serve
              as an important sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide.  Characterization of the
              processes controlling the concentrations  and fates of DOC is therefore
              critical for gaining a quantitative  understanding of the Arctic Ocean carbon
              cycle.  During a U.S.  Navy submarine cruise in March-May 1995 along the shelf
              breaks of  the Beaufort, Chukchi, East Siberian, and Laptev Seas, 
              approximately 1,000 samples will be collected and analyzed for  concentrations
              of nutrients, DOC, and dissolved inorganic carbon  (DIC). Approximately 100
              water samples will be analyzed for  dissolved oxygen, alkalinity, and
              chlorophyll/phaeopigments  during the cruise track.  These data will be used to
              determine  the sources of DOC to the various regions, the rates of microbial 
              remineralization processes, and the coupling between nitrogen and  carbon
              cycling.
