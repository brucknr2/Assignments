Abstract    :
              9423033  Almes  In 1993, Merit, Inc. and their study partners, Advanced Network 
              and Services, Inc., implemented a plan to provide augmented  connectivity and
              infrastructure to the southwestern U.S..  This  was done by establishing full
              switching capabilities which  support high bandwidth carrier transmission
              facilities similar to  other locations that support NSFNET backbone services.  
              Additionally, they established two direct connections to the new  switches for
              the Phillips Laboratory and the Sandia National  Laboratories, both of
              Albuquerque, New Mexico.       Since then this region has seen a growth in
              research and  education activities through further use of this connectivity.  
              This is especially true for the support of the University of New  Mexico's
              management of the Maui High Performance Computing Center  (MHPCC).  This
              project will continue to expand the high  bandwidth, wide-are networking for
              the southwest region including  the two national laboratories and will also
              include the provision  of a high-speed gateway connections for the state-wide
              network,  New Mexico Technet, that serves the entire state of New Mexico's 
              university-industrial-government research complex.    The ANS operated NSFNET
              Backbone Network has been operating since  1988 at speeds of 1.5 million bits
              per second.  A new higher  speed service of 45 million bits per second began
              operation in  1990 which now connects nineteen locations.    This Albuquerque
              connection will also benefit from the economies  of scale which are achieved
              because of the multiple organizations  which share a common infrastructure and
              common network management  facilities.
