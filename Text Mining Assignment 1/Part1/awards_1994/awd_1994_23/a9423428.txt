Abstract    :
              9423428  Rowe   This project is a  study of  the evolutionary relationships
              among living crocodylians and their closest extinct relatives (eusuchians)
              based on morphologic characters from the skull and  postcranial skeleton. The
              use of computed tomographic or CT scanning will permit study of detailed
              aspects of cranial morphology and provide an additional source of characters
              for analysis.   %%%   The study of crocodylian evolutionary relationships is
              significant in terms of including for the first time both  fossil and living
              taxa and characters from the postcranial skeleton. Beyond establishing a
              phylogeny for crocodylians, this study will investigate character evolution in
              relation to aquatic adaptation and the role of differences in developmental
              timing (heterochrony) in crocodylian evolution.  ***
