Abstract    :
              Sen  9423598   The objective of this project is to hold a workshop on the
              subject of stochastic optimization and its applications.  Stochastic
              optimization is a subset of the general subject area of mathematical
              optimization.  However, unlike most optimization techniques in which the values
              of the parameters in the model are assumed to be known with certainty, in
              stochastic optimization, this is not the case.  Stochastic optimization
              recognizes the presence of uncertainties in the values of model parameters. 
              This is an area of optimization that attempts to capture the uncertainties that
              exist in modeling and solving real life problems.  This workshop is aimed at
              providing a forum whereby researchers, industrial practitioners, and graduate
              students with interest in the subject area of stochastic optimization can meet
              to discuss current research directions and emphasis, share research results,
              and identify the  challenges and direction for future research.  Invitees to
              the workshop will consists of known researchers and industrial practitioners in
              the field.  Graduate students will be invited to gain some insights on what the
              research needs and directions are.   Stochastic Optimization has become one the
              fastest growing fields in mathematical programming.  The growth is the results
              of the increasing recognition that uncertainty plays a critical role in many
              decision making and design environments.  The various sectors in business,
              science, engineering, and the social sciences where stochastic optimization can
              be applied make the development of this subject area very critical.  A better
              understanding of how to integrate uncertainties into decision making will
              significantly improve decision making processes and ultimately, the quality of
              life.
