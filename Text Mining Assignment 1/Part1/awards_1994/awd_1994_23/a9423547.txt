Abstract    :
                   This is a women's research planning grant to prepare a study of perceptions
              of success and failure in the fall of the German Democratic Republic, that will
              advance the scientific understanding of processes of democratization.  It will
              support travel by the investigator to the former German Democratic Republic and
              consultation with German social movement scholars and activists in Berlin,
              Leipzig, and Dresden, three cities central to the civic movement mobilization. 
              Consultations will concern appropriate questions and format for an interview
              schedule and for a sampling strategy that will address the complexities of the
              changing composition of the opposition groups in the three cities over the
              course of 1989-1990, social movement careers of activists selected from these
              groups before and since that period, and differences in the composition, goals
              and success perceptions of activists in the three cities.    %%%     This grant
              will provide the information necessary for writing an NSF grant proposal to
              support interviewing in each of the three cities on differences in the
              opposition movement and the careers of activists.  This work is supported under
              the Research Planning Grant program for women scientists and engineers, and
              thus among its chief aims are to assist a promising woman social scientist to
              prepare for a major research project, and to expand the scientific personnel of
              the United States.  The results of this study will be valuable for
              policy-makers attempting to understand the social process of democratization in
              formerly totalitarian societies.
