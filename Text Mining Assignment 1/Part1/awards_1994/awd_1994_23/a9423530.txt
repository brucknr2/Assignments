Abstract    :
              This award is for support for a 3 year program to assess the  variation in the
              snow accumulation rate in northern  Greenland. Previous work has shown that
              isotope records from  shallow ice cores can be used to identify interannual and
               perhaps seasonal cycles of snow temperature and  accumulation.  In order to
              assess seasonal and interannual  variability, the isotope temperature record
              requires  calibration from in situ meteorologic measurements.  On-  going
              remote sensing research appears to show that  interannual trends in brightness
              temperature can be used as  proxy data for annual accumulation but this work
              requires  calibration from ice core data in northern Greenland.  Combining
              stable isotope measurements, remote sensing, and  surface energy balance data
              will allow an assessment of how  interannual and seasonal processes affect the
              magnitude and  variability of snow accumulation.  Meteorologic data  collection
              stations will be established and five shallow ice  cores will be drilled in a
              400 km2 area around each of two  stations, one in northeastern and one in
              northwestern  Greenland.  Argos satellite links will provide data  transmission
              capability from each remote site.  Grain size  and temperature profiles,
              sublimation, and energy balance  will be calculated using a one-dimensional
              energy and mass  flux model.
