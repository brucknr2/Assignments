Abstract    :
              This project is building an application-specific computer system  for
              biosequence comparison.  The architecture is suitable for a  wide range of
              sequence comparison methods, including the Smith-  Waterman algorithm, BLAST,
              profile searches and dictionary methods.   In addition, the architecture is
              being integrated with software for  the statistical analysis of sequences using
              techniques such as  hidden Markov models.    The core of the architecture is a
              linear array of SIMD processing  elements, each with a small local memory.  A
              single chip can  contain 64 of these elements, so a board with 20 chips will
              hold  1280 processors.  The processing elements have been tuned to  sequence
              comparison by incorporating a single cycle add-and-min  instruction and a
              data-path for quickly recording the results of  the instruction.  Software,
              I/O, and algorithms have been  considered in the design of this architecture;
              the resulting  balanced implementation should result in high performance at low
               cost.
