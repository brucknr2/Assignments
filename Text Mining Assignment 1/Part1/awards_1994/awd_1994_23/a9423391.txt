Abstract    :
              9423391  Sanchez    This U.S.-Mexico Cooperative Program award will support 
              travel and related expenses for four U.S. scientists and  three postdoctoral
              students to participate in  an  international workshop on the theory and
              applications of  the cluster variation and path probability methods to  complex
              materials systems.  The workshop will be held in  San Juan, Teotihuacan,
              Mexico, during June 19-22, 1995,  The coorganizers are Professor Juan M.
              Sanchez, University  of Texas, Austin, and Professor Jose L. Moran-Lopez, 
              Universidad Autonoma de San Luis Potosi, Mexico.  Participants will also
              include leading authorities in  this  important research area from Europe,
              Japal and Latin  America.  In addition, several students and young  scientists
              will be invited to participate.    The primary objectives of the workshop are:
              to provide an  up-to-date and in-depth review of the subject; to foster  direct
              interactions and more collaboration between U.S.,  European, Japanese and Latin
              American scientists, and to  provide an international experience to researchers
              at the  start of their careers.  ***
