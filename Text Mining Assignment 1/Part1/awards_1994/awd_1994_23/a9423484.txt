Abstract    :
              This award provides funding to purchase shipboard instrumentation in support of
              NSF-funded research.  The instruments will be used aboard the R/V ENDEAVOR, a
              177 foot vessel, which is owned by NSF and operated by the University. 
              Instrumentation includes a salinometer upgrade, an ARGOS receiver,
              meterological sensors, computers for data management, slip ring assemblies, and
              a high speed INMARSAT modem.  The instrumentation is requested for support of
              NSF-funded cruises aboard the ENDEAVOR during 1995 and to enhance the
              scientific capability of the vessel in the future.
