Abstract    :
              As   they   gain   expertise  in  problem  solving,   humans  increasingly  
              rely   on  patterns  and   spatially-oriented  reasoning.  The goals of this
              project are to  learn  pattern  associations and spatially-oriented reasoning,
              and then   to  integrate  the  knowledge to make decisions  in  conjunction 
              with  other high-level reasoning. This research develops  an  associative
              visual pattern classifier and algorithms for the  automated  acquisition of
              new, spatially-oriented  reasoning  agents.   These  components are readily 
              integrated  into  a  multi-agent  decision making program for  broad  classes 
              of  related problems. The pre-existing program robustly combines  agents   with
                conflicting  perspectives   and   withstands  incomplete  and erroneous
              evidence for the early  stages  of  learning.   It makes decisions with a
              hierarchy  of  modules  representing   individual,  limitedly  rational,  
              heuristic  agents.   Each  agent may draw upon a variety  of  knowledge  bases 
               generated   and  maintained  by   various   learning  strategies.   The  new 
              visual  pattern  classifier   learns  meaningful   patterns   from  
              experience.    In   addition,  domain-specific spatial concepts are generalized
              from  these  patterns to create new heuristic agents.
