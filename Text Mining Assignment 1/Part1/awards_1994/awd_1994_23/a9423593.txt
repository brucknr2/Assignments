                                                Abstract  (IBN 9423593)  West, Meredith   
              Experimental  evidence has shown that  many  animal  species  show   natal  
              populational  preferences  with  respect   to  reproductive  patterns.  In the
              present research,  an  avian  model  of  cultural evolution is used to explore
              how  social  learning  may  be implicated in such reproductive  patterns. 
              Different  populations of subjects are exposed for extensive  periods  to 
              distinctive social populations prior  to  their  breeding  seasons.   The
              reproductive preferences  are  then  tested.  Measurements are made of the
              proximate dynamics  of  the  development of individuals' preferences.  In 
              addition,  the  behaviors by which individuals communicate reproductive 
              preferences,  in  particular, the use of  vocalizations  and  responses   to 
              vocalizations,  are  measured.   Preliminary  results  confirm that social
              learning exerts direct  effects  on   the  transmission  of  reproductive 
              preferences.   The  proposed  studies explore in more depth the  nature  of 
              the  learning mechanisms and test whether learned preferences can  be  passed
              on to subsequent generations of individuals.   If  such   cultural,  
              transgenerational  transmission   occurs,  current  theories  and  concepts  of
               the  role  of  genetic  programs  in  guiding and determining reproductive 
              outcomes  will  have  to  re-evaluated.  New  theories  will  have  to 
              incorporate  the exogenetic or cultural mechanisms  deriving  from  models  of 
              social learning.  In that human  societies  show  analogous  dependence  on
              cultural  transmission,  the  results  of  these  studies will  provide  a  new
               and  more  ecologically appropriate model of the evolution  of  complex 
              behavior.
