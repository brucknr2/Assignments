Abstract    :
              9423848  Goldman     The goal of this project is to extend the University of
              Denver atlas of high resolution (approx. 0.002 cm-1) infrared solar absorption
              stratospheric spectra and the corresponding laboratory and theoretical studies
              initiated under previous NSF grants. The currently published high resolution
              stratospheric atlas covers several intervals between 800 and 1690 cm-1. For
              each interval, accurate line positions with molecular and atomic
              identifications are tabulated. Numerous new spectral features have been
              identified and analyzed.   The major objectives of this research are: 1) to
              extend the 0.002 cm-1 resolution atlases over additional intervals in the
              2.5-30um region, mostly with solar and laboratory spectra already obtained, and
              new spectra anticipated  to be obtained in 1994-1997; 2) to extend the
              spectroscopic  analysis of specific stratospheric molecules, such as ozone,
              nitric acid, chlorine nitrate, carbonyl fluoride, nitrogen dioxide, molecular
              oxygen, and others, from the laboratory and the stratospheric spectra.  The
              current atlas work and the supporting laboratory studies have contributed
              significantly to our understanding of atmospheric chemistry through atmospheric
              and solar spectroscopy, and further contributions are expected.
