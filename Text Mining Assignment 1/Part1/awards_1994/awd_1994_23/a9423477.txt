Abstract    :
              This award supports a three year project to determine the  morphology of the
              base of  a surge-type glacier (Black  Rapids Glacier, Alaska) using modern
              wireline drilling and  sampling techniques, along with related measurements of 
              basal water pressure, surface speed and other parameters.  The project is an
              attempt to shed light, by direct  observation, on the most important unsolved
              problem in  glacier and ice sheet dynamics: the role of basal motion and  how
              it is affected by the basal morphology.  The role of bed  morphology in glacier
              surging is of particular interest,  because the restricted geographic
              occurrence of these  glaciers may reflect necessary basal conditions.  The 
              drilling and sampling program proposed here should be able  to recover
              continuous core of virtually any length, from the  base of the clean ice,
              through any basal ice, sediments or  combination of sediments and ice, and into
              the underlying  bedrock.  Although such sampling has been accomplished  before
              in connection with mineral exploration, it would be  the first scientific
              effort of its kind in a temperate  glacier.
