Abstract    :
              9423356  McPheron    Glutathione transferases are a ubiquitous gene family 
              found  in   plants  and  animals.   Glutathione  transferases   are  involved 
              in  the  conjugation of  glutathione  to  reactive  organic   molecules, 
              especially  lipophilic  or  fat-loving  molecules  like  many pesticides and
              plant  allelochemicals.  This  research  will  analyze  glutathione 
              transferaqes  in  insecticide-resistant and insecticide-susceptible strains of 
              an  apple bud moth, and determine how this class of  enzymes  is  expressed and
              functions.  The effects of plant  extracts  of   differing   chemistries  on  
              glutathione   transferase  expression  and activity will be monitored using
              radioactive  glutathione  transferase messenger RNA  and  also  by  using 
              purified   genetically-engineered  glutathione  transferases  placed  in  E. 
              coli ( a model bacterium used in  molecular-  genetic   studies).     Defining 
              the  interaction   between  glutathione transferase expression and activity and
               foreign  organic  molecules will lead to a greater  understanding  of  the 
              mechanisms  by  which organisms deal  with  potentially  damaging    chemical  
               compounds.    Because    glutathione  transferases are found in bacteria,
              plants and animals,  the  knowledge  gained will be broadly applicable, 
              ranging  from  increased  understanding insecticide resistance to increased 
              understanding of  resistance to anti-cancer drugs in humans.
