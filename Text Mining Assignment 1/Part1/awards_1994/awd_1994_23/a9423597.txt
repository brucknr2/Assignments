Abstract    :
              This grant supplies funding to the Bermuda Biological Station for acquisition of
              shipboard instrumentation in support of NSF-funded research.  The instruments
              will be used aboard the R/V WEATHERBIRD II, a 115 foot vessel, which is owned
              and operated by the Station. The instrumentation is required for support of
              NSF-funded cruises aboard the WEATHERBIRD II during 1995 and will enhance the
              scientific capability of the vessel in the future.  Instruments funded include
              a fluorometer, a transmissometer, a rosette pylon and an IMET shortwave
              radiation sensor.      ??
