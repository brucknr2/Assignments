Abstract    :
              This grant supplies funding to purchase shipboard instrumentation in support of
              NSF-funded research.  The instruments will be used aboard the R/V WECOMA, a 177
              foot vessel, which is owned by NSF and operated by the University. 
              Instrumentation requested includes shipboard computer system upgrades, a
              fluorometer, a 3-D GPS receiver, a CTD/rosette upgrade, new meteorological
              sensors, a transmissometer, a multi-corer, and electronic testing equipment for
              the shipboard support group.  The instrumentation is requested for support of
              NSF-funded cruises aboard the WECOMA during 1995 and will enhance the
              scientific capability of the vessel in the future.      ??
