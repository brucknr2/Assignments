Abstract    :
              9423616    The Neurotransmitter dopamine has been strongly implicated in the
              physiological regulation of "simple" behaviors, such as motor control, as well
              as in higher order cognitive function.  This work addresses the functional
              consequences of perturbing the normally exquisitely regulated levels of
              dopamine in the nervous system by manipulation of the regulatory mechanisms
              directing dopamine synthesis.  The choice of Drosophila melanogaster as the
              model system facilitates the use of molecular genetic techniques to circumvent
              limitations encountered in other systems.  These studies take advantage of
              recombinant DNA methodology to (1) modulate the expression of tyrosine
              hydroxylase, the rate-limiting biosynthetic enzyme in the synthesis of
              dopamine, and (2) determine the functional consequences of perturbing these
              mechanisms in the intact animal.
