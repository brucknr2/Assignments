Abstract    :
              9423485  Flower  This award supports a project to study sediments from the
              Arctic  Gateway region.  Surface water exchange through the Arctic  Gateway at
              Fram Strait accounts for about 90% of the Arctic heat  budget and so this
              region may have played a major role in  glacial-interglacial Arctic climates
              during the Quaternary.  The  major objectives of this research include
              documenting the  Quaternary history of Arctic climates and investigating the
              role  of surface to intermediate water exchange through the Arctic  Gateway in
              late Quaternary glacial-interglacial Arctic climates.    Two sedimentary
              sequences on the Yermak Plateau, recently drilled  by Leg 151 of the Ocean
              Drilling Program, provide the first  opportunity for high-resolution studies of
              the Arctic Gateway  region.  This project will generate high-resolution
              isotopic and  faunal records based on planktonic and benthic foraminifera from 
              sites 910 and 911 forming a depth transect on the Yermak Plateau  (at 556 and
              902 m water depth, respectively).  Planktonic  records, with about 4,000 year
              resolution, will be spliced  together from both sites to form a composite
              record of surface  water environments throughout the Brunhes Epoch (late
              Quaternary  to present).  Benthic records, with about 10,000 year resolution, 
              will also be compiled.  When combined, these records will allow  detailed
              comparison of surface waters to intermediate water  environments for areas with
              550 and 900 m water depths.  These  data will allow detailed reconstruction of
              surface to  intermediate water hydrography during the Brunhes Epoch.   Extended
              records at site 911A will provide the first long-term,  high-resolution records
              of Arctic surface and intermediate water  environments throughout the
              Quaternary.    These hydrographic interpretations of the integrated isotopic
              and  faunal records will test hypotheses about the role of this  oceanic
              gateway in regional and global climatic change.  The  results will bear on the
              importance of meridional heat transport  by  Arctic Gateway surface currents
              during intervals of global  warmth and during important climatic transitions. 
              The intervals  of greatest interest include the mid-Quaternary climatic 
              transition from about 1.2-0.6 Ma, and glacial-interglacial cycles  of the
              Brunhes Epoch.  The records obtained will greatly improve  our understanding of
              the influence of the Arctic Gateway region  on the global climate system during
              the Quaternary.  In  particular, this work will examine the role of Arctic
              Gateway  paleoceanography in the Quaternary glacial evolution of the  Northern
              Hemisphere.  Lastly, it should provide insights into the  future response of
              Arctic climates to projected global warming.
