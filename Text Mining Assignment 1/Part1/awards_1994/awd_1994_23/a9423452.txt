Abstract    :
              9423452  Judd  Graduate student Gerald Guala, under the guidance of Prof. 
              Walter Judd of the University of Florida, is studying the  taxonomy, phylogeny,
              and ecology of two genera of grasses  found in savanna regions of South America
              and Africa. He is  combining technologies from two modern analytical 
              approaches: cladistic analysis of characters to infer likely  evolutionary
              relationships among the species; and computer-  based geographic information
              system (GIS) analyses to map  soil and climate measurements for individual
              populations  onto the cladograms of taxa. Comparisons between the two  genera,
              Agenium in South America and Homozeugos in Africa,  are designed to reveal
              whether similar climatic patterns are  correlated with the sequence of
              speciation (cladogenetic or  splitting) events in the two groups of savanna
              grasses.       The study is a pioneering application of GIS methodology  to the
              analysis of phylogenetic patterns in two grass genera,  occupying similar
              habitats in South America and Africa.  ***
