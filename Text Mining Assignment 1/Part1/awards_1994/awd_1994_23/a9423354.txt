Abstract    :
              Recent historical approaches to science in the late seventeenth century are
              beginning to reveal how nature and morals continued to be linked during the
              scientific revolution, with important effects on scientific theory.  This
              project examines the issue for scientists dependent on patronage, ascertaining
              how the interplay between scientific and moral values affected notions of
              conscience.  The method involves study of archives and rare book collections in
              France, Holland, England and Sweden, to examine the life and work of scientists
              associated with the Parisian Royal Academy of Sciences during the reign of
              Louis XIV.  By studying both public and private documents and records, the
              investigation can identify opposition and its motives, in relationship to views
              of cosmology, the theory of the soul and public issues of conscience.  The
              findings will clarify what moral lessons scientists inferred from nature;
              issues of conscience that troubled them; how they handled disagreements with
              patrons; the extent to which opposition could endanger a scientific career or
              scientific achievements prevent punishment; to what degree scientific matters
              sparked issues of conscience or abetted the fight for moral principle; and
              whether the necessity of opposition affected either the scientific or the moral
              principles that guided scientists' lives.  These results will be published in
              articles and a book.
