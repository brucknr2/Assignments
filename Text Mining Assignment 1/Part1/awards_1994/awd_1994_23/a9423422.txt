Abstract    :
              This award supports a two year study of the rheology of  basal ice.  The study
              has two principal parts: 1)  measurements of the ice flow field around an
              artificial  irregularity at the base of the glacier Engabreen in  northern
              Norwway; and 2) development of a theoretical  (numerical) model, that describes
              the threedimensional flow  field in basal ice.  Tunnels through the bedrock
              beneath  Engabreen, will provide the unique setting and opportunity  to
              directly measure the flow field in basal ice.  The  velocity field will be
              determined by using a video camera to  monitor the position of markers in the
              ice.  The numerical  model will be based on an existing finite element code at 
              the University of Minnesota, taking advantage of the  facilities at the
              Minnesota Supercomputer Institute.  Comparison between the model and the
              experimentally observed  flow fields will permit an evaluation of various 
              constitutive laws.  Numerical values will be determined for  the material
              constants in the models that give the best fit  to the observed flow field.
