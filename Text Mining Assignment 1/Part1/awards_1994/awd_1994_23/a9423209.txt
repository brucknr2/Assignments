Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    AST- 9423209  Narayan, Ramesh    This grant will pursue two topics.
              The first is Gravitational Lensing, the phenomenon by which light rays from a
              distant source are deflected by the gravitational influence of intervening
              galaxies. In some cases, this results in an observer seeing multiple images of
              a source. It is possible to deduce the gravitational distribution of the
              intervening mass from the observed images, and it is proposed to develop a new
              algorithm for this, based on the Maximum Entropy Method, a well-known image
              processing technique. Furthermore, when a source is multiply-images, light
              takes different lengths of time to reach the observer by different paths. By
              combining a model of the lens with the measured time difference between
              correlated variations in the image, the distance to the source can be
              estimated, which gives a value for Ho, the Hubble constant.    The second topic
              is Accretion Flows, viscous spiraling in of gas onto a compact gravitating
              mass, such as a neutron star or a black hole. The PI proposes to model the
              inner regions close to the accreting mass, whence most of the observed
              radiation derives. The neutron star and black hole cases will be treated
              differently, since gas accreting onto a neutron star ultimately slows down and
              settles on the stellar surface, whereas flow around a black hole accelerates to
              supersonic radial speeds before falling through the horizon.  ***
