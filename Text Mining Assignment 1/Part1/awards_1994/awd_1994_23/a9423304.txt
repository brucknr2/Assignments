Abstract    :
              Abstract  N. Aubry  CTS-9423304  CCUNY    At high Reynolds numbers, the number
              of excited degrees of freedom or active modes in a flow exceeds the capacity of
              available computers so that many turbulent flows of industrial and geophysical
              importance cannot be computed.  This work seeks to address theoretical and
              modeling issues in the fully develop, high Reynolds number regime of flow. 
              This work is aimed at the prediction of the most appropriated modes to describe
              the turbulence (that is, the smallest number of modes needed among all possible
              representations).  This is done by eliminating most modes and their energy
              spectra through mappings deduced from symmetry considerations.  This can be
              viewed as an alternative to "subgrid scale modeling".  The technique will be
              applied to a turbulent channel flow for which high resolution numerical data
              are available.  The predicted representation of the flow will then be used for
              turbulence modeling.
