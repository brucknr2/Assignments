Abstract    :
              This project involves the dissertation research of a cultural anthropologist
              from Stanford University.   The project is to analyze records from the Carlisle
              Indian Industrial school, one of the first non-reservation boarding schools for
              American Indians which operated in rural Pennsylvania from 1879 to 1918.   The
              project will focus on the lived experience of pupils, as revealed through
              school records and interviews with descendants of school alumni in three
              regions of the country: S. Dakota, New Mexico/Arizona, and New York.   The
              project will examine how cohorts of students changed as the social conditions
              of the home communities changed over time.  This research is important because
              it will provide a more complete picture of an institution through which the
              state shaped Indian identity.  The information the study will generate can be
              used in a variety of educationally oriented materials showing the development
              of Indian identity with respect to the state.   In the contemporary world the
              demise of the USSR has been associated with ethnic violence against a
              controlling state (i.e., Russia against the Chechens in 1994-95).  Advances in
              our understanding of how ethnic identities are formed in response to state
              policies can help policy makers avoid mistakes in dealing with ethnic
              minorities.
