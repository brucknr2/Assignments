Abstract    :
                9408047  Paegle  "Predictability Characteristics of Global and Limited Area
              Models"    Under this award, Dr. Paegle will continue his investigations of
              atmospheric predictability, and  in particular, the effects of uncertainties in
              the initial conditions, both local and remote, on  numerical predictions. 
              Studies will be carried out for global and limited-area models.   Specifically,
              he will:         1) conduct experiments with a variable resolution global
              model, using resolutions       spanning three orders of magnitude, to ascertain
              theoretical and ppactical limits of       predictability and how the limits
              depend on local, remote, and global uncertainties.  The       results should
              have practical implications for the design of numerical models and      
              observing systems.         2) perform experiments with a high resolution local
              model designed to assess the "value-       added" by resolution enhancement
              relative to the uncertainty associated with imperfect       boundary conditions
              provided from operational forecasts used to initialize the model.        The
              goal is to quantify the relative forecast improvement which can be realized
              within       the inner (local) model domain from improvements in the forecast
              skill of the outer       (regional or global) model that supplies the boundary
              conditions.    The results of this research have obvious potential for
              improving numerical weather prediction  on both short and longer time scales. 
              The Mesoscale Dynamic Meteorology and Large-scale  Dynamic Meteorology Programs
              will share in the support of this award.  ***
