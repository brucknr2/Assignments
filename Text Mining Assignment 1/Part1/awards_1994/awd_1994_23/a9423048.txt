Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry   Division,
              Professor Jan Laane of the Chemistry Department of Texas A&M   University will
              pursue investigations in order to determine the   vibrational potential energy
              surfaces of excited electronic states. The   experimental techniques to be
              employed include fluorescence excitation   spectroscopy, sensitized
              phosphorescence spectroscopy, and two-photon   spectroscopy of supersonic
              jet-cooled molecules.  The system species   include cyclic and multicyclic
              molecules, and those with internal   rotations or inversions, including various
              carbonyl compounds and `double   molecules`, i.e., those with two closely lying
              electronic states.  Far   infrared and Raman spectra will also be recorded in
              order to help with   the determination of the ground electronic state potential
              energy   surface.    Molecular-level understanding of molecular properties and
              behavior   depends upon accurate knowledge of the potential energy surfaces of
              a   molecule for its ground and excited electronic states.  The research  
              conducted in this project will furnish the requisite data and analyses   toward
              this understanding.
