Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9423228  STONE  HARVARD    A theoretical investigation of the
              oscillatory movements of a mechanical element, assumed to have the shape of a
              circular disc, will be undertaken.  Four distinct motions are investigated: (I)
              oscillatory broadside translations, (ii), oscillatory transverse translations,
              (iii) oscillatory in-plane rotations, (iv) oscillatory out-to-plane rotations. 
              This problem models a basic shape and four basic mechanical motions found in
              the design and manufacture of microelectromechanical components.  An exact
              solution for the fluid motion is outlined for the limit that convective
              acceleration of the fluid is neglected and the unsteady local acceleration term
              is retained, which is a self-consistent approximation provide the oscillatory
              amplitudes are small.  Forces and torques acting on the oscillating element
              will be calculated as function of the oscillation frequency, and the fluid's
              density and viscosity.  The viscous effects associated with fluid-solid
              friction have a significant influence on the mechanical response of components
              of microelectromechanical devices.  Consequently, the design of small
              micromachined mechanical elements, such as actuators, pumps and valves, remains
              more an art than engineering or science.  Because of their small dimensions
              (e.g. 10-100 um), viscous effects of a surrounding fluid (either air or a
              possible lubricant) are not negligible.  From the standpoint of design,
              although well developed fluid dynamical principles are applicable to steady
              flows, much less is known about unsteady viscous flows.
