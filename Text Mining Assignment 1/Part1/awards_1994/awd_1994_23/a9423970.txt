Abstract    :
              9423970  Kay      The International Junior Investigator and Postdoctoral 
              Fellows Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to  conduct three to
              twenty-four months of research abroad. The  program's awards provide
              opportunities for joint research,  and the use of unique or complementary
              facilities, expertise  and experimental conditions abroad.    This award will
              support a six-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Laura E. Kay to work
              with Associate Professor  Antonio Mario Magalhaes at the University of Sao
              Paulo in  Brazil.    This project will involve the development of a
              collaboration  for establishing the technique of spectropolarimetry at the 
              Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) in La Serena,  Chile.  Dr. Kay
              will test polarimetry optics on the  spectrograph at the 4m telescope at CTIO. 
              She will also  visit the Instituto Astronomico e Geofisico (IAG) in Brazil  to
              analyze data and explore modifications of the CTIO  spectrograph that will
              increase its usefulness.  In  addition, Dr. Kay's visit will serve to
              strengthen the  Gemini partnership involving Brazil and Chile. ***
