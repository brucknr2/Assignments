Abstract    :
              9423620  McMASTER     This award will provide group travel support to up to 10
              American cartographers to attend the bi-annual meetings of the International
              Cartographic Association, which will be held in Barcelona, Spain, in September
              1995.  Scholars supported by this award will present papers and will
              participate in ICA Commissions and Working Groups.  In addition to a
              Proceedings volume of all papers, to be distributed at the meetings, papers
              given and work developed at the meetings will receive dissemination through
              several international, refereed journals.  Past experience of American
              involvement in these meetings and of NSF support for this involvement suggests
              that American scholars play a major role in these activities, and develop
              substantial international collaboration.  The areas of cartographic research in
              which Americans are particularly active in international arenas include process
              visualization, generalization of spatial data, spatial data standards, and the
              history of cartography.     Wide solicitation of potential participants has
              already occurred.  The PI will organize a blind review of papers accepted by
              the ICA organizers to help rank participants who are applying for the travel
              assistance enabled by this award.  In addition, all NSF travel funds for
              support of Americans attending the 1995 ICA Meetings will be reserved for
              either early-career scientists who earned their Ph.D. during or after 1989, or
              for more experienced investigators who had never previously attended an ICA
              meeting.
