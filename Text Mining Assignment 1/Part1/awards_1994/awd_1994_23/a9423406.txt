Abstract    :
              This award supplies funding to purchase shipboard instrumentation in support of
              NSF-funded research.  The instruments will be used aboard the R/V LAURENTIAN,
              an 80 foot vessel, which is owned and operated by the University. 
              Instrumentation requested includes an upgrade for the CTD sensor, a new PAR
              sensor, upgrades to the conductivity sensor, and a new digital data recorder.
              The instrumentation is requested for support of NSF-funded cruises aboard the
              LAURENTIAN during 1995.    ??
