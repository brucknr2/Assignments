Abstract    :
                                          Abstract  9423285  Rosen  This research involves the
              application of two observational methods  for the study of Polar Stratospheric
              Clouds (PSCs) and ozone in the  Arctic winter vortex.  The first method uses
              balloon borne aerosol  and particle instrumentation floating with a fixed air
              mass for  many days as PSCs begin to form and evolve while at the same time 
              ozone concentrations will be measured.  The second approach  involves making
              normal balloon soundings with similar equipment at  several Arctic stations
              which, in contrast to the first method,  will provide information on the
              evolution of PSCs over a fixed  location.  This project is a continuation and
              refinement of an  ongoing successful international (U.S., Russia, Germany,
              Denmark  and Finland) effort and represents a new approach to identifying  and
              quantifying ozone loss in the Arctic Stratosphere.  ***
