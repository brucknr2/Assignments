Abstract    :
              9423921  Eastwood    Northern Arizona University (NAU), in collaboration with
              the Lowell  Observatory and the National Undergraduate Research Observatory
              (NURO),  will operate an Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in 
              astronomy.   Each summer, eight undergraduate students will be  selected, in a
              national competition, to carry out research in  Flagstaff, Arizona with an
              astronomer from NAU, Lowell Observatory, or  a visitor from another NURO
              institution.  The students' research  activities will be supplemented by their
              attending a lecture series on  current astronomical topics.  The lecture series
              will start with talks  by the REU site director on astronomical techniques and
              then talks will  be presented by various astronomers in the Flagstaff area
              about their  research.  Students will receive university credit for this
              lecture  series.  Each student will have the opportunity to observe at Lowell's
               31 inch telescope equipped with NURO's instrumentation.  In addition to  the
              lecture series, the students will write a scientific paper.  At the  end of the
              summer session, the students will present their work orally  to astronomers and
              to the other students.  The students will be housed  in one of the NAU
              dormitories.
