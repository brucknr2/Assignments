Abstract    :
              9423665  Ashley   The proposed research involves a molecular systematic study of
              the mammalian order Xenarthra (sloths, armadillos, and anteaters) and their
              close relatives the Pholidota (pangolins or scaly anteaters). The relationships
              among these taxa and with other mammalian orders remain controversial. 
              Establishing or refuting the position of the Xenarthra as a basal lineage of 
              mammals is critical for interpreting the overall pattern of mammalian
              evolution.  %%%    In addition the data will provide important information on
              the  biogeographic history of the group from its South American  origin and 
              dispersal to Central American and the Antilles. If  xenarthrans are closely
              related to pangolins which are known from Africa, Asia and Europe and possibly
              North America it suggests a testable hypothesis, divergence of these groups
              that would  have predated the separation of  Africa and South America which
              occurred 85 million years ago. This would push back considerably the timing of
              the radiation of eutherian mammals.  ***
