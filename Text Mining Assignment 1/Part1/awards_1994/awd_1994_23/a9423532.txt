Abstract    :
              9423532  Glashausser       Research will be carried out in high energy electron 
              scattering knockout reactions, photonuclear reactions, nuclear  structure
              studies based on polarization transfer, and hyperon-  nucleon interactions. 
              Research in these areas will advance our  understanding of the structure of the
              structure of the nucleus,  nucleon structure, the short range processes
              dominating lambda-  nucleon interactions, and the transition from non-nucleonic
              and  mesonic degrees of freedom as effective descriptions of processes  to
              description based on quarks.  These topics are high priority  activities in
              contemporary nuclear physics.  Development,  construction, and utilization of
              major state-of-the-art  equipment, including a focal plane polarimeter and
              specialized  detectors is integral to this activity.  Education of graduate 
              students and postdocs is  a strong component in every aspect of  this grant for
              this Rutgers Nuclear Physics group.***
