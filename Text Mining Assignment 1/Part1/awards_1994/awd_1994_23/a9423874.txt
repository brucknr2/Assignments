Abstract    :
              This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface  Chemistry
              Program, is focussed on electrochemical and  photoelectrochemical processes at
              semiconductors.  During the  tenure of this three-year continuing grant,
              Professor Bard and his  students at the University of Texas at Austin will
              pursue a broad  experimental program having four primary thrusts: (1) 
              investigations od semiconductor/liquid interfaces using scanning  probe
              microscopies; (2) studies of semiconductor nanoparticles,  known as
              "Q-particles," and thin films of Q-particles on conducting  substrates; (3) the
              identification and evaluation of new materials  and the modification of
              titanium dioxide as more efficient  photocatalysts; and (4) fundamental
              investigations of mechanisms of  electrode processes at insulators modeled by
              conducting electrodes  covered with insulating thin films.  This research,
              which builds  upon results obtained under the aegis of NSF grant CHE-9119851, 
              seeks to provide a better understanding of the semiconductor/liquid  interface
              and to improve the efficiency of technologically  important semiconductor
              photoprocesses.    Photoelectrochemistry at semiconductor surfaces is vital to
              the  effective utilization of solar energy in applications such as the 
              production of useful chemicals or the destruction of chemical  wastes.  This
              research is aimed at improving our understanding of  both dark and
              photoprocesses at semiconductor/liquid interfaces and  the utilization of that
              knowledge in the improved design of  technoloeically important
              photoelectrochemical systems and devices.
