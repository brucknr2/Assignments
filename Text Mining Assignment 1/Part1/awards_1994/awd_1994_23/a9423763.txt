Abstract    :
              This project will provide a new, comprehensive political data base for studying
              the formative years of the American democratic experiment, 1788-1824.  During
              this period voter turnout underwent the greatest increase in American history
              expanding from less than one third of the adult white males to more than half,
              and in some states three fourths, of all adult white male inhabitants.    The
              data base will consist of machine readable county-level data for the southern
              and western states and town-level data for New England and some Middle Atlantic
              states.  Both candidate name and party name indices will be developed for all
              major races.  The project will generate turnout figures as well as the degree
              of competition and consistency of party voting across all major political
              offices.  These election statistics will be linked to available census data to
              provide a better understanding of early national party cleavages.
