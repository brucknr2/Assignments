              1995  Abstract for NGA proposal #LPA-9423054 --  Creating a Science and
              Technology Partnership   The National Governor s Association proposes to
              conduct case studies of the NSF State/University/Industry Cooperative Research
              Centers (S/UICRCs),  the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR), and  the
              Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs.  The case studies will
              document state/federal interaction in each program, identify problems or
              barriers encountered, and suggest changes in program design to address problem
              areas.  Regarding the S/UICRC program, all existing centers will be included in
              the study.  Interviews will be conducted with each S/UICRC director, the NSF
              program directors responsible for S/UICRCs and the appropriate state official. 
              The state official will be the member of NGA s Science and Technology Council
              of the States or their designee.  Officials from approximately 20 states will
              be interviewed with regard to the SBIR program, in addition to NSF staff with
              responsibilities for administering the SBIR and STTR programs.  A panel of
              state and federal policymakers , as well as outside experts, will then be
              invited to participate in a one day workshop to critique the case studies and
              to recommend program modification as needed.   NGA will submit a final report
              in the form of a  White Paper  summarizing the findings from the case studies
              and proposing specific actions that might be taken by NSF management and the
              nation s Governors to strengthen the partnership between NSF and state
              governments.                              ;
