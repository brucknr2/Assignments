Abstract    :
              9423294  Ziomek-Moroz    This research is a one-year study to increase current 
              understanding of the corrosion behavior of a new class  of advanced materials,
              titanium-based intermetallics  containing aluminum.  The corrosion behavior of 
              gamma  titanium aluminide, alpha-two titanium aluminide,  alpha-two/gamma
              titanium aluminide, and pure  constituent metals is examined  in aqueous
              solutions  of potassium nitrate, potassium sulfate, potassium  hydroxide,
              nitric acid and sulfuric acid.  Scanning  and timed electrochemical experiments
              are performed in  deaerated, non-deaerated, and oxygen-saturated  solutions to
              determine the effects of solution  aeration on corrosion behavior.  
              Microscopic  investigations are employed to characterize the  surface of the
              corroded intermetallics.   The  structural information will be correlated with
              the  observed electrochemical behavior.  This is the first  time such a study
              has been made on titanium aluminides  with controlled microstructures.  %%% 
              This grant contributes to the understanding of the  corrosion behavior of
              titanium-aluminide  intermetallics  with non-homogenous microstructures.  Gamma
              titanium-aluminide alloys offer great promise  for applications in the
              aerospace industry.  A  practical output of these investigations will be 
              information applicable to the development of  electrochemical  machining
              techniques for titanium  aluminide.  ***
