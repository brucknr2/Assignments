Abstract    :
              This project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, 
              continues to advance applications in microelectrode technology. Owing to their 
              small size and proportionately small time constant, high speed voltammetric 
              responses can be generated at these electrodes for minute amounts of analyte at
               nanosecond time scales. In addition, coupling the detection of
              electrochemically  stimulated light emission at microelectrode arrays has given
              rise to a novel high  flux chemiluminescent probe of surface processes. During
              the tenure of this thirty-  two month continuing grant, Professor Mark Wightman
              and his students at the  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill will use
              micro- and nanovoltammetric  electrodes to prepare ultratrace-sensitive
              chromatographic detectors, probe  processes associated with single molecule
              reactions, develop a novel source for  high resolution imaging of surfaces, and
              generate long-lived electrochemi-  luminescence radiation in a `solvent-less`
              medium.       Microvoltammetric electrodes are micron- to nanometer-sized
              electrodes  which can be used as detectors for trace amounts of analyte, and/or
              short lived  species. Professor Wightman and his students at the University of
              North Carolina  at Chapel Hill are advancing a new generation of these devices
              which can be  implanted in body tissue, inside single cells, and are capable of
              monitoring very  fast reaction processes. This technology will be applicable to
              measurements  conducted in the environmental, advanced manufacturing, and
              biotechnology fields.
