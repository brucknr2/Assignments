Abstract    :
              This grant provides funding for the acquisition of shipboard instrumentation in
              support of NSF-funded research.  The instruments will be used aboard small,
              coastal, non-UNOLS vessels, such as the R/V ARGO-MAINE, owned by U. of Maine,
              and R/V GULF CHALLENGER, owned by U. of New Hampshire.  Instrumentation
              requested includes a portable winch and a carousel water sampling system.  The
              equipment is requested for support of NSF-funded research and will enhance the
              scientific capability of the approx. 24 institutions that are part of the
              Regional Association for Research on the Gulf of Maine (RARGOM). Availability
              of the instruments will be advertised in the RARGOM quarterly newsletter.    ??
