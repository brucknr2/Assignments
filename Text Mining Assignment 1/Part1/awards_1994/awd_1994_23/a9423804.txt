              Scouten. The 11th Affinity Chromatography and Biological Recognition Symposium,
              May 25 31, 1995  will be held in San Antonio, Texas, on the carnpus of Trinity
              University. This award will cover travel and living expenses forfive to eight
              predominantly younger investigators (age 35 and under). The Conference will
              rebate that portion of the fee above the cost of room and meals. A special four
              hour session will be devoted to talks from younger investigators from around
              the world, including those from the USA delegation, whose abstracts are
              accepted for oral presentation. Poster sessions will be required of all NSF
              sponsored younger investigators. The younger investigators will be required to
              submit a manuscript on their work, which, after appropriate review, will be
              published in both the Journal for Molecular Recognition and a special
              Proceedings volume. %%%  Affinity chromatography is critical for the
              development and utilization of the many advances that have been made in such
              fields as recombinant DNA and other biotechnology techniques which are
              blossoming through research laboratories world w ide. In addition, it provides
              an excellent resource for studying the interaction between biomolecules in
              protein protein interactions and polymerization processes, and the
              determination of substrate binding mechanisms for various enzymes, to list only
              a few applications of affinity techniques. Most significantly, affinity
              chromatography is the chief method used in the final purification of many
              enzymes and proteins, many of which have significant agricultural and
              therapeutic importance. The techniques have developed exponentially over the
              past few years and are present in virtually every issue of any major
              biochemical journal. For the promise of biotechnology to be realized, protein
              and nucleic acid purification using affinity chromatography techniques needs to
              be further developed and honed to their finest extent.
