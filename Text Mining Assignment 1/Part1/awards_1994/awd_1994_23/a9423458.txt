Abstract    :
              This ethnographic dissertation research will advance understanding of how
              climate change is constructed and discussed as a problem.  It will yield
              insight into the competing scientific approaches, claims and social behaviors
              influencing the scientific and social debates, and help to provide a framework
              to help policy-makers interpret differing scientific positions.  The research 
              will analyze the extrascientific dimensions of the scientific debate about
              human-caused climate change.  Its aim is to place differences in expert
              positions regarding the likelihood and severity of this change into their
              social, cultural, and political contexts.  The central question is:  in what
              ways do scientific theories and discussions on climate change reflect
              differences in predispositions related to cultural, social, and professional
              backgrounds, affiliations, values, and belief-systems.  The focus is on climate
              modelers and their models; research subjects include modelers and scientists in
              related fields in the geosciences involved in the debate.  Research methods
              include standard interview and archival research, and participant observation. 
              The dissertation will analyze scientific theories and judgments for their
              divergent assumptions and approaches to scientific uncertainty.  Competing
              positions on climate change and climate modeling will be compared and placed
              into social perspective through inquiry into scientists' professional
              backgrounds; their characterizations of the current debate on climate change,
              its development, and the issues it involves; and the ways in which they explain
              their own positions on climate change and their scientific approach to studying
              it in contrast with competing positions and approaches.
