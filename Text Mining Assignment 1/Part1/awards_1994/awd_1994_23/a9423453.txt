Abstract    :
               This is a study of social stratification in China.  It will administer and
              analyze a survey of a large scale national probability sample in the People's
              Republic of China, consisting of both urban and rural adults, village leaders,
              intelligentsia, entrepreneurs, and administrators of organizations.  The aim of
              this research is (a) to better understand the system, of social stratification
              and mobility in China, particularly during the recent period of market
              transition, but also earlier periods in the Communist Era, particularly the
              Cultural Revolution; (b) to test specific theories about the effect of the
              market transition on the relative importance of political and economic assets;
              and (c) to compare China to Eastern Europe, where the investigators are also
              conducting research, to test various theories about the role of institutional
              arrangements in social mobility.      %%%     An important feature of this
              project will be the creation of a sizable research team of Chinese and
              U.S.-based researchers that will work together for several years on the
              analysis of data and writing of research reports, a research team that will
              overlap with and coordinate their work with a similarly-constituted research
              group from six countries in eastern Europe.  Thus the project goes a long way
              toward creation of a world-wide network of scientists conducting research on
              democratization and market transition.  The findings of the research will guide
              American policy makers in understanding the vast social and economic changes
              currently in progress in China, the most populous nation on earth and a vast
              market for American industry.
