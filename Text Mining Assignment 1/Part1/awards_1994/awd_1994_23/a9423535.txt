Abstract    :
              9423535  Sieracki    Researchers at the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences
              will   further develop imaging cytometry instrumentation for the automated 
              measurement of phytoplankton cells based on the analysis of digital  images
              produced by microscopy - in this case epifluorescence  microscopy.  Imaging
              cytometry has much potential for addressing  basic questions in biological
              oceanography through the automated  analysis of natural plankton populations. 
              Work will enhance  Bigelow's microscopic imaging system for more rapid analysis
              of  plankton samples and reduce the need for operator intervention.   The
              system will be improved through a combination of hardware and  software.  A
              computer-controlled, motorized stage and new dual or  triple-band optical
              filter sets will be added to their  epifluorescence microscope.  New techniques
              and algorithms will  also be developed for image acquisition and analysis.  And
              research  will be undertaken on automated cell classification from digital 
              image data by testing classification algorithms and by using neural  net
              techniques.  The project will facilitate the study of oceanic  plankton
              community trophic and size structures.
