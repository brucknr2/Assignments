Abstract    :
              The principal goal of this project is to design error control codes  for
              "byte-organized" systems using a new error control model.  In  a byte-organized
              system, the hardware is partitioned such that each  part produced a subset of
              hits in the output.  For example, a  memory may be organized as one byte per
              card.  In this case, each  card produces a byte in the memory word.  For such
              systems, a new  error control model called the bit/byte bounded model is being 
              developed.  Briefly, this model can be described using tow  parameters, say t
              and u.  The codes designed using the bit/byte  bounded model can tolerate up to
              t bit errors confined to a must u  bytes.  Unlike the existing approaches, the
              bit/byte bounded model  can interpolate between the traditional bit and 1 byte
              error  models.  Also, the proposed model can be used to reduce the number  of
              checkbits by trading a small amount of error control capability.
