Abstract    :
              A new research program in theoretical gravitational physics,  under the
              direction of Prof. Jorge Pullin will be initiated  under the CAREER program. 
              Prof. Pullin will undertake  theoretical and numerical studies in problems
              dealing with  the General Theory of Relativity at a classical and quantum 
              mechanical level.  The major focuses of the program include:  1)  The
              development of codes for the evolution of  spherically symmetric fields applied
              in conjunction with  perturbation theory to the study of critical behavior of 
              gravitational collapse and the problem of the collision of  two black holes. 
              2)  The development of the loop  representation for quantum general relativity
              emphasizing  the use of extended loops, which have potential to solve  several
              technical difficulties of the traditional loop  approach and to add insight
              into the classical canonical  theory underlying the loop representation.   
              This project also includes a series of activities in  education including uses
              of computers, recruitment of  minorities and a book destined to graduate
              students.
