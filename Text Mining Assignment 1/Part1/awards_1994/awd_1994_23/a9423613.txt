Abstract    :
              9423613  Pine         This proposal requests funds for Immaculata College to
              reconnect  its campus network at a much higher level to the Pennsylvania 
              regional mid-level network, PREPnet.  Immaculata College is  currently
              connected to PREPnet, but at a minimal level which dos  not adequately meet the
              needs of even the few faculty and  administrators who have a campus network
              connection.  Upgraded  access using a frame relay connection, a router, and a
              CSU/DSU  would immeasurably enhance the available resources for faculty and 
              staff research as well as facilitate improved information service  to student
              at Immaculata.    The benefits of this NSFNET connection include e-mail between
              local  and remote researchers and educators, file transfer capability and  the
              ability to use remote computer resources.  Also the college  will have the
              ability to investigate innovation in educational  resources and incorporate
              them into their curricula.
