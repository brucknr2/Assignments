Abstract    :
              SBR-9423102  Oliver Linton    One of the areas in which econometrics has made
              great advances during the last fifteen years is semi-parametric estimation. 
              These new classes of estimators are able to efficiently estimate the parameters
              of a wide array of non-linear models, such as tobit and probit models, with
              only very minimal information about such things as the error generation process
              or the functional form of any regression functions. One problem with these
              estimators is that first-order approximations to the asymptotic distributions
              of these estimators provide poor approximations to their sampling behavior for
              the sample sizes that are typical in applied economic research.  This research
              develops more accurate formulas for the asymptotic distribution of a wide class
              of parametric and semi-parametric estimators and test statistics.  There are
              three projects.    The first project continues the principals investigator's
              work on second-order approximations of the asymptotic distribution of
              semi-parametric models.  Computing these estimators  typically requires the
              selection of a smoothing parameter, called the bandwidth.  The new expansions
              developed under this grant provide bandwidth selection methods that are second
              order optimal.    The second project develops asymptotic expansions for
              estimator and test statistics of parametric ARCH time series models.  These new
              expansions are then used to provide bias and size correction procedures and to
              evaluate the magnitude of small sample effects in these complicated procedures.
               They also provide more accurate small sample approximations of the sampling
              distribution.    The third project investigates a new class of semiparametric
              models for duration data and derives their first-order asymptotic theory.
