Abstract    :
              9418018  Hixon      This award will support the participation of ten American
              marine   ecologists at a workshop entitled "The Recruitment and Population 
              Dynamics of Coral Reef Fishes" to be held near Townsville,  Queensland,
              Australia, July 10 through 14, 1995.  The American  organizer is Dr. Mark A.
              Hixon from the Department of Zoology at  Oregon State University.  The
              Australian principal organizer is  Dr. Geoffrey P. Jones from the Department of
              Marine Biology at  the James Cook University of North Queensland.    Both the
              United States and Australia have become increasingly  concerned about the
              health of their coral-reef resources.  Coral-reef fishes have become recognized
              as ideal model systems  for furthering insight into the dynamics of marine fish
               populations.  The idea that populations of coral-reef fishes   are recruitment
              limited by larval supply has become both popular  and increasingly
              controversial.  Researchers from both countries  have become polarized in their
              thinking about recruitment  limitation, resulting in a conceptual stalemate
              that seems to be  inhibiting scientific progress.  By bringing together top 
              investigators from both countries, including a selected few from  Canada,
              Japan, France and the United Kingdom, the workshop will  seek to begin the
              resolution of this controversy. Among the  topics to be considered are
              appropriate spatial scales for reef   fish studies, competition effects on
              survivorship, predation  and density-dependence, recruitment limitation, and
              the  management and conservation of reef fisheries.    Australian support for
              this workshop is provided by the  Australian Department of Industry, Science
              and Technology (DIST).
