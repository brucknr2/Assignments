Abstract    :
              9418153  This award supports a program aimed at providing research  experiences
              to a broad range of undergraduate students.  The  program sill allow for active
              participation by undergraduate  students in ongoing marine geologic research in
              Antarctica.   Students will be recruited from institutions across the United 
              States and will participate in a preparatory seminar on Antarctic  science
              prior to the field season.  This program will integrate  undergraduate
              participation with existing marine geology and  geophysics projects aboard
              either of the two United States  Antarctic Program research vessels, the RV
              Polar Duke and the RVIB  Nathaniel B. Palmer.  Research topics will be related
              to the  stratigraphy and/or evolution of the Antarctic continental margin, 
              topics of increasing importance to both Antarctic and global  geology. 
              Students will have a full year following their field  experience to conduct
              follow-up research via a senior thesis.  This  program is intended to provide
              better educational experiences to  promising undergraduate students and to
              stimulate those students to  pursue advanced degrees in geology and geophysics.
