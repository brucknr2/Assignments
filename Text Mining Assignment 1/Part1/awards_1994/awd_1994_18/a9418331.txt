Abstract    :
                9418331  Muscatine         One of the most intriguing, and enigmatic phenomena
              in  the field of coral reef ecology is the symbiotic  relationship between the
              coral polyp and the nutrient  producing dinoflagellate that it hosts.  This
              relationship  is the key feature in the stability of coral reefs and many  of
              the organisms which reside there.       The objective of this project is to
              study the  translocation of  carbon from symbiotic dinoflagellates to  the
              coral host cells.  This will be achieved by a  revolutionary approach to
              studying this relationship, by  artificially altering the biochemical carbon
              pathways, and  evaluating the subsequent metabolism of the coral polyp and  the
              photosynthetic  capacities of the dinoflagellates.  This  shall give us new
              insights on the nutritional relationship  between the two.       Dr. Muscatine
              has a string of success with prior NSF  awards and is at the forefront in this
              field of study.  His  project will help to achieve two objectives: 1) further 
              contribute to our understanding of the role of coral  symbioses, which could
              potentially have biotechnological  value, and 2) provide another opportunity
              for collaborative  work with Russian scientist in U.S. laboratories.
