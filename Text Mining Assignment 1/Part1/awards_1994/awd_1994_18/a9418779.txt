Abstract    :
              9418779  Zou       This award supports mathematical research on problems 
              arising in two areas of nonlinear partial differential equations.  The first is
              related to the analysis of the asymptotic behavior  and classification of
              positive solutions of semilinear equations  in n-dimensional space, focusing on
              the Lane-Emden equation. The  problem has been studied exhaustively in various
              special cases.    Extensions and generalizations of this work will also be
              carried  out.  Uniqueness of positive solutions, especially in the case of 
              radial solutions will also be taken up.  A new direction  of research concerns
              existence and non-existence questions  for semilinear systems such as the
              Fujita system.  More  applied studies will consider the thermistor problem, 
              analyzing electrical resistors whose resistance increases rapidly  with
              increasing temperature.  Finally, work will be done on  the existence problem
              for ground states for quasilinear elliptic  quations and the Dirichlet problem
              for the Monge-Amper Equation          Partial differential equations form a
              basis for mathematical  modeling of the physical world.  The role of
              mathematical  analysis is not so much to create the equations as it is to 
              provide qualitative and quantitative information about the  solutions.  This
              may include answers to questions about  uniqueness, smoothness and growth.  In
              addition, analysis often  develops methods for approximation of solutions and
              estimates on  the accuracy of these approximations.  ***
