Abstract    :
              9418681  Hesterberg       This project will locate and quantify deformation due 
              to past, relatively recent tectonic activity in areas of low  relief, such as
              the New Madrid seismic zone, which are often  located far from plate boundaries
              and may be overlain by  thousands of meters of sediments. Previous geomorphic 
              methods have had little success in the past; this project  will develop and
              test new methods that are based on the  observation that streams adjust their
              channels to external  change by incising, aggrading, or altering their
              sinuosity.  The method is a statistical one and relatively inexpensive.  It
              uses topographic maps rather than field work. The results  of this project will
              provide a useful reconnaisance tool for  any low relief continental area
              subject to large earthquakes  and will profoundly improve our understanding of
              active  tectonics in the cratonic regions of continents.
