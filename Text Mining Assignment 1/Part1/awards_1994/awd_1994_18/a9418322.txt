Abstract    :
              9418322  Harrison    This project is to conduct 40Ar/39Ar analyses of a suite of
              samples already collected from the  Zanskar shear zone in the Lhasa district of
              the central Himalayas in order to date the movement  on this fault. The Zanskar
              shear zone is part of a major low-angle normal fault system known  as the
              Southern Tibetan Detachment System that appears to span the entire length of
              the orogenic  collision front. The timing of this remarkable feature is poorly
              constrained in the Zanskar  region, although about 1000 km farther east the
              fault is known to have moved at 23-20 Ma.  The  project will measure 40Ar/39Ar
              on 16 separated minerals and determine detailed thermal histories,  timing of
              fault initiation and slip-rate history. The results will provide needed insight
              on the  origin and evolution of this extensional fault system and will help
              understand the tectonic  evolution of other major compressional orogenic
              systems.
