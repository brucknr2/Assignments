Abstract    :
              9418237  Hodges  The objectives of this study are to ascertain whether excess
              40-Ar is situated in fluid inclusions in silicates, to document the release
              characteristics of Ar from fluid inclusions using the various methods of gas
              extraction, and to evaluate if it is possible to obtain noble gas information
              from samples containing multiple types of fluid inclusions. 
              Well-characterized, hydrothermally treated samples will be used in the
              experiments.  A frequency-quadrupled Nd:YAG laser will be used for the laser
              microprobe studies of samples containing multiple types of fluid inclusions.
