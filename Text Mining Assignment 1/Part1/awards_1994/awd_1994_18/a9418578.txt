Abstract    :
              9418578  Van Schmus  This project will examine a diverse crustal xenolith suite 
              from the Navajo volcanic field in the Four Corners area of  the southwestern
              United States.  The research will include  field, petrographic, major and trace
              element, U/Pb zircon  dating, and thermobarometric studies.  Major objectives
              are  to determine the spatial, depth, and age relationships among  these
              xenoliths, and from these results, to better  understand the origin and
              evolution of the crust in this  region.
