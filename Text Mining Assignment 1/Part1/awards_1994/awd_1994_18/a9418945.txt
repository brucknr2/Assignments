Abstract    :
              9418945  Fei  The proposed research will determine phase relations  relevant to
              the 410-km and 670-km seismic discontinuities by  using complementary
              high-pressure techniques (high-  temperature diamond-anvil cell and multi-anvil
              apparatus).  The olivine-modified spinel and the spinel = perovskite + 
              magnesiowustite transitions in the system Mg2SiO4-Fe2SiO4  will be determined
              by in situ synchrotron x-ray measurements  with a high temperature diamond
              cell.  The slopes of the  transformations of spinel to perovskite plus
              magnesiowustite  and of ilmentie to perovskite will be precisely determined 
              with the high temperature diamond cell.  The compositional  effect of the
              alpha-beta transition pressure and width of  the two-phase region will be
              examined for the first time by  using high-resolution and high-efficiency
              multi-cell sample  chamber design in multi-anvil apparatus.  The expected 
              results will be used to evaluate the nature of the two  discontinuities,whether
              the sharpness of the 410-km  discontinuity is consistent with the width of the
              two phase  region, and whether whole mantle convection can occur based  on the
              slope of the transitions related to the 670-km  discontinuity.
