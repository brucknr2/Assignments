Abstract    :
              9418709     Barmish  This is a proposal to set up a joint three year research
              project  under the NSF Program of U.S. Russian Cooperation in the Field of 
              Basic Scientific Research.  The Russian and U.S. research teams  will each
              consist of mainly junior researchers, postdoctoral  associates and graduate
              students.  A critical component of the  project will be research visits to both
              the U.S. and Russia.  On  the U.S. side, the coordination of activities will be
              carried out  by Professor B. Ross Barmish; on the Russian side, the same 
              function will be carried out by Professor Boris T. Polyak.  The  body of this
              proposal provides all the details motivating the  basis and implementation of
              this collaboration an describes a  number of promising research directions in
              the field of robust  control.  For the class of parametric uncertainty problems
              under  consideration, it is argued that these research directions are 
              particularly well-suited to gain maximal advantage associated  with the
              combination of American and Russian expertise.  ***
