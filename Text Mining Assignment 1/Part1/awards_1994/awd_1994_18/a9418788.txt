Abstract    :
              9418788  Chisholm-Brause  The proposed study is designed to examine the effects
              of iron substituted into oxides and clays on metal-ion sorption.  The goal is
              to elucidate the effects of structural iron over a broad range of solution
              conditions.  By varying the solution conditions for metal-ion uptake, this
              research will examine the effect of iron substitution in minerals for various
              sorption processes, such as adsorption to distinct amphoteric surface sites,
              exchange at the basal planes of clay particles, and formation of multinuclear
              sorption complexes.  the proposed research will employ a combination of
              wet-chemical experiments, designed to examine macroscopic sorption behavior,
              and spectroscopic methods which are molecular level probes of the sorption
              complex.  This research will focus on use of synchrotron-based x-ray absorption
              spectroscopy (XAS).
