Abstract    :
              9418215  Drake   This award provides partial (52%) funding for the acquisition
              of components needed to assemble a multi-anvil high-pressure system that will
              be installed in the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory at the University of
              Arizona. The University is committed to providing the remaining funds required
              for the acquisition. The apparatus is designed to sustain experimental sample
              pressures up to 250 kilobars with simultaneous temperatures up to 3000K.
              Research applications of the equipment will include controlled experiments to
              measure the partitioning of trace elements between liquid and crystalline
              phases thought to be present during the early formation history of the Earth
              and other planets.  ***
