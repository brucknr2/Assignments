Abstract    :
              9418074  Sucher  Macomb Community College requests support from NSF for
              connection  of its campus network to NSFNET.  MERIT is the midlevel network 
              located in the state of Michigan that will provide operations and  network
              information services.  It will give Macomb Community  College a 56 thousand
              bits per second connection to the NSFNET, a  high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits
              per second) National Backbone  network.    The college needs greater
              functionality and network speed to be  able to access supercomputers,
              libraries, and make file transfers  along with being able to implement a more
              reliable mail system.   Students and faculty research will benefit from the
              link.  This is  also a unique opportunity for the school to explore innovative 
              educational resources.
