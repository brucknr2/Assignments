Abstract    :
              9418762  Segall    This Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC)
              is  being funded as a multi-site research Center.  Purdue University  and the
              University of Florida is adding the University of Oregon  (including Oregon
              State University, the Oregon Graduate Institute  of Science & Technology and
              Portland State University) as research  sites in the I/UCRC for Software
              Engineering (SERC).  Seven  companies will join serc inconjunction with the
              University of  Oregon becoming an additional research site in the Center.   
              The Center's research agenda will be increased by research projects  on "Time
              Insensitive Binary to Binary Translation; "Entropy-Based  Measure of Software
              Complexity and Its Application to Software  Testing", "Visual Programming
              Languages", "Human Computer  Interaction", and "Software Engineering Tools for
              the Construction  of Network Applications."    The researchers of involved with
              the Center are qualified to  perform the research projects.    The Center has
              been coordinated with Dr. Bruce Barnes, Program  Director of the Computer
              Computation Research Program at NSF.      The Program Manager recommends the
              University of Oregon be awarded  $50,000 for the first year of a five year
              continuing award.    Near the end of each 12-month period, the Program Manager
              and/or  the Division Director of the Engineering Education Centers Division 
              will review the progress of the Center on a number of renewal  criteria,
              including the following:  1) the extent to which the  industry/university
              interaction is developing; 2) the extent to  which the support base is
              developing; and 3) the extent to which a  robust research program is
              developing.  If the review is  satisfactory, the Program Manager will
              recommends support for the  next period of this continuing award.
