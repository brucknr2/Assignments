Abstract    :
              9418905  Jirsa  The objective of this project is to mobilize an effort  leading
              to and in support of a new generation of structural  design codes.  A panel of
              specialists in earthquake design  and research will be assembled to outline the
              actions that  will be needed to produce and implement a new generation of 
              codes.  This planning effort will be undertaken in concert  with the other
              National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program  (NEHRP) agencies.  The product of
              the planning activity will  be to develop a framework of a new code and a
              strategy for  acquiring the technical information that will be needed to 
              formulate a new code and for its implementation through  education and
              retraining of the engineering community.  ***
