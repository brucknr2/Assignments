Abstract    :
              9418206  Fink   This award provides funding for fundamental studies of minerals
              employing electron energy-loss spectroscopic techniques. The general goal of
              the spectrometric studies is to gain an understanding of  the bonding and
              oxidation state of iron in minerals and of the bonding and structure of
              crystalline and opaline silica polymorphs . One important specific objective of
              the studies is to determine the feasibility of using electron energy-loss
              spectroscopy to measure the ratio of Fe2+ to Fe3+ in silicates with a spatial
              resolution of nanometers in a scanning transmission  electron microscope fitted
              with a special electron detector. Determination of iron oxidation states at the
              nanometer scale is not now possible but would be an important step in
              understanding the chemistry of minerals and in reconstructing the geological
              conditions of their formation.  ***
