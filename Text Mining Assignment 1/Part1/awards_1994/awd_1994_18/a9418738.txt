Abstract    :
              9418738  Haimson         The KTB project, located in southeastern Germany, is
              the  world's deepest scientific drilling project outside the former  Soviet
              Union (TD 9.1km).  This is a joint project between the  University of Wisconsin
              and Stanford University and represents a  continuation of a cooperative
              US/German research project to  determine stress magnitude and orientation as a
              function of depth  in the KTB borehole through implementation of an integrated
              stress  measurement strategy, relying heavily on evaluation of compressive  and
              tensile failures observed in the borehole.  To date, this work  has been quite
              successful but an important weakness in this effort  has been the lack of
              sufficient data on rock strength.  The purpose  of the this project is to fill
              this critical gap and thus greatly  improve our ability to constrain stress
              magnitudes at depth.         Specifically, the principal objective of the
              research is to  comprehensively investigate the strength of core samples from
              the  KTB ultra-deep borehole under a variety of stress conditions:  tensile,
              uniaxial, compressive, triaxial compressive, and in  particular true polyaxial.
               Comprehensive polyaxial compressive  strength tests will be conducted in a
              newly designed cell that  minimizes friction at the faces of prismatic rock
              specimens.  The  results of these studies will be used to improve the
              reliability of  estimates of the maximum horizontal principal in situ stress in
              the  KTB hole.  ***
