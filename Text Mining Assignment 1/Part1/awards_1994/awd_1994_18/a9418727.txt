Abstract    :
              9418727  Chen           The compositional effect and the simultaneous pressure
              and  temperature effects on the elasticity of pyrope-almandine-grossular 
              solution series will be studied experimentally, at pressures to  ~500 Mpa and
              temperatures to 1000K, i.e. to above the Debye  temperature of garnet.  Garnets
              are considered to be among the most  abundant minerals in the upper mantle. 
              Measurements will made by  using the Coherent Gigahertz Ultrasonic (CGU)
              interferometer   recently developed.  Both P- and S-wave travel times will be 
              measured.  ***
