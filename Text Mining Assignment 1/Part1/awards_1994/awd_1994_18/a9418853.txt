Abstract    :
              9418853   Harper    This award will support the participation of ten
              U.S.scientists  to take part in a seminar concerned with preliminary site 
              selection for an international astronomical observatory to  be located on the
              Antarctic Plateau.  The seminar will be held   at the Mount Stromlo Observatory
              in Canberra, Australia in  February 1995.  The American coordinator is Prof.
              Doyal Harper  from the University of Chicago and director of the Center for 
              Astrophysical Research in Antarctica.  The Australian organizer  is Dr. Jeremy
              Mould of the Australian National University and  director of the Mount Stromlo
              and Siding Spring Observatories.  The seminar is being conducted under the
              U.S.-Australia  Cooperative Science  Program and support in Australia is
              provided  through the Department of Industry, Science and Technology  (DIST).  
               Nowhere else on Earth are conditions for astronomical observation  as close to
              ideal as they are above the Antarctic Plateau.  Observations from Antarctica
              can open windows on the Universe  normally closed to any but space-based
              missions. An astronomical  observatory capable of exploiting these natural
              conditions will  generate exciting new discoveries about the formation epoch of
               galaxies, provide data on the physics of black holes, permit the  detection of
              photoplanetary systems and provide key data in  support of a host of other
              studies. The seminar will be a timely  opportunity to compare recent results,
              evaluate scientific  opportunities, and devise a rationalized international
              plan for  astronomical site testing in preparation for establishing a 
              first-class observatory in the Antarctic.
