Abstract    :
              9418062  Hodges   This project will conduct mapping and geochronological studies
              of the Annapurna Range in central Nepal, where the processes of coeval
              shortening and extension occur within a convergent plate boundary setting. The
              extensional and strike slip faults are thought to work along with erosion to 
              compensate  for the extreme topographic gradients that would be produced by
              crustal shortening alone. Previous work has shown that there are miultiple
              generations of shortening and extesional structures in the Annapurna Range.
              This project will provide a reliable map of these structures, and obtain
              precise ages and pressure/temperature histories of the movement episodes. The
              results will give a better understanding of the relationship between thermal
              and tectonic processes in dynamically compensated orogenic regions, and will be
              applicable to orogenic belts worldwide.
