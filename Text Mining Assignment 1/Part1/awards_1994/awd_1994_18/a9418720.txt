Abstract    :
              9418720  Bohrson  This is a two year project to document U-Th disequilibria 
              characteristics of pumice glass and minerals from two  compositionally zoned
              pyroclastic deposits from the  Phlegrean Fields, Italy:  the Campanian
              Ignimbrite and the  Neopolitan Yellow Tuff.  High-precision thermal ionization 
              mass spectrometry will be used to document the 230Th/232Th  characteristics and
              U and Th concentrations (by isotope  dilution) of pumice glass that represents
              the compositional  ranges of the deposits.  In addition, phenocrysts (feldspar,
               magnetite) from selected pumice will also be characterized.  These data will
              be used to document processes and timescales  associated with the generation of
              zoned crustal magma bodies  using geochemical and fluid dynamical modeling.  In
               addition, the integration of geochemical and fluid dynamical  modeling
              represents a potentially powerful approach for  understanding the development
              of chemical gradients in  crustal magma bodies.
