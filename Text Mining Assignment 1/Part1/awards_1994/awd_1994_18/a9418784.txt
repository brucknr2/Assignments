Abstract    :
              9418784  Wernicke         This is a project involving the installation and
              monitoring of  a continuous GPS network across the Basin and Range.  The 
              scientific goal is to determine whether the geodetically determined  strain is
              concentrated within bands of historically high seismic  moment release,
              consistent with the elastic rebound theory, or is  spread out in a more diffuse
              manner.  Until now, both land- and  space- based geodetic techniques have had
              limited success in  resolving heterogeneity in intraplate strain accumulation,
              because  the slip rates along intraplate fault zones are usually at or below 
              the level of resolution for conventional GPS or land-based surveys,  or about
              1mm/yr.  However, with the technique of continuous GPS  monitoring, rates of
              1mm/yr are resolvable in less than five years.   With appropriate network
              design, a high-resolution kinematic image  of an entire diffuse orogen is now
              within reach.  ***
