Abstract    :
              9418889  Kurz  Preliminary data from the Galapagos demonstrate the  importance
              of helium to understanding mantle processes.  Although the high 3He/4He ratios
              alone are important, the  focus of this project is to understand the local
              variations,  and relate them to processes within the plume.  A  particularly
              important aspect of the proposed work is that  cosmic ray produced  3He can be
              used to determine ages, thus  providing age control.  This will be an
              integrated approach  that will combine field work, major and trace element 
              measurements, and the isotopes of He, Sr, Nd and Pb, with  chronology provided
              by surface exposure dating.  This work  will be carried out in collaboration
              with Dennis Geist  (University of Idaho) who has a long record of field work in
               the Galapagos.  The goals of the proposed research are to:  1.  Evaluate the
              temporal evolution of Galapagos hotspot,  and individual volcanic centers using
              surface exposure  dating.  By obtaining the geochemical data in conjunction 
              with chronology to rigorously test the various models for  the overall
              gradients within the archipelago it should be  possible.  2.  Document the
              helium isotopic variability  within the archipelago.
