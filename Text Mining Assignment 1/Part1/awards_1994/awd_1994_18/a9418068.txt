Abstract    :
              9418068  DeFanti  This Metacenter Regional Alliance will tie together three
              complementary organizations: the Metacenter, the Software Technologies Research
              Center (STRC) at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), and the Chicago
              Manufacturing Center (CMC). The organizing principle is the provision of a
              high-end testbed for virtual reality applied to manufacturing product design
              and rapid prototyping, to both large companies and consortia of small ones.    
              The proposal will create and transfer the technology of virtual reality within
              the National Information Infrastructure.  The software and advanced human
              interface technology for remote virtual prototyping and its supercomputing
              support will be developed with regional metacenter partners and small
              businesses.  The proposed link to the vBNS is a vital part of this proposal.   
              The STRC has demonstrated over a twenty year history that it can apply
              visualization technology to many areas, e.g., education, manufacturing, and
              training.  It has provided the expertise that culminated in the CAVE virtual
              reality theater at the SIGGRAPH and Supercomputing conferences.  CMC manages
              one of the newest NIST regional manufacturing Centers whose aim is to assist
              small and medium sized businesses modernize operations and improve
              competitiveness.     Through its partnership with STRC, CMC, and NCSA this
              Alliance has the opportunity to provide leadership in areas of HPCC technology
              deployment to the Chicago region, and create a paradigm that can be replicated
              by other urban research institutions.
