Abstract    :
                    ABSTRACT  CTS-9418973  Morteza Gharib       Detailed measurements of
              three-dimensional velocity, vorticity, and temperature fields in the wake
              behind a circular cylinder will be carried out using novel high-resolution
              techniques; these measurements will be related to the mean global properties of
              the cylinder (heat transfer coefficient, for example); and provide information
              for comparison with numerical models of flow and heat transfer in the same
              geometry being performed concurrently by another investigator. The comparison
              will provide needed validation (or invalidation) of the accuracy of
              contemporary numerical predictive techniques.
