Abstract    :
              Abstract  This award supports two principal investigations that  utilize the
              recently completed Antarctic Marine Geological  and Geophysical synthesis and
              the associated digital  bathymetric, sediment thickness, and crustal structure
              data  files.  These, used along with published digital crustal age  data and
              spreading rate data for the circum-polar region  will allow development of
              paleographic reconstructions,  complete with paleobathymetry for a variety of
              geologic  times from the mid-Cretaceous to the present. The crustal  age and
              spreading rate data files are needed both to unload  the sediments and
              reposition the depths to account for the  effects of accrued crustal subsidence
              due to cooling and  isostasy.  An important benefit of determining the most 
              plausible paleobathymetry will be to arm circulation and  climate modellers
              with constraints necessary to refine their  models and to further evaluate the
              sensitivity of such  models to submarine morphological barriers and changing 
              basin sizes.  The second proposed application of the digital  age and spreading
              rate files is to test hypotheses that  selected oceanic crustal parameters of
              layer velocities and  thicknesses, as well as small-scale seafloor roughness,
              are  age and/or spreading rate dependent.  Establishing such  relationships is
              likely to lead to new discoveries about the  underlying casual processes
              effecting crustal evolution.  The Southern Ocean Marine Geological and
              Geophysical Atlas  and other digital data provide an excellent opportunity to 
              test such hypotheses for a significantly large fraction of  the World Ocean.
