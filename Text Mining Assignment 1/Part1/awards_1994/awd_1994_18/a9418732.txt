Abstract    :
              9418732  Stacey    This award supports the participation of six U.S. scientists
              in a U.S.-  Japan seminar on Molecular, Physiological, and Ecological Aspects 
              of Symbiotic Nitrogen Fixation, to be held at Kagoshima University,  Kagoshima,
              Japan in October 1995.  The co-organizers are Dr. Gary  Stacey of the
              University of Tennessee and Dr. Shiro Higashi of  Kagoshima University  Both
              the U.S. and Japan are supporting major  efforts in symbiotic nitrogen fixation
              and interaction between the  research groups of both countries will accelerate
              progress.  The  seminar topic areas encompass both the plant host and bacterial
               counterpart in the symbiotic nitrogen fixing interaction, as well as  topics
              ranging from enzymology, molecular genetics, plant cell  biology, whole plant
              physiology, ecology, and ultimately to plant  genetics and crop production.   
              This meeting is the third in a series of U.S.-Japan seminars in this  field
              held over a period of 10 years.  Although a core of individuals  has provided
              continuity from meeting to meeting, participants in the  seminars have changed
              through the years to reflect an appropriate  pairing between U.S. and Japanese
              participants and the progress of the  research.  The U.S. participants provide
              a broad cross section of  expertise and geographical representation in the
              overall area of  symbiotic nitrogen fixation, and were selected on the basis of
              being  the most active researchers in the U.S.  Therefore, this proposal 
              fulfills the objectives of the Program in its exchange and transfer of 
              scientific knowledge through an international collaboration.  ***
