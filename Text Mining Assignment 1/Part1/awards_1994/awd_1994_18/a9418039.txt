Abstract    :
              Rothman  9418039  This project is for research on the physics of complex
              geophysical flows, with emphasis on scale-dependent aspects of multiphase
              flows.  The research is primarily computational, and the principal
              computational tools are the lattice-gas and lattice-Boltzmann methods.  These
              methods provide special capabilities for the study of flows with complex
              interfaces or flows through complex geometries.  The present project emphasizes
              the application of lattice-gas and lattice-Boltzmann models to studies of real,
              three-dimensional, complex flows.  ****
