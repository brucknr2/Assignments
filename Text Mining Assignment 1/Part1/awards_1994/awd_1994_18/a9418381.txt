Abstract    :
              This award is for support for a two year project to study  subtemperate basal
              processes at Meserve Glacier in the  McMurdo Dry Valleys.  The basal layer at
              Meserve Glacier has  a distinctive amber color and is silt-rich.  The origin
              and  properties of distinctive layers often observed at the base  of
              sub-temperate ice masses are not well understood.  Most  mechanisms for
              entrainment require melting or at least  partial melting at the bed, and it is
              not clear how the  layer properties could evolve under present conditions.  A 
              specific goal of this study is to determine whether the  basal layer at Meserve
              Glacier could have formed at sub  freezing temperature, or whether its
              existence implies past  basal conditions were significantly warmer than today.
