Abstract    :
              9418922  Zeng      This research is to do an inverse study for several
              earthquake sources using a composite source modeling approach.  A suite of
              composite subevents is first generated and then a genetic algorithm is used to
              locate these subevents on the fault plane that best matches the observed strong
              motion waveforms.  Also, equivalent earthquake slip and dynamic stress drop
              models will be generated from the composite source solutions.  The results will
              help to better understand the earthquake dynamics and answer questions in
              regard to the characteristics of a dynamic source model imposed by the
              kinematic description of a composite source solution.  Advantages of this
              approach are that it provides a broadband description of earthquake source and
              wave propagation and that it has all the important phases of seismic waves.  It
              can be used to estimate the seismic hazard from a specific set of mapped
              faults.  This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard
              Reduction Program.  ***  ??
