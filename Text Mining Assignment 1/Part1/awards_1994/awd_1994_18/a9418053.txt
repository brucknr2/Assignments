Abstract    :
              9418053  Bloomfield  DNA functions in crowded, strongly interacting solutions. 
              The  equilibrium and dynamic aspects of its behavior are strongly  influenced
              by its environment.  When the volume occupancy of a  solution reaches several
              tens of percent, as it does within cells,  simple extrapolations from dilute
              solution behavior become totally  inadequate.  Experimental and theoretical
              approaches will be  applied to study the ways in which high polymer
              concentrations  influence the diffusion of DNA, and of proteins which bind to
              DNA.   Fluorescence photo bleaching recovery will be used as a major 
              experimental technique, and modern polymer theoretical concepts and  computer
              simulation as theoretical tools.  %%%  The goal in this project is to develop a
              solid experimental and  theoretical understanding of the ways in which high
              polymer  concentrations influence the diffusion of DNA, and of proteins  which
              bind to DNA.  This should shed light on some important  questions in cell
              biology, such as the segregation of plasmids  during cell division in
              microorganisms, and the location by binding  proteins of their specific binding
              sites in a background of  nonspecific DNA.  ***
