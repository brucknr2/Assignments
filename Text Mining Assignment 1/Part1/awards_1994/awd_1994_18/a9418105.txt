Abstract    :
              9418105  Carmichael  A series of experiments that will produce a compact
              expression relating intensive variables to the composition and stability of
              biotite in natural liquids are planned.  The experiments will determine (1) the
              iron redox equilibrium of the hydrous mineral biotite as a function of liquid
              composition, temperature and oxygen fugacity, (2) the conditions for biotite
              appearing as an early crystallizing phase in natural liquids, and (3) the
              solubility of water in natural silicate liquids from 0.5 to 2.5 kbars.
