Abstract    :
              9418530  Henyey         This project involves a comprehensive, 4-year multiphase
               crustal-scale study of the Southern Alpine orogen across the  central South
              Island of New Zealand, extending out to sea on either  side of the island.  The
              study is composed of two major transects -  a northern primary transect along
              the Rangitata River which will  have a full experimental effort at high
              resolution and a southern  transect which will be run on a gross-crustal scale.
               A diversity  of seismic work is the essence of the proposed study.  The unique
               configuration of the Southern Alps Orogen - a relatively narrow  (160 km)
              strip of land with seas on either side - allows the  Principal Investigators to
              use several different, yet  complementary, seismic methods.  The project is
              divided into 5  phases:         o    Phase 1:  An onshore CDP (Common Depth
              Point) reflection            profile across the South Island along the primary 
                        transect;         o    Phase 2:  Refraction/wide angle reflection
              profiles            across the South Island on both transects;         o   
              Phase 3:  A passive seismology field program encompassing            both
              transects recording local, regional, and teleseismic            events;        
              o    Phase 4:  Ancillary studies of petrophysics, gravity, and           
              magnetotellurics across both transects;         o    Phase 5:  Regional
              synthesis and the development of final            geotectonic models.    ***
