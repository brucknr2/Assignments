Abstract    :
              9418360  Walsh  This starter grant award to San Diego State University will 
              support the research of Professor Patrick Walsh. The goal of  the research is
              the development of new chiral metal complexes  and their application as
              catalysts for organic synthesis.  Specifically, ligands based on
              sulfonamide-substituted chiral  diamines  will be prepared which will form
              tetrahedral helical  complexes when combined with Group IV metals. These
              strongly  acidic complexes will be tested as catalyts for carbon-carbon  bond
              formation activity in the Diels-Alder reaction, the  Claisen rearrangement and
              aldol condensations.    This study of asymmetric catalysis and molecular
              recognition  will lead to advances in chiral Lewis acid catalysis. The new 
              ligand complexes will be versatile and will be of general use  in organic
              synthesis.
