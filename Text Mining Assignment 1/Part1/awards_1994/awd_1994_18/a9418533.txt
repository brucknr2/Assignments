Abstract    :
              9418533  Rajala    The North Carolina State University Industry/University
              Cooperative  Research Center for Advanced Computing and Communication is 
              becoming a multi-university Center with the addition of a research  site at
              Duke University.  Four companies are becoming part of the  Center inconjunction
              with Duke University becoming a research site.    The research agenda of the
              new multi-site Center will address high-  speed networking, reliable and
              fault-tolerant systems, digital  communication systems, distributed systems,
              and algorithms and  digital image processing algorithms.    The researchers are
              well qualified to perform the Center's research  program.    The Center is
              being co-funded with Dr. Yechelzkel Zalcstein in the  Division of Computer and
              Computation Research.    The Program Manager recommends North Carolina State
              University be  awarded $55,000 for the first year of a five-year continuing
              award.   This includes $5,000 for an evaluator for the Center.  Funding for 
              the second year is to be at the same level amount.  Funding for  years three
              through five will be at $30,000 per year (including  $5,000 for an evaluator.) 
                Near the end of each 12-month period the Program Manager and/or the  Division
              Director of the Engineering Education Center Division will  review the progress
              of the Center on a number of renewal criteria  requirements, including the
              following:  1) the extent to which the  industry/university interaction is
              developing; 2) the extent to  which the support base is developing; and 3) the
              extent to which a  robust research program is developing.  If the review is 
              satisfactory, the Program Manager will recommend support for the  next period
              of this continuing award.
