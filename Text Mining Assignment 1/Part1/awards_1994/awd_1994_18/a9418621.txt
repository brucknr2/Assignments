Abstract    :
              Abstract  This award supports a project to test the recent hypothesis that
              Laurentia (the cratonic  part of present-day North America) was adjacent to the
              East Antarctic craton during late  Proterozoic time and was therefore a part of
              Gondwana.  The hypothesized geographic  disposition of these continental masses
              has far-reaching implications for the assembly,  evolution, and breakup of
              Gondwana.  This hypothesis, however, has not yet been  substantially tested. 
              If Laurentia did breakout of Gondwana from a position adjacent to  Antarctica,
              rift-related sediments should record this event and contain detritus, including
               detrital zircon, derived from the rifting continent.  Late Proterozoic
              metasedimentary  rocks exposed throughout the Transantarctic Mountains
              (including the La Gorce,  Duncan, Goldie, and Cobham Formations, and the
              Skelton and Koettlitz Groups) are  the most-likely candidates for such rocks. 
              This project will produce a geochronometric  inventory of detrital zircons from
              samples of these units distributed along the length of  the Transantarctic
              Mountains.  The geochronometric data will provide a useful test of  the
              hypothesis and will complement on-going detrital zircon studies of other
              Proterozoic  rocks in the Transantarctic Range.
