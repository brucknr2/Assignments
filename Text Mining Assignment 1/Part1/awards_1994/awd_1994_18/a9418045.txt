Abstract    :
              9418045  Anders       The velocity of the north American plate relative to the
              upper  mantle is poorly constrained relative to hotspot derived oceanic  plate
              velocities primarily because continental, hotspot-related  volcanism is very
              nonlinear.  This project attempts to utilize a  broad, more stable measure of
              the hotspot passage.  The work will  measure relative tilts of sediment
              deposited during active faulting  related to passage of the thermal welt across
              the continent rather  than the unpredictable volcanism.  Results have to
              potential to  provide an accurate measure of the velocity history of the North 
              American plate relative to the upper mantle and to provide a better  way to
              assess continental plate motions relative to the hotspot  framework generally.
