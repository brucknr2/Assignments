Abstract    :
              9418768  Chapman    This award supports a 12-month Japan Society for the
              Promotion of Science Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. Michael Chapman,
              Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of New Mexico, at the KEK
              National Laboratory for High Energy Physics, Tsukuba, Japan.  Dr. Chapman will
              work with Dr. Yoshitaka Kuno and Jun Imazato of the Department of Physics, on a
              research project entitled, "Japan JSPS Program:  Time Variance in the Decay of
              Neutral Kaons."  The research team will study the time reversal operation of
              the CPT theorem of symmetry operations.  In this general theorem C is the
              charge conjugation operation, P is the parity operation, and T is the time
              reversal operation.  Previous studies have shown that C and P change in the
              weak decays of neutral Kaons, however, to date no experiments have observed
              time variances.  Drs. Kuno and Imazato are experts in proton synchrotron
              experimentation and Dr. Chapman will work with them to search for a T violating
              signal of decaying Kaons.  ***
