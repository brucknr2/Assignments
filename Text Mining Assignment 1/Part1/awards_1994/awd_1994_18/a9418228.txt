Abstract    :
              9418228  Kelemen  The study of shallow mantle peridotite provides a window  into
              processes of melt extraction, melt transport, and  deformation.  Field studies
              of the relationship between  physical properties of the mantle and melt
              distribution  provide a critical link between constraints provided by 
              laboratory experiments, hand specimen geochemistry, and  large scale
              geophysical observations.  This is a field  investigation of textural, modal
              and compositional variation  in the shallow mantle sections of the Josephine
              and Trinity  ophiolites (SW Oregon and N California).  Determination of  grain
              size, grain size distribution, grain shape, and  crystallographic  fabric
              across igneous reaction zones in  the peridotite, in combination with detailed
              studies of  compositional variation, will provide constraints on the  melt/rock
              ratio, mechanisms of recrystallization during  localized deformation, and the
              nature of melt transport  through these zones.
