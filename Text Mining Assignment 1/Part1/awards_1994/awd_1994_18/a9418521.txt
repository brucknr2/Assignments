Abstract    :
              9418521  Duebendorfer       The assembly of cratons involves formation of
              crustal-scale  boundaries  as disparate crustal blocks collide and amalogmate. 
               Understanding of these boundaries in younger rocks is aided by  relatively
              shallow levels of exposure and relatively clear  lithologic and temporal
              differences.  However, aspects of  precambrian terrane boundaries remain
              problematic due in part to  deep levels of exposure and reliance an isotopic
              data for terrane  discrimination.  This collaborative project will employ a
              variety  of techniques and study one Precambrian boundary (Mojave and  Yavapai)
              in considerable detail, with the goal of formulating a  tectonic model for
              development of the zone that honors all geologic  constraints.  Results will
              lead to increased understanding of  crustal boundaries in deeply eroded ancient
              accreted terranes.
