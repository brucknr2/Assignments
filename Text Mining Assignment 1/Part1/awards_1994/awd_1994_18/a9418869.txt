Abstract    :
              9418869  Carter       This project will study the evolution of structures in
              salt  and salt/shale mixtures by means of 2D computer simulations.  
              Experimentally-derived rheological relations for the rocksalt and  shale will
              be used to analyses the effects of sedimentation rates,  differential loading
              and basement faulting on the genesis and  evolution of salt nappes,
              allochthonous sheets and salt diapirs.   Existing computer code will be
              modified to include a free surface  at the top of the model and multiple
              sedimentary layers.  The  results will be valuable in understanding the
              development of salt  structures on all scales and in a wide variety of tectonic
               situations.
