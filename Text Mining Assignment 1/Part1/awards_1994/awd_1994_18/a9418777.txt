Abstract    :
              9418777  Li   This award supports a 12-month Science and Technology Agency   of
              Japan Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. Li Li, Department   of Ocean Engineering,
              Massachusetts Institute of Technology,   at the Public Works Research
              Institute, Tsukuba, Japan.  Dr.   Li will work with Dr. Hiroshi Sato of the
              Structure Division   on a research project entitled, "Japan STA Program:   
              Structural Dynamics and Vibration Reduction of Long-Span   Bridges."  Through a
              combined experimental and analytical approach, Dr.   Li and Dr. Sato will
              develop a method and apparatus for   reducing the vibration of super-long-span
              bridges in high   winds.  During its lifespan, a super-long-span bridge is  
              constantly subjected to winds and vibrates primarily in its   torsional and
              bending modes.  Cross-flow vibration and in-  line fluctuating drag force are
              often close to natural   frequency, resulting in large dynamic responses and
              bridge   failure.  Utilizing a boundary vibration absorber developed   by Li,
              the team will develop a structural model for a super-  long-span bridge system
              to predict dynamic responses.  They   will use Dr. Sato s laboratory model of a
              long-span bridge   to validate the theoretical model and predictions.     ***
