Abstract    :
              Abstract  This award supports a study of the technical feasibility of 
              collecting and analyzing broad-band teleseismic data from the  Antarctic
              continental interior using portable seismometers.  The  West Antarctic Ice
              Sheet overlies a region of the Antarctic  continent which may be in extension. 
              However, very little is  actually known about the seismic structure of the
              crust and upper  mantle.  The deployment of portable broad-band seismometers
              for  passive teleseismic studies may offer the most effective means of 
              acquiring data on the deep structure of this continent.    Data collected with
              broad-band PASSCAL seismometers deployed as  an augmentation to the ICEQUAKE
              network in central West  Antarctica represents useful records with several well
              defined  teleseismic events (about 10-20 events) that were recorded over a 
              period of five weeks.  The data are of sufficient quality to  allow the
              estimation of fundamental mode dispersion curves down  to periods as low as 50
              seconds, and the analysis of body phases  for boundary interactions and travel
              time anomalies.  This should  provide first-order constraints on the shear
              velocity structure  of the crust and upper mantle down to a depth of
              approximately  200 km.  Additionally, the data contain sufficient information
              to  develop ambient noise models for ice sheets.  Consequently, if  successful,
              this work will lead to important guidance for the  technical design elements
              necessary for developing an important  experimental resource for seismic
              studies that may lead to  significant advances in understanding the Antarctic
              continent.
