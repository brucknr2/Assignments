Abstract    :
              94188002  Bose       Washington State University (WSU) will organize and host a 
              workshop on the infrastructure issues in electric power  engineering.  As the
              nation focuses on the civil infrastructure  systems (CIS), of which the power
              systems grid is a vital part,  the research issues for the various areas need
              to be clearly  defined.  This proposal is a plan to bring together about 40 of 
              the top power engineering experts for three days to develop a  blueprint for
              infrastructure research.       The NSF CIS Task Group report provides a
              conceptual  framework for infrastructure research by defining deterioration 
              science, assessment technologies, and renewal engineering.  A  special panel
              session at the 1994 Summer Power Meeting will shed  further light on specific
              infrastructure issues in power  engineering.  This workshop is to be a forum
              for experts to  continue this work and formulate specific research needs that
              can  be used by NSF and academic institutions to plan their R&D  efforts.  A
              conference record, including recommendations and  summarized discussions, will
              be produced for dissemination to a  wider audience.  ***
