Abstract    :
              9418772  Krim  The Nanometer Science and Technology Division (NSTD) of the
              American Vacuum Society (AVS) is hosting the NANO conference series which is
              aimed at providing a multidisciplinary forum focused on the science and
              technology that is apparent on the nanometer-length scale in fields such as
              biology, chemistry, electronics, engineering, fabrication, magnetics, material
              science, medicine, metrology, optics, optoelectronics, and physics.  Support
              provided will be utilized to partially defray the expenses incurred by students
              attending the NANO3 conference.  ***
