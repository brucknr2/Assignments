Abstract    :
              9418773  Blake     This project is part of the Southern Hemisphere Marine
              Aerosol Characterization Experiment (ACE-1), which will be conducted in the
              remote Southern Pacific in 1995 using aircraft, ship-board, and ground-based
              measurements of a wide variety of chemical species, physical  and
              meteorological parameters with the central goal of investigating the formation,
              evolution, and optical properties of atmospheric aerosol. In this component,
              whole air samples will be collected on-board the NCAR C-130 aircraft during
              most flights of the ACE-1 project. After the completion of each such flight,
              the samples will be shipped to the PI's home laboratory and assayed for about
              25 halocarbons and 40 non-methane hydrocarbons. A five column/six detector gas
              chromatography apparatus will be used for analyzing the samples.    The
              analysis of these whole air data will be useful for the interpretation of other
              measurements aboard the aircraft by providing information on the origin of the
              air encountered. The latitudinal profiles of halocarbons and hydrocarbons that
              will be obtained in the transit flights will provide useful information
              regarding source and sink distributions of different atmospheric gases.
              Vertical profiles for gases of different atmospheric lifetimes yield
              information on transport processes. These data will be useful for the
              atmospheric modeling community. Data taken during Southern Hemisphere vertical
              profiles over remote marine regions will be used for flux calculations,
              ultimately leading to source strength estimates for biogenic hydrocarbons and
              halocarbons.
