Abstract    :
                  9418425  Hillis and Crandall    This award will support the travel expenses
              for three months of  Dr. Keith A. Crandall to Australia.  Dr. Crandall, along
              with  Dr. David M. Hillis of the Department of Zoology at the  University of
              Texas, Austin, are conducting collaborative  research with Dr. Chris Austin of
              the School of Aquatic Science  and Natural Resource Management at Deakin
              University in  Warrnambool, Victoria, Australia.  The study will provide 
              information to assist in understanding the systematics and  evolutionary
              biology of a family of freshwater crayfishes.  The purpose of the travel is to
              collect a series of parastacid  crayfish in preparation for a
              morphological/molecular study of  their phylogeny.  Once the phylogeny has been
              developed it will  be used to test earlier hypotheses on phylogenetic
              relationships  and biogeography.  The study will also yield data that should be
               useful in conservation activities directed at these animals.  Dr. Austin
              brings to the collaboration his expertise on the  morphology of Australian
              crayfish and their geographic  distribution.  The American investigators have
              considerable  contributions in molecular systematic techniques.
