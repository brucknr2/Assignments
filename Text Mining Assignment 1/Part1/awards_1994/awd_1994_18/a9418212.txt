Abstract    :
              9418212  Osmond    Egypt is attempting to expand development in oasis areas in
              the Western Desert through enhanced utilization of ground water from the Nubian
              aquifer. This large aquifer has been characterized as a classic artesian
              system, with permeable sandstone water-bearing horizons only a few hundred
              meters beneath the shales and limestones at the surface.  Extensive pumping has
              lowered the potentiometric surface, and it is important to know to what extent
              the ground water is replenishable by recharge in the highlands to the
              southwest,  Light element isotopic studies have shown that some of the ground
              water reached the aquifer during periods of wetter climate such as may have
              occurred 8,000 years ago.  The pumping of this  ground water is non-renewable
              mining.     The use of U isotopes to determine water was developed at FSU and
              can be applied to the proportions of ground water  by source.  Field trips to
              the oasis areas and review of the available isotopic data confirmed the view
              that the Nubian aquifer is ideally suited for the analysis of mixing sources by
              uranium isotopic methods.    Approximately 120 five-liter samples will be
              collected from the six major oasis areas during four field trips over a
              two-year time span.  The field work and basic preliminary sample treatment
              steps will be done by Egyptian.  The isotopic measurements and data analyses
              will be conducted at FSU.  At least one Ain Shams graduate student will work as
              an exchange scholar at FSU.  Annual exchange visits by both FSU and Egyptian
              scientists are envisioned and will promote scientific research and graduate
              education at Ain Shams University as well as FSU.  Finally, the research will
              provide invaluable information for Egyptian hydrologists in the formulation of
              plans for utilization of the ground water resources in the Sahara desert.
