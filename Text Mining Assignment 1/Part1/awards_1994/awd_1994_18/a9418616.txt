Abstract    :
              9418616  Sharma  Recently an important contribution to the field of
              geomorphology has been the development of a nuclear method for quantifying
              erosion rates and exposure ages of geological surfaces.  the method relies on
              measurement of a number of radionuclides and stable nuclides which are
              continually being produced in situ in rocks exposed to cosmic rays.  We have
              chosen to examine 36Cl due to its ease of measurement and applicability to
              volcanic rocks.  We propose to calibrate the 36Cl method of exposure age dating
              up to   600 Ka.  The 36Cl and  40Ar/39Ar methods will then be applied to
              Central Andes volcanic rocks to provide a chronological framework for late
              Pleistocene to Holocene volcanism in the Central Andes.  The Central Andes has
              been selected for this pilot study because it is probably the finest example of
              continental volcanism in the world, and its high elevation and hyper-arid
              environment result in superb preservation (extremely low erosion rates) of
              volcanic features.  In addition, since a high incident flux of cosmic rays is
              attained at high altitudes, cosmogenic isotope production rates will also be
              high.  36Cl depth profiles, and, if possible, 36Cl/10Be ratios will be
              determined to ensure that the erosion rate is well below that which would
              affect exposure ages.  The proposed study will help to quantify several
              important scientific questions about central Andes volcanism:  (1) the rate of
              growth and evolution of volcanic constructs, (2) the eruption frequency of lava
              flows and magma production rates, and (3) the correlation of 36Cl exposure ages
              and erosion rates with Landsat imaging data.  The study is important as
              volcanism and tectonism are intimately related and any conclusions about the
              processes studied will likely be applicable globally.
