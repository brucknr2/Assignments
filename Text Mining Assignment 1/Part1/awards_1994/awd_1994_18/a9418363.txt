Abstract    :
              9418363  Jiles    This is a "TIE" project on the topic of "Assessment of
              Barkhausen  Effect Measurement for Evaluation of Ground Steel Components," to 
              be conducted by the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center  for
              Grinding at the University of Connecticut and Iowa State  University's 
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for  Non-Destructive
              Evaluation.    The proposed activity is to conduct research to  study and
              evaluate  the grinding damage to components by using the magnetic Barkhausen 
              effect measurements.   The Center for Grinding Research at the  University of
              Connecticut will be responsible for acquisition of  specimens, X-ray
              characterization and surface grinding.  The Center  for Nondestructive
              Evaluation at Iowa State University will be  responsible for performing the
              Barkhausen effect characterization  of the material, computer analysis of the
              signals from the  material, identification of relevant Barkhausen signal
              parameters  for evaluation of grinding damages, and correlation of results with
               X-ray diffraction data.    This project is being cost shared with the
              Industry/University  Cooperative Research Center for Grinding at the University
              of  Connecticut.    The Program Director recommends Iowa State University be
              awarded  $50,000 for 24 months to conduct a "TIE" project with the  University
              of Connecticut.
