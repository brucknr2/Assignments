Abstract    :
              9418560  Mattinson  The objective of the proposed research is a significant 
              refinement of the decay constants that are crucial to all U-  Pb geochronology.
               The proposed research will have a  geologic approach, which has two important
              advantages.  First, errors in the present decay constants and in the  thrid
              relevant constant, the isotopic composition of natural  U, can be evaluated
              together, as a single source of error.  Secondly, uncertainties in corrections
              for disequilibrium  effects in the U decay chains (230-Th and 231-Pa) can also 
              be evaluated.  A wide range of U-Pb studies will benefit  from the proposed
              work, especially calibration of the  geologic timescale, and studies where
              comparisons or  correlations are made with ages obtained by other high- 
              precision geochronology methods, such as 40-Ar/39-Ar.
