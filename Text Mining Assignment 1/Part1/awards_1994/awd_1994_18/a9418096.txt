Abstract    :
              9418096  Grover     Different species of organisms compete for the resources
              needed for growth.  Theoretically, such competition can lead to extinction of
              all species but the best competitor.  Algae and bacteria in freshwater habitats
              often compete for dissolved phosphorus, an essential nutrient, but are observed
              to coexist in most habitats, despite the superior competitive ability of
              bacteria.  The mechanisms that allow this coexistence are currently unknown,
              and this study will use laboratory investigations to explore them.  This will
              be done by growing algae and bacteria together under defined conditions,
              identifying the organisms that coexist, and determining their properties that
              allow coexistence.  Working hypotheses to be examined in these studies include
              (1) the possibility that lack of a sufficient supply of dissolved organic
              carbon, required by bacteria but not algae, limits the ability of bacteria to
              consume phosphorus, (2) the possibility that algae and bacteria specialize on
              chemically distinct forms of phosphorus, (3) the possibility that when
              phosphorus supply varies, algae are best able to store phosphorus acquired at
              elevated concentrations, while bacteria are best able to acquire phosphorus at
              low background concentrations, and (4) the possibility that protozoa eating
              bacteria, but not algae, limit the growth of bacteria, thus allowing algae to
              acquire phosphorus.     Excessive algal growth is a common water quality
              problem, and such excessive growth is often related to the phosphorus supply
              that a body of water receives.  Understanding the competitive balance between
              algae and bacteria in acquiring this phosphorus will help provide a scientific
              basis for management of water quality.
