Abstract    :
              Fowell  9418464     Climatic extremes have been suggested as the cause of high
              extinction rates among Late Triassic organisms, but the impact of warm global
              temperatures and climate change on the diversity of these fossil groups has not
              been examined in detail.  Analysis of palynofloral data from continuous cores
              and correlative outcrops of the Triassic Newark Supergroup is proposed in order
              to separate the effects of paleolatitude, precipitation gradients, and
              evolutionary changes on palynofloral composition.  The magnetic reversal
              stratigraphy and cyclostratigraphy of Newark basin cores provides a framework
              of rigorous temporal and geographic control for the Newark Supergroup and
              permits high-resolution correlation between separate but tectonically similar
              basins.  Collection and comparison of coeval palynofloras from four time slices
              in cores of the Newark and Taylorsville basins and outcrops of the Culpeper and
              Fundy basins is planned in order to reconstruct Late Triassic palynofloral
              diversity gradients across 7o of paleoaltitude from an equatorial humid belt to
              a sub-equatorial arid zone.  Species counts from these assemblages will be used
              to delineate Triassic vegetational communities, while similarity coefficients
              and polar ordination will be employed to determine how these communities
              changed over time and paleolatitude.  Isolation of the climatic/geographic and
              temporal aspects of floral composition and diversity will permit evaluation of
              the various climate-driven extinction scenarios and provide a useful test of
              Triassic climate models.
