Abstract    :
              9418833  Hayes  This project deals with the general question of the
              interpretation  of paleoceanographic information that is encoded in the organic
               debris of sea floor muds and sediment cores, that is, what is the 
              relationship between the sedimentary carbon and nitrogen isotopes  of organic
              molecules and contemporary oceanographic conditions.    Specifically the
              linkages among types of algae, conditions of their  growth, and the
              concentration of organic and inorganic nutrients  will be examined through the
              analysis of seawater and sediment  samples obtained from the Bellinghausen and
              Amundsen Seas in early  1994.  Particular emphasis will be placed on the
              relationship  between the Carbon-13 content of specific species of algae, and
              the  concentrations of nitrate, phosphate, and dissolved carbon dioxide  in the
              water column.  The seas surrounding Antarctica are important  in this context
              because of their presumptive importance in  regulating global climate patterns.
                 On the global scale, measurements of  sedimentary Carbon-13 are  made
              routinely in the context of biogeochemical cycling studies.   However the
              association of  Carbon-13 isotopic variability with  particular processes or
              phenomena that appear statistically valid  in one region are generally found
              not to be valid in others,  implying that small-scale relationships cannot
              simply be  generalized to large-scale relationships.  The advantage of 
              analyzing this particular data set lies in the fact that a large  body of
              ancillary information was obtained on the cruise, and  therefore the strong
              potential exists to tie together existing, but  less complete, data sets in
              addition to elucidating temperature  effects on underlying biochemical
              processes, and defining  specifically antarctic processes.  ***
