Abstract    :
              This project deals with the paleoclimate of the region that  extends from the
              Eastern Canadian  Arctic eastward to  Greenland and Iceland.  This is an area
              that is critical for  the integration of present and past records of climatic 
              change, especially within the context of the Arctic System  Science Program
              (ARCSS research agenda.  The main objectives  of the research will be to
              concentrate on the evaluation,  synthesis and interpetation of: i) instrumental
              records; ii)  historical data sources from Iceland; iii) the GISP2  isotopic
              time-series; iv) high-resolution marine series near  East Greenland; and v)
              annually laminated lake records from  Southeast Baffin Island and Iceland.  The
              project will  include an analysis of climate impact in Iceland in recent 
              centuries.  Thus, although focussing on paleoclimatic  reconstruction and
              interpretation, the research also has a  human dimensions perspective and links
               directly with the  needs of the new ARCSS Paleo initiative (Archeology and 
              Ethnohistory) regarding the documentation and understanding  of the role of
              climatic variations in the Norse expansion  throughout the North Atlantic, and
              human responses to the so-  called "Medieval Warm Period" and Little Ice Age". 
              In  conlcusion, the overall goal is directed towards improving  the
              understanding of annual to century timescale  fluctuations of climate in this
              region, as well as the  influences of such changes on Humankind.
