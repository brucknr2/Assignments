Abstract    :
              9418200  Goldstein       Whether or not large scale volume loss during slaty
              cleavage  formation is a long-standing and important problem.  Geometric  stain
              analysis commonly concludes large volume loss, while chemical  techniques
              generally find no evidence for such large losses, expect  over very short
              distances.  This project will use both approaches  to deduce the role of volume
              loss in the deformational history of  the Taconic slate belt.  A variety of
              strain indicators and fossils  are available, and the original composition of
              the shale may be  preserved adjacent to buttressing objects.  Results will be
              widely  applicable in deformation models, restoration algorithms and in  other
              slate terranes.
