Abstract    :
              9418803  Herbst    This project is concerned with the chemistry that occurs in 
              interstellar clouds and other cool astronomical objects.  Most of  the
              molecules are organic in nature although the most abundant  molecule is simple
              molecular hydrogen.  In addition to the gas  phase molecules, astronomers are
              also able to detect condensed  phase molecules that are located on mantles
              surrounding the cores  of dust particles.  Dr. Herbst will employ new and
              improved  chemical models for a variety of astronomical regions ranging from 
              interstellar clouds to circumstellar envelopes to planetary  nebulae.  The
              development of molecular complexity is one of several  problems that will be
              investigated because of the presence of  relatively large carbonaceous
              molecules.
