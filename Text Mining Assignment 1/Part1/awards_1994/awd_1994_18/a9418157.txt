Abstract    :
              9418157  Rutherford  This project continues experimental work directed at
              understanding conditions and magmatic processes in calc-alkaline magma systems.
               The overall objective of this research is to better understand the evolution
              of these magmas, and the controls on their degassing, mixing, emplacement in
              crustal magam chambers, and eruption.   These objectives will be achieved by
              determining crystal melt equilibria for assembalgges in equilibrium with a
              C-O-H- (+ S + Cl) fluid of fixed or measureable compositions.  Of equal
              interest are solubility measurements of the various C-O-H-S species in melts,
              and establishment of equations of state which describe changes in fluid phase
              fugacities with P, T, and composition.
