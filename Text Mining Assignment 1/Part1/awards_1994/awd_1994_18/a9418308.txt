Abstract    :
              9418308  McBridge  Gliding motility is a trait common to many unrelated
              bacteria, yet the mechanism(s) of gliding motility is(are) unknown.  The
              majority of molecular studies on bacterial gliding motility have focussed on
              Myxococcus xanthus since this is the only gliding bacterium with a well
              developed genetic system. Cytophaga johnsonae is not closely related to M.
              xanthus and has several advantages over M. xanthus as a model for gliding
              motility. C. johnsonae grows 2-3 times faster and glides 5 to 50 times faster
              than M. xanthus.  Until recently no genetic tools were available for C.
              johnsonae. Newly developed genetic tools are being used to analyze C. johnsonae
              gliding motility.  Techniques for gene transfer and transposon mutagenesis will
              be optimized.  Genes involved in the motility and tactic responses of C.
              johnsonae will be cloned in E. coli and sequenced.  DNA sequences will be
              analyzed to determine the nature of the motility machinery and of the signal
              transduction system that controls this machinery in response to environmental
              stimuli.  Putative genes will be mutated and reintroduced into C. johnsonae to
              determine the effect on motility or behavior.  %%%  In addition to expanding
              our knowledge of gliding motility, a common but little understood means of
              bacterial locomotion, these studies could have more practical value since
              cytophagas play important roles in biodegradation.  ***
