Abstract    :
              9418532  Kowalski    The Industry/University Cooperative Research for Process
              Analytical  Chemistry at the University of Washington studies mechanisms and 
              instruments for the control of chemical and biological processes.   The Center
              continues to meet the renewal criteria of the  Industry/University Cooperative
              Research Centers Program.    The reviewers were asked to review the Center
              under the criteria  for evaluation of I/UCRCs, as well as a specific research
              project  on an interdisciplinary effort to develop new methodologies for 
              monitoring and control of the processing and quality of emulsion 
              polymerization based on small angle x-ray scattering.    This award provides
              funding for one year under the "Self-Sufficient  Partnership for Research"
              Program to the University of Washington  I/UCRC for Process Analytical
              Chemistry.    Additional funding is provided by the U.S. Department of Energy's
               Battelle, Pacific Northwest Laboratory to augment ongoing research  and to
              obtain a membership in the Center.    The Program Manager recommends the
              University of Washington be  awarded $40,000 for one year.  An additional
              $35,000 is recommended  for one year with funds provided by the U.S. Department
              of Energy's  Battelle, Pacific Northwest Laboratory.
