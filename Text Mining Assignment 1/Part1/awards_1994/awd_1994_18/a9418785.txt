Abstract    :
                  Junying Yuan                          IBN #9418785      The overall
              objective of this ambitious project is the molecular characterization of the
              vertebrate programmed cell  death gene Ice-3, a homolog of the nematode C.
              elegans cell death gene ced-3 and mammalian cell death gene  interleukin 1-beta
              converting enzyme (ICE).  Naturally occurring cell death is an integral part of
              normal development  and homeostasis.  In the nematode C elegans, a genetic
              pathway of programmed cell death has been identified.   Genetic mosaic analysis
              showed the ced-3 is most likely acting within dying cells to cause cell death. 
              ICE is a  vertebrate homolog of ced-3.  Overexpression of ICE in mammalian
              fibroblasts causes cells to undergo programmed  cell death.  A family of
              vertebrate homologs of the C.elegans ced-3 gene has been identified by this
              laboratory.  Ice-  3 is one of the most interesting homologs because it appears
              to encode both an activator and an inhibitor of cell  death.  The mRNA of Ice-3
              is alternatively spliced into two different forms: Ice-3L, and Ice-3S.  When
              expressed  in Rat-1 cells, Ice-3L causes cells to die, while Ice-3S has the
              ability to prevent Rat-1 cell death induced by serum  deprivation.  A model is
              proposed in which ICE and ICE-3 act in parallel to control cell death.  This
              model will  be tested in a variety of experiments.  Biochemical and enzymatic
              properties of the ICE-3 protein will be studied  to reveal how ICE-3 acts to
              induce cell death.  The developmental pattern of Ice-3 expression will be
              examined.   Attempts will be made to isolate the activator, inhibitor and
              substrate of ICE-3 to identify upstream and downstream  elements of Ice-3. 
              Antibodies against ICE-3 will be generated and used to determine when and where
              the ICE-3  protein is made.  ICE-3 protein made by E. coli or baculovirus will
              be used to study the enzymatic properties of  ICE-3, with particular attention
              paid to the different potential roles of Ice-3L vs. Ice-3S. The yeast two
              hybrid  system will also be  used to isolate the genes that may encode proteins
              interacting with the ICE-3 protein.  Through  these studies, it is hoped to
              gain an understanding of the mechanism and function of Ice-3 in controlling
              programmed  cell death.  ***
