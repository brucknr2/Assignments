Abstract    :
              9418643  Lay      This research involves the use of broadband seismic data to
              address fundamental questions about earth structure and earthquake rupture
              processes.  The areas to be studied include short-period analysis of layering
              near subduction zones, deep slab energy focusing effects and associated slab
              structure, tectonic analysis of new aspherical global shear-wave models,
              development of unified seismic source models from body wave and surface wave
              data.  The results apply to convection in the mantle which is the driving force
              of plate tectonics, and to details of the generation of seismic waves in a
              multiple rupture earthquake process.  This research is a component of the
              National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.  ***  ??
