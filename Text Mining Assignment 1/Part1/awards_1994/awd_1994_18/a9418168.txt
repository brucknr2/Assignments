Abstract    :
              9418168  Mahoney  This project will  (1) continue successful geochemical work 
              related to the Deccan Traps of India, and (2) investigate  the origins of the
              vast but enigmatic Indian Ocean mantle  domain.  Recent models attribute the
              Deccan event to impact  of the Reunion plume head beneath a fast-moving Greater
               India; however, a study of alkalic intrusions north of the  Deccan by Basu et
              al.  1993  suggests that the Reunion  hotspot existed at least 3 m.y. before
              the main Deccan  eruptions.   Propose to analyze a collection of Parh basalts 
              for Nd, Pb, and Sr isotopes and ICP-MS trace elements, in  order to establish
              whether they are indeed early Reunion  hotspot products.  Recent investigations
              have shown that  modern Indian Ocean MORB, has a Pb-Nd-Sr isotopic signature 
              quite distinct from that of Pacific and North Atlantic MORB.  The earlier
              history of this immense mantle domain is  uncertain, however, and whether it
              originated and grew with  the breakup of Gondwana and the opening of the Indian
              Ocean,  or is an older feature inherited from the East Tethyan Ocean 
              asthenosphere is unknown.  Propose to analyze Pb, Nd, and Sr  isotopes trace
              elements and , where necessary, major  elements from DSDP sites in the western
              Indian Ocean, and  magmatic units of East Tethyan seafloor preserved in the 
              Masirah, Yarlung-Zangpo, and Baluchistan ophiolites in order  to answer this
              question.
