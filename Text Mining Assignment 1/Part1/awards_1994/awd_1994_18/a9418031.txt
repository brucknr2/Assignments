Abstract    :
              Heaney  9418031     The funds requested in this proposal will support Professor
              Peter J. Heaney of Princeton University and his research group in their
              investigations of microcrystalline silica  SiO2 .  This work will explore the
              ways in which silica microstructures reflect the chemistry of the environments
              in which they formed.  Although these kinds of investigations have been
              intensively pursued for biogenic marine silica, the structural characteristics
              of silica minerals from evaporitic environments remain relatively unknown.  Our
              ignorance of these phases is especially unfortunate, since evaporitic silica is
              an important paleoclimatic indicator and is commonly associated with economic
              ores.   By using transmission electron microscopy, powder X-ray diffraction,
              and electron probe microanalysis, Heaney and coworkers will determine the way
              in which evaporitic silica forms and transforms over time.  These studies will
              involve three interrelated projects:  1) Microstructural analysis of moganite,
              a newly recognized silica polymorph; 2) Determination of the crystal structure
              of the hydrous sodium silicate magadiite and the structural pathway between
              magadiite and moganite; and 3) Examination of replacement mechanisms between
              evaporitic silica and preexisting carbonate.  This work will establish a
              microstructural understanding of the diagenetic alteration of silica minerals
              from evaporitic deposits, and it will reveal silicification mechanisms of shell
              carbonate at the atomic scale and should shed light on fossilization processes.
