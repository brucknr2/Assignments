Abstract    :
              9418087  Allmendinger       Two fundamentally different tectonic styles are
              exhibited by  fold/thrust belts- those involving basement (thick-skinned) and 
              those involving only cover (thin skinned).  Previous work has shown  that thick
              and thin-skinned deformation are both active  simultaneously in the Andes at
              30oS, and the boundary occurs across  a geometric triangle zone between the
              central precordillera and the  eastern precordillera, Sierra Pampeanas.  This
              project will use a  unique industry seismic reflection data set and fieldwork
              to  investigate the hypothesis that the dramatic change of structural  geometry
              is controlled by preexisting anisotropies in the crust of  western Argentina. 
              Results should help explain the controls on  thick or thin deformation styles
              in fold-thrust belts.
