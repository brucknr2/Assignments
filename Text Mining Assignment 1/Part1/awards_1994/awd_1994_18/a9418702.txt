Abstract    :
              9418702  Madden           This project is part of a multidisciplinary study of
              the Nanga  Parbat-Haramosh Massif of the northwestern Himalaya, Pakistan.  The 
              Principal Investigators wish to assess the recent and still-active  processes
              responsible for an extraordinary episode of very young  high-grade
              metamorphism, partial melting, high strain, and rapid  denudation focused
              around the center of Nanga Parbat.  Their  ultimate goal is to exploit the
              excellent exposures and access to  active tectonic processes offered by Nanga
              Parbat to understand the  mesoscale interaction between petrological and
              mechanical processes  during collisional orogenesis.  To accomplish these goals
              they  propose to integrate a wide variety of measurements made using 
              techniques of geochronology, petrology, stable-isotope  geochemistry,
              radiogenic tracer-isotope geochemistry, seismology,  magnetotelluric sounding,
              structural geology, and geomorphology,  and then place their results into a
              geodynamic context.  ***
