Abstract    :
              9418819  Conlon    In mammals, including the human, specific enzymes
              (kallikreins) cleave a circulating protein (kininogen) to generate a small
              peptide (bradykinin) that is involved in regulating blood flow and both
              neuronal and smooth muscle activity.  This process is referred to as the
              kallikrein-kinin system but it is not known when the system arose in evolution
              or whether it plays an  important functional role in non-mammalian vertebrates.
               Dr. Conlon proposes to examine plasma samples from a wide range of aquatic
              vertebrates at different levels of evolution for the presence of the components
              of the system.  He has already purified novel bradykinin-related peptides from
              the trout and from the phylogentically ancient fish, the bowfin, and he
              proposes to systematically  investigate the biological activities of the
              peptides in their species of origin.  Dr. Conlon will study  effects on
              cardiovascular parameters  using chronically cannulated animals and identify
              target sites for the peptides using isolated tissue preparations.  The data
              will permit an assessment of the physiological importance of the
              kallikrein-kinin system in fish.  ***
