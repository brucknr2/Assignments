Abstract    :
              This award is for support for a three year study to use  surface exposure age
              dating (cosmic ray produced nuclides  such as Helium3, Neon-21, Beryllium-10
              and Aluminum-26) to  determine the timing of glacial advances and retreats in
              two  regions of AntarcticaMcMurdo Sound and Shackleton Glacier.  A combination
              of careful field work and extensive laboratory  studies are needed to test this
              relatively new dating  technique and to answer questions about the glacial
              history  of the Transantarctic Mountains.  The goals of the project  are to
              improve age determinations of the youngest Ross Sea  Drift  in McMurdo Sound,
              to calibrate production rates of  cosmogenic nuclides with new Helium-3
              measurements on Argon  dated lava flows and man made targets, to extend the
              glacial  chronology of the Ross Ice Sheet to other areas and age  ranges and to
              constrain the age of the controversial Sirius  group deposits.
