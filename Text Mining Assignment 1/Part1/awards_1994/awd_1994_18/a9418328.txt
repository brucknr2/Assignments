Abstract    :
              9418328  Mao   This award provides funding for the operation, maintenance, and
              further development of  an X-ray diffraction dacility dedicated for ultra-high
              pressure diamond-anvil cell experimentation at the National Synchrotron Light
              Source (NSLS) in Brookhaven National Laboratory. The facility makes use of the
              unique characteristics of the hard X-radiation produced by bending and wiggler
              magnets at the NSLS to characterize the physical and chemical properties of
              materials subjected to pressure in a diamond-anvil cell. Recent advances in
              diamond-cell and synchrotron X-ray diffraction technologies have opened new
              areas of research on the effect of ultra-high pressures and simultaneous
              temperatures (300 GPa and several thousand Kelvin) under conditions simulating
              those in the deep interior of planets such as Earth.  ***
