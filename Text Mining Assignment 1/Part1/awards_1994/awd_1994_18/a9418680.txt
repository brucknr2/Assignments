Abstract    :
              Reilinger  9418680  This is a project to measure, analyze, and interpret crustal
              deformatin in the transition zone form ocean spreading in the Gulf of
              California to continental strike-slip transform faulting along the greater San
              Andreas fault system.  The research will build upon GPS observations intitiated
              in 1989 by Oregon State/JPL/CICESE and subsequent observations in 1990, 1991,
              and 1993 by U.T. Dallas/MIT/CICESE.  As has been the case with 1990, 1991, and
              1993 surveys, the N. Baja-Mexicali Valley (NBMV) network to the extensive GPS
              network in southern California through simultaneous observations, and will
              continue to share common sites with the Miami U/CICESE GPS network established
              in 1993 across the Agua Blanca fault.  The research will be accomplished in
              collaboration with CICESE which will provide the majority of field expenses,
              and will participate in data reduction, analysis and interpretation.  ****
