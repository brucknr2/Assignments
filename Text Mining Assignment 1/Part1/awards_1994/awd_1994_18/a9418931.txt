Abstract    :
              9418931  Dilles  The origin of porphyry copper mineralization has been  broadly
              related to magmatic hydrothermal fluids that evolve  during crystallization of
              upper crustal, granitic magma  chambers.  The research will provide critical
              geochemical  data from porphyry copper granites that are exposed in cross- 
              section from <1 to >6 km depth (e.g. the Yerington district,  Nevada).  The
              data will provide a field laboratory test of  the current theoretical and
              experimental models of granite  crystallization and evolution of highly saline,
              copper- and  sulfur-rich fluids that precipitated ores.  The research  will
              emphasize analysis of copper, sulfur, zinc, and copper  contents of granite
              biotite, magnetite, hornblende, and  sulfides (pyrite, chalcopyrite).  Analyses
              will be done by  electron microprobe and ion microprobe, allowing 
              quantification of contents to the one part-per-million  level.  The behavior of
               the trace elements can then be used  to estimate at what depths and when
              during crystallization  that granites reached water saturation and lose copper
              and  sulfur.  The isotopic and compositional data will allow  quantification of
              the importance of the non-magmatic fluids  as source of ore components.
