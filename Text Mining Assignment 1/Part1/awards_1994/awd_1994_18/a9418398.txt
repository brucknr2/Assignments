Abstract    :
              9418398  White  This is an analytical program that will produce a  comprehensive
              data set on a number of key mantle plumes.  This set will include radiogenic
              isotope ratios (Sr, Nd, and  Pb), trace elements (Rb, Cs, Sr, Ba, rare earths,
              Y, Zr, Nb,  Hf, Ta, U, Th, Pb, all the first transition metals, and  possibly
              Li, Be, As, Mo, Tl, Sn, Sb, and W), stable isotope  ratios of oxygen and boron,
              and major elements.  The effort  will focus on samples that have already been
              analyzed for a  number of elements and isotopes; it is thus more an effort  at
              complexing existing data sets rather than producing new  ones.  The analytical
              effort will be complimented by  harvesting existing data from the literature,
              filtering it  for quality, and creation of a n extensive geochemical  database
              on oceanic island and island arc volcanics.  From  the resulting data set, an
              attempt will be made to answer  the following questions:  (1) What are the
              trace element and  stable isotope characteristics of the 3 principal mantle 
              plume classes?  (2) What is the relative contribution of  various sources in
              the geochemical evolution of mantle plume  reservoirs?  (3) What are the time
              scales upon which  lithospheric recycling occurs?  (4) In what proportions are 
              the above materials present in plumes?  (5) Can the  existence of a common
              component in all plumes be verified?
