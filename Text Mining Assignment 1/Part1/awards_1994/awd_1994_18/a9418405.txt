Abstract    :
              9418405  Halgedahl         Despite the great success of paleomagnetism, our
              understanding  of the fine magnetic particles that carry the paleomagnetic
              record  is still remarkably incomplete.  Yet the behavior of these fine 
              particles could provide diagnostic tools for deciphering the origin  of NRM
              (natural remanent magnetization) in rocks, as well as the  grain sizes and
              domain states of the NRM carriers.  Such tools  would be especially useful in
              interpreting the paleomagnetism of  Paleozoic and older rocks, whose long and
              complex histories  increase the probability that their original magnetizations
              were  reset.    A series of experiments will investigate the physical bases
              that  govern AF demagnetization response of single particles carrying 
              different types of remanences.  Although previous workers have  utilized
              assemblages of particles in such studies, single particles  have several
              advantages over assemblages.  The principal advantage  is that, in a single
              particle, AF response can be directly linked  to observed changes of domain
              structure and to observed  microstructure.  ***
