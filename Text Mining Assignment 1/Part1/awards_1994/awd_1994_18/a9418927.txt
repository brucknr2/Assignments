Abstract    :
              9418927  Lutz       Apatite fission-track data are a valuable source of 
              information for examining the low end of the thermal history of  rocks. 
              Instead of exhibiting a blocking temperature above which  tracks are annealed
              and below which they are preserved, tracks are  progressively annealed (by
              shortening from the track ends) within  a relatively broad annealing zone. 
              Thus track length distributions  contain information about rate of cooling
              while within the zone of  partial annealing and, potentially, on the number and
              intensity of  multiple heating events in the history of the sample.  This
              project  will rigorously quantify track length distributions and perform 
              statistical analysis to determine the degree to which such  information can be
              extracted from a well-characterized data set.   Results will be of interest in
              the interpretation of fission track  data generally.
