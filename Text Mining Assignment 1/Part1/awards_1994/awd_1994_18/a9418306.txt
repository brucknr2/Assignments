Abstract    :
                  9418306  Butler      This award will partially support travel and
              communications  expenses for Dr. Mark J. Butler of the Department of 
              Biological Sciences at Old Dominion University in Norfolk,  Virginia, to enable
              him to make a six month stay at the   New Zealand Oceanographic Institute in
              Wellington,  New Zealand to conduct cooperative research with   Dr. Alistair
              MacDiarmid.  The research will focus on  field and laboratory experimentation
              to test hypotheses  concerning recruitment and sustainable resource use of 
              spiny or rock lobsters in the coastal waters of New Zealand and  the Florida
              Keys.    The research will initiate investigations of the potential  factors
              limiting recruitment of the common New Zealand  spiny lobster and compare
              results with similar studies of the  Caribbean lobster. The study will also
              consider the effects of  male size on mating success and fertilization rates in
               populations of spiny lobsters that differ in size due to heavy   exploitation.
               This proposal is part of a joint request for  activity under the U.S.-New
              Zealand Cooperative Science Program.  The reciprocal visit to the United States
              by Dr. MacDiarmid will  occur in early 1996 and is to be supported through the 
              New Zealand Ministry of Research, Science and Technology.
