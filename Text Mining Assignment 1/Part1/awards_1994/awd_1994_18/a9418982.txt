Abstract    :
              9418982  Cohen    It is currently possible to acquire images of the brain so as
              to reveal the regions that are active while people are performing particular
              cognitive tasks.  However, massive amounts of data (many successive images )
              are produced from these neuroimaging studies, and it is not clear how to
              efficiently analyze all of the functional information that the data contain. 
              With this award, a research group comprised of a psychologist, statistician,
              computer scientist and a radiologist (headed by Dr. Jonathan Cohen) will be
              developing new ways to analyze large sets of neuroimages.  They will improve
              techniques for image reconstruction, expand available statistical tools for
              image processing, and implement these improvements on a supercomputer.  This
              work should greatly advance the non-invasive analysis of brain function.
