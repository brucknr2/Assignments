Abstract    :
              9418848  Huskamp  This Metacenter Regional Alliance (MRA), through its SEED
              (Stimulating and Enhancing Entrepreneurial Development) program, will address
              the following, identified as barriers to accelerating the transfer of
              computational technology to individual small businesses:    - the inherent risk
              in devoting precious corporate energy to the adoption of new technology  - the
              amount of staff time that must be invested to explore applications of this
              technology  - the need for training, consultants, and computing time  -
              accessibility of these services.    A model for small business outreach in
              North Carolina will be implemented based on the academic allocation model
              currently in use by the metacenter.  Additional states will be recruited in the
              following years, and will leverage expertise from existing partners, previous
              project experience, and the resources already in place at the MRA.  The
              Southern Technology Council will take the lead in recruiting new states in the
              SEED program.    Participation form the metacenter is crucial to the success of
              this program.  With this linkage to the metacenter, the SEED program can
              connect small businesses to national resources that are normally not accessible
              to them.
