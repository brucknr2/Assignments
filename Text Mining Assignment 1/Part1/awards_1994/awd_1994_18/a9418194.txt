Abstract    :
              Pessagno  9418194   Chert and limestone samples collected from the basement
              complexes will be processed in the laboratory.  Radiolarians liberated from the
              rock matrix will be identified with our scanning electron microscope. 
              Following the productive format of previous work in other basement complexes,
              results are divisible into two important components.  First, radiolarian faunas
              will allow better dating of these basement complexes.  Careful field work
              permits selective dating and discrimination of both the igneous basement and
              any subsequent inclusions into this basement material.  Second, the
              paleobiogeographical significance of radiolarian faunas will further constrain
              models of the paleogeographic development of the Caribbean Plate.  The research
              fills in gaps in the knowledge of Earth history especially providing further
              details of the age and origin of various fragments of the Caribbean Plate.
