Abstract    :
              This award is for support for a two year collaborative  program for the
              development of data cumu-lation, as a  technique to further exploit the
              favorable characteristics  (in particular its high radio-metric sensitivity) of
              the  Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensor data  for mapping
              surface features on the polar ice sheets.  The  work will focus on the
              quantification of local surface  relief and on the refinement of existing
              topographic data  over the two focus areas of Green-land and Antarctica. 
              Although no field work is proposed here, this work is  potentially important to
              anticipated field activity in  northeast Greenland, the Siple Coast ice streams
              and the ice  divide area in West Antarctica.  Characterization of the 
              morphology and ice dynamics of the interior of large ice  sheets is an
              important component of site selection for deep  ice-core drilling.
