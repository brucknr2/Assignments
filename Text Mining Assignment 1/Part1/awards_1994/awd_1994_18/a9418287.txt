Abstract    :
              Smerdon  9418287  Abstract   The Gordon Research Conference on Mammalian DNA
              Repair Mechanisms  will be held in Ventura, California January 30 to February
              3, 1995.  %%%   This conference will address the various areas of research into
              the  molecular mechanisms involved in repair of DNA in mammalian cells  and the
              biological consequences of incomplete or inaccurate repair.  This is an
              international conference which will bring together  scientists of all ages to
              interact in a meeting format which  encourages communication.  ***
