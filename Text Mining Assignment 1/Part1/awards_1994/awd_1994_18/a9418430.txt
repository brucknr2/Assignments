              Biochemistry Panel Summary PRIVATE     Edward DeMoll  MCB 9418430    The PI has
              presented data from a series of excellent preliminary studies on the
              biosynthesis of biotin.  This is a difficult research topic, but one of great
              importance to the general field of micromolecular biosynthesis.  The proposal
              contains a very interesting series of experiments which should provide a
              reasonable amount of new data on mechanisms of sulfur insertion into biotin. 
              The panel expressed some concern about the intense competition in this field
              and the situation that the PI may find himself doing work already completed by
              others. Nevertheless, the research plan is sound and clearly presented.  The
              panel placed the proposal into the "excellent" category and strongly
              recommended funding.
