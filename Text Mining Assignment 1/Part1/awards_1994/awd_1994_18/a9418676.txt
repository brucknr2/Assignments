Abstract    :
              9418676  Manchester   In July 1996, the Fifth International Organization of
              Palaeobotany Conference (IOPC-5)  will convene in Santa Barbara, California to
              address the theme of floristic evolution and biogeographic interchange through
              geologic time.  The objectives of IOPC-5 are to:  1) encourage scientific and
              professional interaction among paleobotanists from different parts of the world
              studying a range of geologic times and systematic groups; 2) provide improved
              opportunities for the participation of students (particularly women and U.S.
              minorities) in a major international and national meeting; and 3) gain an
              improved understanding of the global history of plant evolution through
              comparison of data summarized from all continents for different geologic time
              intervals.  Support is requested to help attain these goals by:  covering the
              travel costs for two participants in each of eight primary symposia and
              subsidizing registration costs for students, women, and U.S. minorities.
