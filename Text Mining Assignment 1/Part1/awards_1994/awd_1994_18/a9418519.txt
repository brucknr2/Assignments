Abstract    :
              9418519  Grove   This award provides partial funding (74% of total cost) for an
              upgrade to the geochronology laboratory operated in the Department of Earth and
              Space Sciences at the University of California at Los Angeles. The institution
              is committed to providing the remaining funds necessary to carry out the
              project. The upgrade will result in the automation of the noble gas mass
              spectrometer operation and its associated gas extraction line used primarily
              for geochronology with the 40argon/39argon technique. The UCLA geochronology
              laboratory is involved in several on-campus research projects as well as
              collaborations with off-campus scientists that require the high sample
              throughput capabilities that will be achieved by this upgrade.   ***
