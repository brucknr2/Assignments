Abstract    :
              9418376  Rood        This project is part of the Southern Hemisphere Marine
              Aerosol Characterization  Experiment (ACE-1), which will be conducted in the
              remote Southern Pacific in 1995 using  aircraft, ship-board, and ground-based
              measurements of a wide variety of chemical species,  physical  and
              meteorological parameters with the central goal of investigating the formation,
               evolution, and optical properties of atmospheric aerosol. In this component,
              measurements of  the ambient aerosol s mass scattering coefficient, its
              dependence on the wavelength of light,  direction of light scattered, and
              relative humidity will be carried out at Cape Grim,  Tasmania. These results
              will be integrated with experimental data on aerosol particle  diameter
              dependence on relative humidity and particle composition, and then compared
              with  modeled results using chemical equilibrium and aerosol particle light
              scattering codes.  Results of this research will be used as direct input to
              global scale climate models which  describe the effect of ambient aerosol
              particles on the radiative energy balance.        Aerosol mass scattering
              coefficients will be determined using controlled relative  humidity
              nephelometry, filter sampling, and ion chromatography. Aerosol particle light 
              scattering dependence on relative humidity will be determined at three
              wavelengths and as  total and back scattered light. Other ACE-1 participants
              will contribute measurements of  aerosol particle size dependence on relative
              humidity using tandem differential mobility  measurements.
