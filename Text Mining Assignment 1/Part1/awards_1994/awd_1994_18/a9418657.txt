Abstract    :
              9418657  Kelts    The western Mediterranean paleoclimate during the last 40ka
              remains  controversial in terms of comparing structure and timing of events 
              with higher latitudes.  This proposal targets the development of  high
              resolution sediment and isotope stratigraphies from 3 sites of  the eastern
              Iberian peninsula.  Its objectives are to move toward  a time-series approach
              to testing for the coherency of abrupt  humid/arid transitions including
              potential moisture impacts from  Heinrich events or Dansgaard-Oschger cycles
              over a region  transitional between Europe and Africa.    The project is a
              unique collaborative opportunity with Spanish  colleagues from Barcelona who
              will provide supporting  paleoecological analyses and the access to
              high-quality, long,  continuous lacustrine cores.  These cores have adequate
              dating to  prove they contain records back >40ka BP.  These 3 sites:  La Paul 
              de Bubal (central Pyrenees), Lake Banyoles (eastern Pyrenees) in  the north and
              Lake Salines in southeast Spain, form a transect  across moisture gradients. 
              Each core contains abundant, good  authigenic and biogenic carbonate phases
              which faithfully archive  isotope signatures of the past aqueous dynamics.  The
              results will  be interpreted within the context of changing climatic patterns 
              which determine effective moisture.  The project will also test new  strategies
              for the interpretation of carbon and oxygen isotopic  ratios.  Because of the
              inherent difficulties of interpreting stable  isotopes from dynamic continental
              areas, this project depends on  the careful integration of several proxies
              (sediment, Geochemical,  magnetic, isotope and pollen) as well micro-scale
              facies analyses  and sample characterization.  Supplementary AMS radiocarbon
              and  Th/U dating will be applied to increase precision across event 
              transitions.
