Abstract    :
              9418484  Negussey  The project will investigate the causes and mechanisms that 
              contribute to mudslides and mudboils in the Tully Valley,  New York State. 
              Field investigation will include boreholes  in landslide sites and in
              undisturbed ground along the  limits of the slide, in-situ shear tests and pore
              pressure  transducers measurements and this information together with  existing
              data will be used to establish a stratigrahic  section for stability analysis. 
              Laboratory tests on a  series of consolidated undrained samples will be
              conducted  to investigate anisotropy.  The results from the field and 
              laboratory tests will be used to select and verify  appropriate soil models, to
              analyze stability using limit  equilibrium and finite element methods and
              aiming at  identifying both the landslide mechanisms and the  sensitivity of
              the analysis to key parameters.  The results  of this work will provide a
              better understanding of the  landslide process and the development of
              mitigation  measures.  ***
