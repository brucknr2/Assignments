Abstract    :
              9418754  Abercrombie    This research is to investigate both the depth and
              frequency dependence of both scattering and intrinsic seismic attenuation using
              seismic data recorded at the Cajon Pass borehole.  Most of the previous studies
              separating scattering from intrinsic attenuation assumed that they are constant
              throughout the half space.  However, recent work indicates that at least Qs is
              about 100 times higher at 2.5 km depth than surface studies have predicted. 
              Effects on coda waves of a low Q layer at the surface and also depth variations
              of attenuation associated with the brittle-ductile transition will be
              investigated.  The results will apply to studies of variations of Q before
              earthquakes and to path corrections used in earthquake source studies.  This
              research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
