Abstract    :
              9418042  Agnew   This award provides modest funding for the acquisition of four
              portable radios needed for communications in remote field locations. The radios
              will be used by researchers from the Pinyon Flat Observatory of the University
              of California at San Diego who are involved in field projects measuring crustal
              deformation using the Global Positioning System (GPS) for accurate geodetic
              determinations of regional strain in connection with earthquake and tectonics
              research. The field operations often leave individual workers with equipment at
              isolated and remote sites for significant periods of time. The radios are
              necessary for technical communications among workers at several such sights as
              well as for safety considerations.  ***
