Abstract    :
              The color patterns of butterfly wings are some of the most  spectacular examples
              of pattern formation in cellular  fields.  Little is known, however, about how
              these patterns  develop and evolve.  Recently, a molecular characterization  of
              butterfly wing pattern formation was initiated by cloning  butterfly homologs
              of numerous Drosophila appendage-  patterning genes.  The expression of these
              genes in  developing imaginal discs indicates that while the overall 
              organization of the developing butterfly wing is similar to  that of
              Drosophila, the suborganization of the butterfly  wing is marked by novel and
              dynamic patterns of regulatory  gene expression, some of which presage the
              future position  of adult wing pattern elements.  The project proposed here 
              aims to test three hypotheses emanating from this initial  characterization of
              the patterning landscape in butterfly  wings, including:  (1) eyespot formation
              is the product of a  genetic circuit involving proximodistal patterning genes; 
              (2) the secreted wingless, decapentaplegic and hedgehog  signaling proteins are
              involved in wing pattern formation;  and (3) the developmental prepattern may
              be conserved and  its interpretation by downstream genes is species-specific. 
              The experimental plan involves the cloning of several  additional proximodistal
              patterning genes, the analysis of  their spatial and temporal relationships
              throughout wing  formation, assessment of individual protein functions  through
              ectopic expression studies, and the comparative  analysis of developmental
              prepatterns in different butterfly  species.  The combination of descriptive,
              experimental, and  comparative work is aimed at identifying some of the 
              principal mechanisms guiding the development and evolution  of wing patterns.
