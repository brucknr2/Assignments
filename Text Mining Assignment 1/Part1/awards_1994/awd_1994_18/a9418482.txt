Abstract    :
              9418482  Fan      This research is to study the Vrancea seismic zone, located in
              the eastern part of the Carpathian arc, which is well known for
              intermediate-depth seismicity associated with subduction, or continental
              collision.  New data accumulated in the last decade will allow the
              investigation of the source-time history of more than 25 medium-sized
              earthquakes and the development of a detailed velocity structure for the region
              above the seismic zone.  The work will be done in collaboration with Dr.
              Oncescu of the Romanian Center for Earth Physics and Seismology; the Romanians
              operate a digital regional network equipped with short-period seismometers. 
              The origin and tectonic history of this seismic zone is the subject of
              considerable controversy, and it is uncertain whether it is due to
              continent-continent collision, or the remanents of oceanic subduction.  This
              study will provide new information on the geometry and the stress regime within
              the downgoing slab.  Numerous strong earthquakes have occurred in the Vrancea
              zone and have caused fatalities and extensive damaging.  These studies should
              provide a better understanding of seismic hazard in this type of tectonic
              environment.  This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard
              Reduction Program.    ***  ??
