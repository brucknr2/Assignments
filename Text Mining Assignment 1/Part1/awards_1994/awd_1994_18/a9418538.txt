Abstract    :
              9418538  Tucker       Although the Mesozoic and Cenozoic breakup of Gondwana is
              well  understood, the late precambrian assembly of the supercontinent is  not
              well developed.  This project involves extensive age  determination on the
              crystalline bedrock of Madagascar which will  help constrain the configuration
              and age of the apparent cratonic  blocks within gondwana and the timing of
              fusion between east and  west gondwana.  The work will be done in conjunction
              with an  ongoing project within several South African Universities.  Results 
              should impact the temporal evolution of this part of the Mozambique  orogenic
              belt and improve the understanding of Madagascar's  geologic setting within the
              larger framework of the gondwana  supercontinent.
