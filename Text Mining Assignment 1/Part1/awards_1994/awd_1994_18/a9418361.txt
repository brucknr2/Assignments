Abstract    :
              9418361  Fourkas  This starter grant award to Boston College will support the 
              research of Professor John Fourkas. The research will focus on  ultrafast
              dynamics of stretched liquids. Negative presure  techniques will be used to
              control the relative importance of  intermolecular attractive forces. 
              Ultrafast nonlinear-optical  spectroscopic techniques will be used as a
              sensitive, real-time  probe of the microscopic dynamics that are affected by 
              tension-induced changes in the intermolecular potential.  Optical Kerr effect
              experiments will monitor the effects of  stretching on intermolecular
              vibrational and intramolecular  reorientational dynamics, both of which are
              strongly affected  by attractive forces.  Initial experiments will involve 
              studying anomalous behavior of water, and techniques will be  developed to
              study arbitrary liquids at substantial negative  pressures.    A detailed
              knowledge of the roles of attractive and repulsive  intermolecular interactions
              is essential in developing an  understanding of the microscopic details of
              chemical processes  in solution with the ultimate goal of being able to observe
              and  control directly the course of chemical reactions in solution  through
              changes in the nature of the liquid itself.
