Abstract    :
              9418378  Walther  The research supported through this award will determine 
              experimental equilibrium solubilities of a number of  geologically important
              silicates at elevated temperatures  (350-650 oC) and pressures (up to 3 kb) in
              aqueous salt  fluids.  Emphasis will be placed on studies of silica,  sodium,
              and particularly aluminum speciation in H2O-salt  solutions.  These data will
              find application in modelling  fluid-rock interactions in metamorphic
              processes.
