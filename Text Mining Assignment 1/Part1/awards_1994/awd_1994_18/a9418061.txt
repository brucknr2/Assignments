Abstract    :
              Tarduno  9418061  The PI will sample several pelagic cores from the equatorial
              Pacific to quantify magnetic reduction in pelagic sediments and its
              relationship to paleointensity and directional recording.  To accomlish this he
              will collect a host of rock magnetic (hysteresis measurements, IRM, ARM, K, low
              temperature treatments) and paleomagnetic data (demagnetized remanence) and
              combine these with information from magnetic separates (XRD, SEM, TEM) and
              geochemical analyses (Fe, Mn, S).  ****
