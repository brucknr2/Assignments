Abstract    :
              Jekell  9418223  The object of this proposal is to study thoroughly the
              determination of geoid profiles as well as vertical gravity gradients based on
              airborne vector gravimetry (specifically, derived from measurements of the
              horizontal gravity components) using a combination of satellite and inertial
              positioning instrumentation.  This investigation will be accomplished using
              statistical error analyses and evaluations of existing and upcoming horizontall
              gravity component data sources.  The assessment will be a function of
              limitation in instrumentation, surveying procedures, and data processing
              techniques and will be aimed at demonstrating the suitability of airborne
              vector gravimetry for a multitude of geodetic, geophysical, and geologic
              applications that would benefit from improved geoid and vertical gradient
              information.  ****
