Abstract    :
              9418437  Giletti  A principal goal of this research is to understand the
              mechanisms and controlling parameters that govern diffusion in minerals,
              particularly by cations.  The focus will continue to be the feldspars, in order
              to develop a systematic and sufficiently comprehensive body of data.  These
              data will form the basis for a predictive model for cations, including those
              not studied.  The proposed research will include determining the diffusion
              mechanisms and their controlling factors for cations in feldspars, developing a
              theoretical basis for predicting diffusion kinetics behavior, continuing to
              measure the Pb diffusion in monazite and extend it to other minerals such as
              titanite and rutile, and extending determination of Sr diffusion kinetics to
              mica, apatite and titanite.  The two latter studies are especially important in
              defining precisely the diffusion behavior of geochronologically important
              systems so that realistic interpretations of th edata can be made.  Most of the
              analytical data will be determined by ion microprobe.
