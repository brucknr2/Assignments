Abstract    :
              9418046  Vincek  The major histocompatibility complex (Mhc) is one of the key
              elements the clonal immune response that protects advanced vertebrates from
              parasites.  Because of its central role in an individual's immune response, the
              Mhc has been studied extensively by immunologists and geneticists.  However,
              the information concerning its evolution is rather scant.  Whether the Mhc and
              indeed clonal immunity, exist in primitive vertebrates, non-vertebrate
              chordates, and invertebrates is not known.  The question of the emergence of
              immunity in phylogeny is of considerable interest because if alternatives exist
              to the immune response protecting advanced vertebrates, they may not be without
              significance to humans.  %%%  The isolation and characterization of Mhc genes
              from zebrafish will provide valuable information concerning the primordial
              function of the Mhc, and increase our knowledge regarding the evolution of
              immunity.  ***
