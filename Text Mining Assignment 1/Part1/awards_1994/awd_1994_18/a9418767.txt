Abstract    :
              9418767  Mathur    This Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC)
              is  being funded as a multi-site research Center.  Purdue University  and the
              University of Florida is adding the University of Oregon  (including Oregon
              State University, the Oregon Graduate Institute  of Science & Technology and
              Portland State University) as research  sites in the I/UCRC for Software
              Engineering (SERC).  Seven  companies will join SERC inconjunction with the
              University of  Oregon becoming an additional research site in the Center.   
              The Center's research agenda will be increased by research projects  on "Time
              Insensitive Binary to Binary Translation; "Entropy-Based  Measure of Software
              Complexity and Its Application to Software  Testing", "Visual Programming
              Languages", "Human Computer  Interaction", and "Software Engineering Tools for
              the Construction  of Network Applications."    The researchers of involved with
              the Center are qualified to  perform the research projects.    The Center has
              been coordinated with Dr. Bruce Barnes, Program  Director of the Computer
              Computation Research Program at NSF.      The U.S. Department of Army has
              provided funding to augment the  Centers ongoing research program and to obtain
              a membership in the  Center.    The Program Manager recommends the Purdue
              University be awarded  $50,000 for the first year of a five year continuing
              award.  An  additional $35,437 is recommended for one year with funds provided 
              by Purdue University.    Near the end of each 12-month period, the Program
              Manager and/or  the Division Director of the Engineering Education Centers
              Division  will review the progress of the Center on a number of renewal 
              criteria, including the following:  1) the extent to which the 
              industry/university interaction is developing; 2) the extent to  which the
              support base is developing; and 3) the extent to which a  robust research
              program is developing.  If the review is  satisfactory, the Program Manager
              will recommends support for the  next period of this co ntinuing award.
