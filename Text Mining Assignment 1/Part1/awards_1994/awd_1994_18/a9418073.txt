Abstract    :
              94180730  Fall     Research conducted with earlier grants has resulted in the
              discovery of major fluxes of methanol and other volatile organic compounds
              (VOCs) from vegetation to the atmosphere. It is now proposed to use sensitive
              and specific enzyme/fluorescence methods to measure the emission of methanol
              and other oxygenated hydrocarbons containing one carbon from major forest tree
              species and crops, and establish the role of leaf bacteria as sinks for these
              compounds. The data obtained will be used to develop emission algorithms that
              will be validated in field experiments and in the future might be used as the
              basis of a US emissions inventory of biogenic C1-oxHCs. Plant C1-oxHC fluxes to
              the atmosphere may be very large, both regionally and globally, with long range
              transport of methanol and a variety of impacts on atmospheric chemistry.
              Currently there are large uncertainties in these flux estimates. This project
              will contribute to a more complete picture of the biogeochemical cycling of
              methanol, formaldehyde, and formic acid between the biosphere and atmosphere,
              and help establish knowledge of natural sources and sinks of these C1
              compounds.     The specific goals of the proposed work are: (1) to perfect
              enzymatic and fluorescence methods for analyzing methanol, formaldehyde, and
              formic acid emissions from vegetation; (2) to define the "drivers" of plant
              C1-oxHC emissions and collect a large data set of  oxHC fluxes in laboratory
              and greenhouse experiments; (3) develop emission algorithms for biogenic
              C1-oxHCs; (4) to establish the role of  leaf bacteria as sources and/or sinks
              of atmospheric C1-oxHCs; (5) and to validate laboratory emissions algorithms by
              appropriate field measurements of C1-oxHC fluxes.
