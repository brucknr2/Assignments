Abstract    :
              9418719  Seyfried   This research will utilize a newly developed method to
              measure near equilibrium dissolution and precipitation rates of minerals in the
              CaO-MgO-SiO2-H2O system at temperatures from 100-400 oC and pressures up to 1
              kbar.  The method involves measuring rates of crystal growth and dissolution
              during reaction of fluids with metastable reactant and stable product minerals.
               The technique to be used involves monitoring reaction progress continuously
              during experiments by means of isotopic tracers.  Metastable steady state
              conditions and adjustments of the relative states of saturation with respect to
              mineral phases  can be established by systematically changing the relative
              surface areas of "reactant" and "product".  Results of the experiments will
              provide near-equilibrium rate data for geochemically important minerals at a
              wide range of temperatures and pressures.  These data can be included in
              reaction path codes such as EQ6, which will allow construction of better models
              for the chemical evolution of fluids in active hydrothermal systems.
