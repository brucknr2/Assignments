Abstract    :
              9418665  Packard    The Principal Investigators will study two questions related
              to  superfluid helium 3, a phase which exists below 2 x 10-3 K. The  first area
              of research involves understanding the nature of helium  3 when it is in the
              form of films whose thickness is less than the  superfluid coherence length. 
              The Principals Investigators will  determine if these films will exhibit
              superfluidity when deposited  on helium 4 covered substrates.  The initial
              thrust of the program  is to develop tools to study surface waves on the film,
              so called  third sound.  These waves will be used as a probe of the films 
              properties.  The second area of activity will develop helium 3 dc  Josephson
              junctions.  These weak link structures should exhibit a  nonlinear current
              pressure characteristic.  These devices may  permit the detection of
              macroscopic quantum interference analogous  to the effects seen in dc
              superconducting quantum interference  devices.    % % %    The rare isotope
              helium 3 forms a superfluid state at temperatures  below 0.002 K.  The
              Principal Investigators will determine if very  thin films of this materials
              will continue to exhibit superfluid  properties as the thickness of the sample
              is made progressively  smaller.  To answer this question we will develop
              techniques  capable of detecting surface thickness waves.  These acoustical 
              techniques will provide insight into the properties of thin films.   The
              properties of the superfluid when it flows through very small  apertures will
              also be studied.  It is believed that the fluid  passing through submicron
              apertures will exhibit peculiar behavior  which may lead to the development of
              very sensitive superfluid  gyroscopes.  ***
