Abstract    :
              9418745  Granger      Funds are requested to support a scientific conference
              entitled "Sixth International Conference on the Juvenile Hormones" to be held
              September 10-15, 1995 in Woods Hole, Massachusetts.  The purpose of the meeting
              is the presentation and discussion of recent developments in the endocrinology
              of the juvenile hormones (JH) which regulate growth, development, and
              reproduction in the insects.  The following topics will be discussed:  1) the
              evolution of juvenile hormones; 2) JH biosynthesis and metabolism; 3)
              regulation of transport by JH; 4) regulation of JH production; 5) JH receptors
              on cells; 6) mode of action and JH-regulated genes; 7) the role of JH in
              reproduction; 8) new technology in JH research; and 9) recent developments in
              applied research.  In addition to feature lectures, there will be shorter talks
              and poster sessions.  The proceedings of the meeting will be published in a
              double volume of Archives of Insect Biochemistry and Physiology.   This is
              traditionally a small meeting, with its 80-100 participants coming from the
              United States, Canada, Europe, Israel, India, China and Japan.  Principal
              speakers to head each session are chosen from the registrants, with additional
              speakers and poster presenters chosen on the basis of submitted abstracts. 
              Participation of students and post-doctoral fellows has always been encouraged.
               This conference is unique in its focus and draws scientists working in many
              different basic and applied scientific disciplines for discussions of the
              research progress in very important aspects of insect growth and development.
