Abstract    :
                  9418793  Siegfried  The goal of this proposal is to understand the mechanism
              of cell-  cell communication that regulates the development of the fruit fly 
              Drosophila melanogaster embryo.  Wingless is a protein that is  expressed in a
              subset of cells in the embryo that can signal to  neighboring cells that don't
              express the Wingless protein and  regulate their fate. The mechanism of this
              cell signalling is  unknown but we have identified a number of other molecules
              that are  involved in the signalling pathway.  Zeste white 3 kinase, which  has
              the ability to modify other proteins by adding phosphate to  them, and
              potentially alter their activity, is one component of  this pathway.  We
              propose to identify the proteins which Zeste  white 3 kinase does modify and to
              determine how Zeste white 3  kinase activity is itself modulated.  The
              investigation of Zeste  white 3 will lead to a greater understanding of the
              Wingless  signalling. This is relevant to the understanding of vertebrate 
              growth and development since Wingless is similar to proteins found  in mice
              that are required for normal development.  In addition, the  Wingless
              signalling pathway is likely to be conserved in  vertebrates since components
              such as Zeste white 3 also have  vertebrate counterparts.   ***
