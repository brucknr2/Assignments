Abstract    :
              9418344    Byrne       Ancient deformed accretionary prisms commonly preserve 
              patterns of multiple microstructure such as cleavage generations,  fiberous
              overgrowths and oriented vein sets. Inversions of these  kinematic indications
              to relative plate motions during the  deformation event, which is of
              fundamental importance, is quite  speculative due to lack of rigorous tests of
              the hypothesis that  they accurately reflect such motions. This project will
              examine the  pattern of overprinting fabrics and kinematic indicators from the 
              Shimanto Belt of Southwest Japan, an example selected because of a  well-known
              and significant change in convergence directions during  the deformation of the
              Belt, and because this well exposed area has  recieved considerable geologic
              study. Results should provide a  clear test of the idea that such features can
              be inverted to obtain  the relative convergence directions between the plates
              involved.  Success in assessing the degree to which such inversion results in 
              accurate plate motions will be widely applicable to other origins.
