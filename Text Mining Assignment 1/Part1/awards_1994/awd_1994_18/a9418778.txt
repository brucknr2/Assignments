Abstract    :
              9418778  O'Leary  This starter grant award to Pomona College will support the 
              research of Professor Daniel O'Leary. The major focus of the  research will be
              the synthesis and characterization of  oligomeric model systems to better
              understand the solution  properties of helical poly-(alkylisocyanates).  The
              driving  force for the helical preference is the minimization of steric 
              repulsion of proximal pendant groups.  Steric interactions at  the microscopic
              level will be accurately assessed with dynamic  NMR measurements and
              single-crystal X-ray crystallography.    Controlled chemical synthesis of model
              oligomers will provide  microscopic information on the structure and backbone
              dynamics  of polyisocyanate and advance our understanding of phenomena  such as
              the novel directing efects of tiny proportions of  chiral monomers upon the
              overall chain conformation,  amplification of a small per-residue deuterium
              isotope effect,  and the solvent dependence of helix persistence length.
