Abstract    :
                9418243  Gronert    This award will support the travel expenses for Dr. Scott
              Gronert  and a student research associate to enable them to spend a month 
              conducting cooperative research with Professor Leo Radom and his  research
              group at the Research School of Chemistry, the  Australian National University,
              in Canberra.  The collaborative  work will focus on the use of the density
              functional theory as  applied to various reaction systems and in particular
              reaction  pathways for proton transfer and radical addition reactions in  the
              gas phase.  In recent years, density functional theory (DFT)  has emerged as a
              very promising methodology that has been  extensively tested for very small
              molecular systems, but not for  larger molecular systems or for the proposed
              proton transfer and  radical reactions.  The combined resources of the American
              and  Australian groups are required to complete the project.  The  opportunity
              to work with the Radom group will allow for a  valuable exchange of ideas and
              methodologies.  During the visit  by the Americans to Canberra, data will be
              exchanged,  computational approaches will be tested extensively, and  decisions
              will be made as to the best DFT methods for completing  the studies.  The
              collaboration will provide an excellent  educational experience for the student
              research associate and  will expose the American investigators to valuable new
              techniques  in theoretical chemistry.
