Abstract    :
              9418154  Chamberlain             This project is part of a multidisciplinary
              study of the Nanga  Parbat-Haramosh Massif of the northwestern Himalaya,
              Pakistan.  The  Principal Investigators wish to assess the recent and
              still-active  processes responsible for an extraordinary episode of very young 
              high-grade metamorphism, partial melting, high strain, and rapid  denudation
              focused around the center of Nanga Parbat.  Their  ultimate goal is to exploit
              the excellent exposures and access to  active tectonic processes offered by
              Nanga Parbat to understand the  mesoscale interaction between petrological and
              mechanical processes  during collisional orogenesis.  To accomplish these goals
              they  propose to integrate a wide variety of measurements made using 
              techniques of geochronology, petrology, stable-isotope  geochemistry,
              radiogenic tracer-isotope geochemistry, seismology,  magnetotelluric sounding,
              structural geology, and geomorphology,  and then place their results into a
              geodynamic context.  ***
