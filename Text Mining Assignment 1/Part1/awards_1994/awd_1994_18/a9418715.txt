              Kymkowsky  In vertebrate embryos, blocks of skeletal muscle cells are attached
              to one another through a specialized junction, known as the intersomite
              junction.  This junction is structurally and functionally similar to the
              junction that connects muscle to tendon and bone in adult animals.  Desmin-type
              intermediate filaments are structural components of muscle cells and are found
              concentrated at the intersomite junction.  Studies from our lab indicate that
              desmin filaments play a critical role in maintaining the attachment of
              myofibrils to the muscle cell membrane at the intersomite junction.  Although
              it is clear that desmin can interact with the muscle cell membrane, the
              molecules involved in this interaction are unknown.  In the course of previous
              NSF funded work, we used the frog Xenopus to study the organization of desmin. 
              We determined the N-terminal  head  region of desmin mediates the interaction
              between desmin and the muscle cell membrane.  In the studies proposed here we
              will attempt to identify muscle membrane proteins that bind desmin.  We will
              use the recently devised, and high ly sensitive, yeast two-hybrid system.  In
              these studies, the head domain of desmin will be used to screen a cDNA library
              enriched in muscle components.  cDNA isolated in this screen will be
              characterized to determine whether they are in fact expressed in the muscle
              cells of the early embryo.  Proteins that they encode will be studies to
              determine their localization and function. %%% To carry out their mechanical
              functions intermediate filaments generally must interact with membranes.  Yet,
              the molecular details of intermediate filament-membrane interactions are poorly
              understood.  By identifying proteins that mediate the interaction of desmin
              filaments with muscle cell membranes, we will be able to define, at the
              molecular level, interactions critical to normal muscle cell organization and
              function. ***                         ;
