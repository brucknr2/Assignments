Abstract    :
              9418063  Masters    This research is to improve the current generation of
              surface wave dispersion maps by adding amplitude and polarization data to the
              inversion process.  Both amplitude and polarization depend on the lateral
              gradient of phase velocity and hence constrain the short wavelength structure
              of the resulting models.  Polarization data are also sensitive to anisotropy,
              and long-wavelength anisotropic structures have already been proposed to
              explain anomalous surface-wave particle motions.  This work will investigate
              the range of theories and proposed models by applying measurement techniques to
              coupled-mode synthetic seismograms computed for models with varying degrees of
              anisotropy and short-wavelength structure.  The results of these tests will be
              used to improve inversions of surface-wave phase, polarization and amplitude
              data.  The resulting observational constraints on the fine-scale and
              anisotropic structure will then be included in global tomographic inversions
              for mantle structure.  ***  ??
