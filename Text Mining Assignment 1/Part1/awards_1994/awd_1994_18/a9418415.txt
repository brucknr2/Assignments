Abstract    :
              9418415  Blankenship  Experiments are proposed to extend the current
              understanding of the  energy trapping processes, primary photochemistry and
              early  secondary electron transfer reactions in photosynthetic reaction 
              centers that contain FeS centers as early electron acceptors.  The  particular
              systems that will be studied included reaction centers  from the primitive
              anoxygenic organisms known as heliobacteria as  well as Photosystem I of
              oxygenic photosynthetic organisms.   Specific proposed experiments include
              low-temperature picosecond  transient absorbance spectroscopic studies of
              energy transfer and  trapping in both heliobacteria and Photosystem I,
              picosecond  transient absorbance measurement in the blue spectral region in 
              both systems, and investigation of secondary electron transfer  reactions in
              heliobacteria monitored using EPR and millisecond  timescale transient
              absorbance spectroscopy.  These experiments  will give new insights into the
              energy trapping process in reaction  centers that contain integral core antenna
              pigments and will help  to identify and characterize some of the early electron
              acceptors  in these systems, including chlorophylls, quinones and FeS centers. 
              %%%  This project will increase our understanding of how plants and  other
              photosynthetic organisms convert the energy of sunlight into  chemical energy. 
              The process of photosynthesis supplies all of our  food and most of our energy
              needs.  Many aspects of how  photosynthesis works are not understood at a deep
              level.  This  project is designed to give detailed knowledge of the chemical 
              mechanism of this essential biological process.  ***
