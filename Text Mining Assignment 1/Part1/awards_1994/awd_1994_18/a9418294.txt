Abstract    :
              9418192  Derry   An integrated stratigraphic, sedimentological and geochemical
              study of thin but laterally persistent "cap carbonate" rocks that overlie each
              of two main glacial units in the Neoproterozoic of Australia.  The association
              of such carbonate rocks with glacial deposits in the Neoproterozoic is now
              recognized as a global phenomenon, and in many sections the glacial to
              post-glacial transition appears to contemporaneity.  The widespread association
              of distinctive facies and pronounced  13C excursions that has been taken as
              evidence for contemporaneity.  The widespread association of distinctive facies
              and pronounced  13C excursions argues for a genetic link, a link that has
              potentially major implications for biological evolution and environmental
              change in Neoproterozoic time, but which is not yet well understood.
