Abstract    :
              9418035  Roe       This is a proposal by three faculty and three research 
              scientists at the University of Michigan to continue their  participation in
              the L3 collaboration at the LEP collider at  CERN.  In the last year the group
              has been instrumental in  installing new electronics for the hadron calorimeter
              and  has been actively participated in the analyses of Z decays  which were
              presented at the 27th International Conference on  High Energy Physics at
              Glasgow in July of 1994.  Their ACP  computer farm is particularly valuable in
              the production of  Monte Carlo events to measure the acceptance of the 
              detector.       In the course of the next grant period they expect the  energy
              of LEP to be raised above 160 GeV where it will be  possible to measure the
              mass of the W.  In addition they  expect to gain new information on the triple
              boson coupling  and to set better limits on a low mass Higgs boson.  ***
