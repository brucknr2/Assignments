Abstract    :
              9418688  Mitra    Thrust sheets is the hinterland portion of many
              fold-and-thrust  belts tend to be larger and show larger displacement than
              those in  more outboard positions and appear to control the overall taper of  a
              fold-thrust belt during deformation.  This project will examine  the strain
              variation pattern within the sheeprock thrust sheet  using spatial statistics
              in order to understand the geometry and  deformational history of these large
              sheets, and to asses  the  driving forces that are implied by the critical
              wedge theory.   Results will be applicable to many fold-thrust belts.
