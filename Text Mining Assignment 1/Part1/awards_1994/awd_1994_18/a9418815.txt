Abstract    :
              9418815    The long range goal of this research is to gain insight into
              mechanisms underlying the modulation of synaptic transmission.  It is now clear
              that many neurons contain more than one transmitter and it is important to
              determine how multiple transmitters released from the terminals of single
              neurons interact on presynaptic and postsynaptic targets.  Specifically,
              neuropeptide transmitters appear to commonly coexist along with conventional
              transmitters.  The relatively simple nervous system of Aplysia has a number of
              advantages that make it particularly useful as a model system for these
              studies.  One goal of this grant is to explore the manner in which
              neuropeptides that are released from motor neurons interact tio modulate the
              effectiveness of other transmitters released from the same neuron.  A second
              goal is to investigate the effects of a biogenic amine, serotonin, released
              from purely modulatory neurons which have neuromuscular terminals.  The
              neuropeptides and serotonin have been shown to be potent modulators of
              neuromuscular transmission.   These studies have implications for vertebrate
              skeletal neuromuscular junctions where peptide cotransmitters have also been
              found.  A third goal is to characterize the release of these peptide
              cotransmitters from identified neurons in primary culture.  This highly reduced
              preparation permits detailed analyses of factors which regulate peptide
              release.  Understanding fundamental neural processes such as the modulation of
              synaptic transmission at these neuromuscular synapses could provide a more
              general understanding of synapses which release multiple transmitters as well
              as have relevance to disorders of movement.
