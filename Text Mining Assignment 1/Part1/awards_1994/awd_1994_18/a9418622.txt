Abstract    :
              This award is for support for a three year program to  continue theoretical
              study of the West Antarctic ice sheet,  including the enhancement of a
              three-dimensional time-  dependent whole-ice sheet simulation program developed
              to  help understand the three dimensional interactions of ice  streams B and C
              and their boundaries.  This work will  improve on the basic model and will
              include those features  necessary to allow the simulation code to be generally 
              useful to the complete set of problems for which the physics  is appropriate in
              both the Antarctic and Arctic.  The model  studies proposed are a general mass
              balance study of the  West Antarctic ice sheet to get boundary para-meters
              fixed,  then an in-depth study of Ice Steams B and C to determine  the
              magnitude of different proposed mechanisms which govern  their behavior.
