Abstract    :
              Hoffman  9418862  The lively controversy now encircling geomagnetic reversal
              studies--as to whether the paleomagnetic field is geographically biased during
              polarity transitions--has stimulated considerable interest throughout the SEDI
              community.  The excitement in part comes from the possibility that these
              paleomagnetic records may be capable of providing direct information about
              long-term core-mantle interactions and the state of the geodynamo.  The work
              plan is to search out as many sequences of lava as may be accessible on Tahiti
              that record field behavior during the Matuyama-Brunhes reversal.  All R-N
              transition zones will be subjected to radiometric age determination.  A
              detailed sampling of all confirmed M/B sequences will be conducted, followed by
              the development of a composite record.  ****
