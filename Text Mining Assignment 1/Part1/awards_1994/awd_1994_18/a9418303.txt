Abstract    :
              Kyte  9418303    It is proposed to continue the broad-based research program
              which is designed to make significant advances in the understanding of the
              chemical and mineralogical record of extraterrestrial matter to the Earth, as
              recorded in terrestrial sediments.  We propose research into the mineralogy and
              geochemistry of debris from three distinct impact events.  (1) In the next
              three years our principal objective will be a renewed investigation of a unique
              deposit that we discovered.  It records an asteroid impact into a deep-ocean
              basin during the late Pliocene.  Will join a German polar research expedition
              in Spring 1995 that will engage in a geophysical and geological exploration of
              the region in which the impact occurred.   Sediment cores recovered that
              contain debris from the impact will be the subject of mineralogical and
              geochemical analyses to learn about the physical and chemical evolution of this
              impact event as well as to use it as an analog to Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary
              deposits.  (2) We will also investigate the detailed geochemistry of an early
              Archean (-3.4 Ga) spherule bed which may record a major asteroid impact as well
              as a major change in the tectonic evolution of the Barberton Greenstone Belt. 
              We will concentrate on determining whether there is geochemical evidence to
              support the hypothesis that gradations across the spherule bed reflect chemical
              and thermal evolution of an impact-generated vapor cloud.  (3) Additionally we
              will characterize the abundance, distribution, and composition of
              Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary impact debris in sediments from the Atlantic and
              Indian Oceans.  This will approximately double the portion of the Earth's
              surface studied in this way greatly improve our model of the evolution and
              distribution of impact debris relative to the Chicxulub structure.  (4) We also
              anticipate that we will be requested to provide Ir analyses for other
              researchers.  As our schedule permits, we will assist in such problems, if
              appropriate.
