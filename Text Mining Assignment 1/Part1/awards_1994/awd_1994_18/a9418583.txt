Abstract    :
              9418583  Humphreys   This award provides one-half the funding for an upgrade to
              the computational resources in the Department of Geological Sciences at the
              University of Oregon. The institution is committed to providing the remaining
              funds lecessary to acquire the equipment. The computer system upgrade will be
              used primarily in the research and teaching programs of several faculty members
              and their students in geophysics. Their areas of research include
              regional-scale seismic imaging of the crust and mantle, kinematic and dynamic
              modeling of lithospheric deformation, seismic imaging of ocean ridge-crest
              structures, and paleoseismicity studies.  ***
