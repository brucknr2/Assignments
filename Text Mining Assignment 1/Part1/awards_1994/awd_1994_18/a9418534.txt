Abstract    :
              9418534  White    The University of California, Berkeley Industry/University 
              Cooperative Research Center for Sensors and Actuators is being  funded for
              three years by a "Self-Sufficient Partnership for  Research" Program award
              through the Industry/University Cooperative  Research Centers Program.   
              Additional funding is provided for an evaluator for three years to  study the
              industry/university interaction occurring in the Center.    Funding is also
              being provided for an African-American  undergraduate to perform a one year
              study.  The study, which  augments the Center's research program, will focus on
              the maximum  quality factor attainable by resonators constructed from 
              polycrystalline silicon which are measurable only under vacuum.    The
              researchers are internationally recognized scientists in this  field and are
              well qualified to perform the Center's research  projects.     This Center is
              being cosponsored by Dr. Deborah Crawford, Solid  State and Microstructure
              Program.    The Program Manager recommends the University of California, 
              Berkeley be awarded a total of $163,000 for one year:  $158,000 for  the first
              year of a three-year continuing award (this includes  $100,00 cost sharing from
              the Solid State and Microstructure  Program and $8,000 for an evaluator); and
              $5,000 for one year with  funds provided by the Women, Minorities, and Disabled
              Engineering  Research Assistants Program.  Funding for year two through three 
              are recommended at the level of $108,000 per year ($100,000 per  year from the
              Solid State and Microstructure Program and $8,000 per  year for the evaluator.
