Abstract    :
              9418236  Dalziel       A recent hypothesis that the proto-Appalachian margin of 
              Laurentia rifted from the proto-Andean Margin of South america at  the end of
              the Precambrian, and that the Appalachian and Andean  orogens were initially a
              single mountain system resulting from  Paleozoic Laurentia-Gondwana
              interaction, has many far reaching  implications.  This project will test this
              hypothesis principally  by geologic and geochronologic study of poorly known
              but critical  basement rocks of the Andean Cordillera in northernmost Chile and
               a paleomagnetic study of Cambrian, Ordovician, and Silurian Strata  of the
              northwest Argentine Precordillera.  Results should increase  understanding of
              the origin and development of the Pacific margin  of South America in addition
              to testing the SWEAT hypothesis.
