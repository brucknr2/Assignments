Abstract    :
              9418991  MacLaughlin    Electronic structure, magnetism, and superconductivity
              in  highly correlated electron materials will be investigated  using nuclear
              magnetic resonance and muon spin rotation  techniques.  The research uses the
              sensitivity of these two  techniques to microscopic (atomic) charge and spin 
              correlations as tools to probe local effects of strong  electron correlation. 
              The techniques will be used to study  four different systems:  1) spin
              susceptibility, charge and  spin dynamics in lanthanum based planar cuprates
              and  nickelates which exhibit quantum and anti ferromagnetism, 2)  spin-liquid
              behavior and effects of defects (chain breaks,  hole doping) in Haldane chain
              compounds, 3) non-Fermi-liquid  properties of Kondo alloys and heavy-fermion
              compounds, and  4) dynamics of low-lying superconducting excitations in 
              uranium based heavy-fermion superconductors.  %%%  Understanding effects of
              correlations between electrons on  magnetism and conduction in solids remains
              an important  unsolved problem in condensed matter physics.  This research 
              uses magnetic resonance techniques as a probe of correlated-  electron behavior
              at the atomic level.  In magnetic  resonance, the weak but measurable magnetism
              of probe"  magnetic moments, (e.g. nuclei) is used to "spy" on the  local
              magnetic environment of the probes, which do not  seriously perturb their
              surroundings.  The research seeks  better understanding of the behavior of 1)
              oxide magnets  closely related to high-temperature superconductors, and 2)  the
              so-called heavy-electron metals, in which electrons  behave as if they were
              hundreds or even thousands of times  more massive than the free electrons.  The
              work will involve  university, government laboratory, industrial and 
              international collaboration.  ***
