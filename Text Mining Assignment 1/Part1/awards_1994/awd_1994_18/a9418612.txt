Abstract    :
              9418612  Foufoula-Georgiou    The Fifth International Conference on
              Precipitation will be held in  Crete, Greece in June 14-16, 1995.  Following 
              the tradition of the  previous four conferences this meeting aims at fostering 
              interdisciplinary interaction between meteorologists, hydrologists, 
              mathematicians and statisticians.  The central theme of the  conference will be
              research issues related to the problem of  linking stochastic and dynamic of
              descriptions of rainfall for the  purpose of modeling, estimation, and
              forecasting.  In particular,  emphasis will be placed on the following topics:
              (a) precipitation  dynamics, (b) space-time variability and statistical 
              characterization, (c) linkages between dynamics and stochastic  descriptions,
              and (d) applications of physical and/or statistical  theories in the
              development of rainfall estimation/retrieval  algorithms
