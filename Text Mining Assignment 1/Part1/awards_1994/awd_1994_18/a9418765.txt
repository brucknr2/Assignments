Abstract    :
              9418765  Trivedi    The North Carolina State University Industry/University
              Cooperative  Research Center for Advanced Computing and Communication is 
              becoming a multi-university Center with the addition of a research  site at
              Duke University.  Four companies are becoming part of the  Center inconjunction
              with Duke University becoming a research site.    The research agenda of the
              new multi-site Center will address high-  speed networking, reliable and
              fault-tolerant systems, digital  communication systems, distributed systems,
              and algorithms and  digital image processing algorithms.    Additional funding
              to augment the ongoing research program and to  obtain a membership in the
              Center is being provided by the U.S.  Department of Army and National Security
              Agency.    The researchers are well qualified to perform the Center's research 
              program.    The Center is being co-funded with Dr. Yechelzkel Zalcstein in the 
              Division of Computer and Computation Research (CCR).    The Program Manager
              recommends Duke University be awarded:   $100,000 for the first year of a
              five-year continuing award (cost  shared with the I/UCRC Program and the CCR
              Division); $30,023 for  one year with funds provided by the U.S. Department of
              Army; and  $30,074 for one year with funds provided by the National Security 
              Agency.    Near the end of each 12-month period the Program Manager and/or the 
              Division Director of the Engineering Education Center Division will  review the
              progress of the Center on a number of renewal criteria  requirements, including
              the following:  1) the extent to which the  industry/university interaction is
              developing; 2) the extent to  which the support base is developing; and 3) the
              extent to which a  robust research program is developing.  If the review is 
              satisfactory, the Program Manager will recommend support for the  next period
              od this continuing award.
