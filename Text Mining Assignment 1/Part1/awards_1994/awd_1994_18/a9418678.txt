Abstract    :
              9418678  Fleming     One mutation in Drosophila melanogaster which exhibits
              neuronal  hyperplasia with concomitant reduction in hypodermal structures has 
              been named Notch. Serrate, another gene mutation, appears to play  an important
              developmental role in interacting with the Notch gene  product to mediate cell-
              to- cell signaling during the development  of tissues other than the early
              embryonic neuroblast, where the  product of another gene, Delta, seems to
              interact with Notch. Since  Ser-null alleles cause larval death, it has not
              been possible to  identify which tissues require Ser for viability or the
              possible  role of Ser post-embryonically. New approaches will be utilized to 
              answer the questions: (1.) What is the essential role played by  Serrate during
              development?  (2.) Where and when is the Serrate  protein expressed during
              development? (3.) What is the nature of  the class of dominant Serrate
              mutations that interact strongly with  null Delta alleles?  %%%  Experiments
              are proposed to investigate the function of the Serrate  gene product in the
              fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. A number of  genetic loci have been
              isolated on the basis of a common mutant  phenotype and studies have suggested
              that most of these genes  products are interactive in a manner necessary for
              the  differentiation of neuro-ectoderm. The function of one of them,  Serrate,
              will be examined in relation to its function in embryonic  development and in
              the manner in which it interacts with products  of other related gene loci.
