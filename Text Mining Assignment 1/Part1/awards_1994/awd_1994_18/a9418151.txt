Abstract    :
              9418151  Jacobs  This  project  will  process,  analyze,  and  report  the 
              findings   of  the  previously  funded  first  systematic  oceanographic  study
              of the continental  shelves  of  the  Amundsen   and   Bellingshausen  Seas,  
              which   included  temperature  and salinity profiling, water  sampling  for 
              ocean chemistry, and continuous precision bathymetry.    Upwelling  warm  deep 
              water  covers  the  Amundsen   and  Bellingshausen   shelves  and  was   found 
               to   deliver  significant  amounts of heat to the sea ice and  fringing  ice 
              shelves.  The regional precipitation is  heavy,  and  has historically
              maintained a perennial ice cover.    However, within the last few years
              satellite images  have  shown  that the ice has been receding dramatically, 
              with  large  areas of open water persisting through the  winter  in  sectors 
              that  earlier had been  ice-covered.   These  anomalous  ice  distributions are
               likely  to  have  been  accompanied  by  altered surface  water  properties, 
              and  possibly changes in the deep vertical circulation.  There  are 
              indications that the conditions favoring a reduction  in  the sea ice may
              migrate westward toward the Ross Sea,  and  may  have influenced a gradual
              wapming  over  recent  decades  on  the western side of the Antarctic
              Peninsula.  The  current  project will investigate the production  of  shelf 
              water  and  deep water through  interactions  with  coastal  polynyas and
              floating ice, and  make  use  of  a  large   body   of  ancillary  data  on 
              the  geochemical,  biological, and cryospheric environment.    The  project
              made use of the R/V Nathaniel B.  Palmer  in  two  cruises:  one in the late
              austral summer  1993-1994,  and  a  subsequent  cruise in September  and 
              October  to  observe late winter conditions.  ***
