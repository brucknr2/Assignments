              Davidson In mammals, the first three steps in de novo primidine biosynthesis
              are catalyzed by three enzymatic domains of the CAD protein including the
              enzyme dihydroorotase.  While two of the CAD enzymes are similar to their
              bacterial counterparts, the Escherichia coli and mammalian dihydroorotases are
              significantly different.  Toward the long-term goal of understanding the
              regulation and structure of the CAD gene and the structure and function of the
              CAD protein, the following experiments will be pursued with this proposal. 
              First, the 5  end of the CAD gene will be placed upstream of the
              chloroamphenicol acetyl transferase gene, and the construct will be transfected
              into cells which can be induced to interrupt the normal cell cycle.  RNA
              protection assays will be used to determine the regulatory elements that
              control CAD transcription in such cells.  Second, site-directed mutagenesis
              will be used to identify crucial residues present at the carboxyl end of the
              mammalian dihydroorotase but absent in the bacterial enzyme.  Finally, the
              region of the CAD cDNA encoding the dihydroorotase domain  (middle enzymatic
              domain) will be replaced with the sequence encoding the E. coli enzyme to
              determine how bacterial enzyme function is affected by being part of a
              multifunctional protein. %%% The first three steps of the de novo synthesis of
              pyrimidines are catalyzed by carbamyl phosphate synthetase, aspartate
              transcarbamylase, and dihydroorotase.  In mammals, these three enzymes are
              found together in a single translation product called CAD.  The proper function
              and regulation of CAD is essential for normal cellular metabolism,
              proliferation, and viability, and may be crucial in development and
              homeostasis.  Many questions remain about how the CAD gene and its protein
              product accomplish all these roles and how the gene evolved from three separate
              genes encoding monoenzymatic proteins, the arrangement seen in bacteria. 
              Experiments using genetic, molecular biology and biochemical approaches will
              provide greater insight into this complex protein that plays such a crucial
              role in normal animal development and physiology. This award is supported
