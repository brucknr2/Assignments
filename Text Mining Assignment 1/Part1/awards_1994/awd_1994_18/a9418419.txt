Abstract    :
              9418419  Covert        This project is part of the Southern Hemisphere Marine
              Aerosol Characterization Experiment (ACE-1),  which will be conducted in the
              remote Southern Pacific in 1995 using aircraft, ship-board, and ground-based 
              measurements of a wide variety of chemical species, physical  and
              meteorological parameters with the central  goal of investigating the
              formation, evolution, and optical properties of atmospheric aerosol. A
              significant  component of these objectives is the measurement of aerosol number
              and size distribution and cloud  condensation nuclei. This project will be a
              workshop held in advance of ACE-1 to intercompare the particle  counters,
              particle sizing devices, and cloud condensation nuclei counters which will be
              used on the various  ACE-1 platforms.  The goal of the workshop is to 
              determine and minimize the variance in the concentration  and size measurements
              between the different instruments such that differences measured in the field
              can be  interpreted with confidence as real and due to differences in aerosol
              physics and chemistry rather than variability  between instruments.         An
              aerosol generation facility will be constructed to produce monodisperse and
              polydisperse aerosols of  stable known size, concentration and chemical
              composition. This controlled aerosol is intended to simulate the  atmosphere
              that will be encountered during ACE-1. The participants in ACE-1 aerosol
              physics measurements  will be able to sample these aerosols in parallel and
              compare their results. The causes of differences will be  sought and minimized
              in the course of the intercomparison.
