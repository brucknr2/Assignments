Abstract    :
              9418323  Reid  The origin of Th-Pb isotope variations in mantle lithosphere 
              beneath the western USA will be investigated by examining  basalts from three
              areas:  the Western Great Basin (WGB),  Snake River Plain (SRP), and western
              Colorado Plateau and  its transition zone.  These areas highlight complementary
               and contrasting processes that may have exerted significant  control on the
              ultimate Th-Pb characteristics of the lavas  including lithosphere formation
              and mineralogy (all areas),  subduction-related metasomatism of mantle sources
              (WGB and  SRP), and plume-related enrichment of  mantle sources (SRP).  Result
              obtained to date reflect a limited sampling of two of  these areas but show
              that Th isotope disequilibria can be  related to processes of partial melting
              and to  characterizing mantle reservoirs and their origin.  Th  isotope data
              will be obtained for late Pleistocene to  Holocene basalts from tectonomagmatic
              provinces in the  western USA selected for their likelihood to yield important 
              constraints on the nature and evolution of mantle  lithosphere.  In addition to
              Th, these basalts will be  characterized for their Sr, Nd, and Pb isotope
              compositions.  Within the framework of complete major and trace element and 
              isotope analyses, disequilibrium in U-Th isotope systematics  will be used to
              consider the conditions of partial melting  and possible origins for
              lithospheric signatures in basaltic  magmas.
