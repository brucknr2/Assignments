Abstract    :
              9418264  Gromet       The Scandinavian Caledonides provide an unusual
              opportunity to  study events and processes associated with a continental
              collision  because it is relatively simple, involving a single orogenic cycle, 
              and is eroded so that both allochthonous and autochthonous rocks  are exposed. 
              This project, in conjunction with researchers in  Norway and Sweden, is
              directed at providing improved time  constraints on tectonic processes such as
              subduction leading to  high-pressure metamorphism and assembly of a
              tectonostratigraphy by  major thrust imbrication.  Detailed geochronlogic
              studies will use  high-precision U-Pb and other methods to directly date
              metamorphism  and deformational fabrics in key areas.  Results, along with
              field  structural studies, will lead to more precise understanding of the 
              development of this classic orogen.
