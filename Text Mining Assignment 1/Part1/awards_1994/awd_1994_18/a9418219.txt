Abstract    :
              9418219  McNutt  This project will support a post-doctoral investigator to 
              complete an existing database ion volcanic tremor from more  thal 160 volcanoes
              around the world.  The most important  parameter to be investigated is the
              amplitude of tremor  which is normalized to reduced displacement.  This problem
               is as fundamental as the determination of earthquake  magnitudes.  Preliminary
              results show that tremor reduced  displacements during eruptions are
              proportional to the  Volcano Explosivity Index (VEI), which is proportional to 
              the tephra volume.  We propose to test the hypothesis that  the energy of
              volcanic tremor is directly proportional to  the volume of magma and its
              contained volatiles.  We will  measure the seismic efficiencies of tremor, and
              we show  preliminary data that suggest there are different  efficiencies for
              different eruptive mechanisms.  This  project is complementary to many
              theoretical studies.  It is  broad and wide ranging because it includes data
              from all  known seismically monitored volcanoes worldwide.  Although  the chief
              value of the project is scientific, several  components, especially reduced
              displacement versus VEI, also  have a direct bearing on volcanic hazards
              assessment and  forecasting.
