Abstract    :
              9418520  Wasson  The P.I.s propose to use the UCLA Cameca 1270 ion-microprobe
              and petrographic techniques to determine the three O-isotopes in the conducting
              phase magnetite present in unequilibrated chondritic meteorites in order to
              obtain detailed compositional data that relate to:  (1) the nebular processes
              that led to the formation of the chondrites; (2) the compositions of major O
              reservoirs that contributed to the solar nebula; and (3) low-grade metamorphic
              processes that occurred in parent bodies.  During the next year the P.I.s will
              study the formation of the magnetite in unequilibrated carbonaceous (CV) and
              ordinary   (H, L, LL) chondrites.  The P.I.s examination of many thin sections
              of CV chondrites shows that magnetite is relatively common in chondrules.  The
              P.I.s will use the ion microprobe to determine the compositions of these
              magnetites on the oxygen 3-isotope diagram relative to other CV minerals that
              describe a mixing line extending from   18O values <-40%  along a slope of   
              0.94 almost to the intersection of this line with the terrestrial fractionation
              line.  A key question the P.I.s hope to answer is whether this magnetite formed
              in the solar nebula or during the oxidation of the CV parent body.  The P.I.s'
              second project will be to examine the three O isotopes in magnetite present in
              magnetite-carbide assemblages in some unequilibrated ordinary chondrites.  Krot
              discovered a number of  these assemblages while at UCLA.  The origin of these
              oxidized/reduced assemblages is not known; again, the possible locales are the
              solar nebula and the parent body.  Precise O-isotope data will provide
              important constraints both on the locale and on the nature of the agent that
              oxidized the Fe of the magnetite.
