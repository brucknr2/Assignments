Abstract    :
              9418207  Quade   Weathering of sediments derived from uplift of the Himalayas
              has had a major impact on the chemistry of the oceans, on regional (now
              monsoonal) climate, and probably on atmospheric pCO2.  One of the clearest
              proxies of the effects of Himalayan uplift is the marine 87Sr/86Sr record. 
              However, the specific links between the marine Sr record and tectonism and
              weathering rates in the Himalayan hinterland are virtually undocumented.  The
              Miocene-Pleistocene detrital record of erosion of the Himalayas is contained in
              the Siwalik Group foreland-basin sediments exposed in the Himalayan frontal
              ranges, and in the Bengal submarine fan.  This research will examine changes in
              the 87Sr/86Sr ratio of sediment, weathering products, and aquatic (riverine)
              shells in Siwalik sediments deposited in central and western Nepal over the
              past 12 Ma.  These isotopic compositions will be correlated with specific
              tectonic and erosional events in the Himalayas, providing a direct link between
              physical processes in the orogenic belt (e.g., individual thrust-displacement
              events) and changes in sediment and water composition.  In turn, these studies
              will permit comparison of changes in 87Sr/86Sr ratios and other aspects of
              Siwalik sediments to the isotopic evolution of the ocean and Bengal submarine
              fan sediments.
