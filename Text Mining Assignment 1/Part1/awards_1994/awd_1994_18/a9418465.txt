Abstract    :
              9418465  Karlin     This research is to conduct geological, geophysical, and
              geotechnical studies of Puget Sound, Lake Washington, and other lakes in the
              Puget Lowland to map the submarine expression of large faults, map the
              distribution of subaqueous landslides,and obtain sedimentary records of
              earthquake history during the Holocene.  In Puget Sound, seismic reflection
              profiling, side-scan swath surveying, and coring operations will be conducted
              to examine the Seattle Fault system for evidence of recent movement and trace
              its submarine expression through Lake Sammamish, Lake Washington, Puget Sound
              to Hood Canal.  Zones of subaqueous slumping will be mapped, dated and analyzed
              to determine if they are of seismogenic origin.  On selected submarine
              landslides in Lake Washington, existing geotechnical information will be
              combined with geophysical mapping and core analysis to model minimum
              accelerations (hence, earthquake intensities) needed to trigger slope failure. 
              The sedimentary earthquake record obtained from Lake Washington will be
              verified and extended by examining anomalous disturbances in sedimentary
              sequences in other lakes in the region.  This work should help in estimates of
              seismic risk in the Seattle-Bellevue-Kirkland-Everett-Tacoma area.  This
              research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
