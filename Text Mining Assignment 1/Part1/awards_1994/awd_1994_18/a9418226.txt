Abstract    :
              This experimental study investigates coupled processes of flow and reactive mass
              in  porous media.  Of interest are reactive transport processes that involve
              coupling both through density  effects and heterogeneous chemical reactions
              that may alter the hydraulic  character of the medium.  The goal of this study
              is to contribute fundamental knowledge concerning reaction-coupled mass 
              transport.   Two and Three-dimensional experiments with flow tanks will be used
              to elucidate the  time-space evolution of reaction fronts and fluid chemistry
              in porous media, and to interpret the  nature of the feedbacks that exist
              between density-driven flow, and reactive mass transport.  The  experiments
              will involve pumping a dilute Fe(CIO4) 3 solution through a mixture of quartz
              sand and a  small quantity of crushed calcite.  The initial acidity of the
              solution will promote calcite  dissolution and lead to the precipitation of
              ferric oxyhydroxide.  The resultant pore plugging will  result in patterning in
              hydraulic conductivity and reroute fluid flow through the tanks.  These 
              patterns can be documented photog raphically in two-dimensional experiments. 
              The three-dimensional  experiments are technically more challenging and require
              that reaction fronts be described with both  in situ hydraulic conductivity
              measurements and electrical measurements with a permanently installed 
              electrode array.  This research builds on our studies of instabilities in
              variable density flows, and  will contribute new knowledge in the emerging area
              of coupled processes and practical problems of  contaminant support.
