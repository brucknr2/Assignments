Abstract    :
              Abstract  OPP 9418429    This award supports continuous-core and downhole
              logging of the  four planned Cape Roberts Project scientific drill holes.  The 
              goal of the Project is to study the Early Tertiary and Cretaceous  record of
              climate, tectonics, and sea level change, and to  determine the time of onset
              of Antarctic glaciation.  Geophysical  well logs will be converted into
              continuous records of variation  which can be interpreted as indicating
              variations in mineralogy  and porosity.  The detailed one-dimensional records
              at each hole  will be integrated with available high resolution seismic data to
               produce a two-dimensional interpretation of the stratigraphy.  This
              geophysical logging program is an essential component of  basic
              characterization of the drill site and is a fundamental  part of the effort to
              produce a stratigraphic framework for  interpretation of other scientific work
              on the core.
