Abstract    :
              9418367  Bickford       The Tans-Hudson orogen is the most extensively preserved
              Early  Proterozoic Orogenic belt on earth extending from north-central US  to
              Greenland.  It is coeval with the 1.a-1.8Ga Penokean and Wopmay  orogens and is
              unique in preserving a collage of mainly juvenile  arc rocks and later plutons
              between the two juxtaposed terranes-  the Archean Superior craton ont he
              southeast and the Archean Hearne  and Rae provinces on the northwest.  The
              Canadian Lithoprobe  reflection seismic section across the orogen has revealed
              a complex  history of the collision of the Superior and Rae/Hearne cratons, 
              however the nature and kinematics of the collisional orogensis is  largely
              unconstrained.  This program will utilize distinctive  differences in several
              isotopic system to differentiate an  correlate these terranes and their
              fragments and to use the spatial  distributions to infer tectonic style and
              kinematics of the  collision.  Results will not only improve understanding of
              this  orogen, but help reconstruct early assembly of Laurentia.
