Abstract    :
              9418863  Murphy   This project seeks to develop an integrated biostratigraphic
              zonation of the Lochkovian and Pragian Stages of the Lower Devonian based on
              stratigraphic sections and taxonomic studies of Nevadan, Spanish, Austrian, and
              Bohemian material.  It will integrate the biostratigraphies of the two most
              useful groups, the conodonts and the graptolites, with the biostratigraphies of
              the brachiopods, ostracodes microvertebrates, trilobites, dacryoconarids, and
              corals stratigraphies as they are currently known.  The project necessarily
              depends on a close collaboration in their various institutions.     The study
              will integrate the various biostratigraphies through application of Shaw's
              method of graphic correlation modified to weight evolutionary appearance of
              taxa more strongly in developing a composite section for the Lower Devonian
              (lochkovian-Pragian) that may be used for chronostratigraphic interpretation
              within the interval.   Most stratigraphic problems depend fundamentally on
              being able to assign relative ages to the strata being studied.  This project
              will seek to set up a globally useful standard of comparison for
              biostratigraphic work and relative age dating in the Lochkovian-Pragian
              interval.  This is now possible because of the present data base and
              circumstances of key personnel.
