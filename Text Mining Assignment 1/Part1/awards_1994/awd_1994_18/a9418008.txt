Abstract    :
              9418008  Cashman  Processes of volatile exsolution and gas expansion strongly 
              influence eruptive styles of volcanoes.  For this reason,  rates and mechanisms
              of magmatic vesiculation have long been  a fundamental question in volcanology.
               The relationship  between pumice clast vesicularity, vesicle structure, 
              permeability, and eruptive style will be determined by (1)  making detailed
              structural measurements of pumice clasts;  (2) developing techniques for
              determination of pumice  permeability in both the solid and the liquid state,
              and (3)  making experimental measurements of rates of bubble  coalescence
              through use of a microscope-based heating stage  and video recorder.  This work
              will provide critical new  data that are necessary input to rapidly-developing
              models  of magma ascent, fallout of tephra eruption columns and  magmatic
              fragmentation.
