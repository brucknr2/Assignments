Abstract    :
              9418812  Anandan    This three-year award will support U.S.-U.K. cooperative
              research in  theoretical physics between Jeeva Anandan of the University of
              South  Carolina and Roger Penrose of the Mathematical Institute, University  of
              Oxford.  The objective of their research is to study a possible  connection
              between quantum mechanics and gravity.  They will  investigate unsolved
              problems in quantum state reduction using  quantum gravity, and will study the
              incorporation of gravity into the  geometry of quantum theory in Hilbert space.
               Theoretical and  experimental implications of quantum state reduction in 
              superconductors and molecular interferometry experiments will also  be
              investigated.    Dr. Anandan brings to this collaboration his expertise in
              quantum  geometry, foundations of quantum theory, general relativity, and their
               relationship to each other.  This is complemented by the considerable 
              experience and expertise of Dr. Penrose in general relativity and the  geometry
              of space-time and quantum gravity.  The project will  advance understanding of
              the relationship between gravity and  quantum mechanics and will have important
              applications in subfields  in physics, astronomy, and chemistry.  ***
