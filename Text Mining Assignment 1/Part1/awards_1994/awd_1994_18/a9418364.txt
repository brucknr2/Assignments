Abstract    :
              9418364  Kroenke    This project provides funding for an evaluator to study the 
              industry/university interactions occurring in the University of New  Mexico's
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Micro-  Engineered
              Ceramics.  The Center continues to meet the renewal  criteria to remain in the
              Industry/University Cooperative Research  Centers Program.    The evaluator has
              the experience necessary to perform the study.    The Program Manager
              recommends Dr. William Kroenke be awarded  $24,000 for three years for this
              evaluation study.
