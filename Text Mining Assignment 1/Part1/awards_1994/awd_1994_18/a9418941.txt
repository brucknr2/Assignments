Abstract    :
              9418941  Ganguly  The research supported by this award represents a continuing
              effort to determine the energetic properties of ferromagnesian silicates and to
              use these data to constrain the thermal and dynamic histories of terrestrial
              rocks and meteorites.  The research will (1) extend previous work on
              multicomponent diffusion in (Fe, Mg, Ca, Mn) garnet to lower temperatures and
              into previously unexplored compositional space, (2) investigate the edfect of
              H2O on the diffusion of divalent cations in garnet, (3) determine Sm3+ tracer
              diffusion in garnet, and (4) continue collaborative experimental and modelling
              work on Fe2+-Mg interdiffusion in clinopyroxene.
