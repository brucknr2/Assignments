Abstract    :
              9418203  Wintsch       Terrane assembly and metamorphism are common events in
              most  orogenic belts, and the well studied New England orogen is no  exception.
               However, there is a fundamental difference in the  tectono-metamorphic
              histories of western and eastern New England.   In the west, terranes were
              assembled prior to, or during loading  and metamorphism as metamorphic isograds
              are not displaced by  terrane boundaries.  In southeastern New England, on the
              other  hand, the terranes were metamorphosed prior to assembly and  evidence is
              mounting that find assembly occurred in the  Alleghanian.  The broarder
              significance of the difference is not  clear, partly because of a large data
              gap in eastern New England.   This project involves thermochronlogic study of
              eastern  lithotectonic terranes in this data gap to determine if significant 
              post-Metamorphic faulting occurred during the assembly of terranes  in all of
              eastern New England, and what factors are responsible for  the resulting
              pattern.  Results will help unravel the timing of  metamorphism and terrane
              juxtaposition for New England, which  should be of interest in other, less well
              known, orogens.
