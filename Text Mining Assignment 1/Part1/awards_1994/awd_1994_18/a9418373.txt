Abstract    :
              9418373  Leubecker  The Marine Board of the National Research Council's (NRC) 
              Commission on Engineering and Technical Systems serves the  national interest
              by providing, as a result of requests from  sponsoring agencies, or on its own
              initiative, evaluations  and advice concerning ocean developments and uses and
              the  nation's ability to meet its marine and maritime goals.  The  Board
              considers questions of the relation of engineering and  technology to coastal
              and offshore resource development and  operations; to navigation and the
              commerce of the sea,  waterways, and ports; to related human resources and
              onshore  activities; and their relation to the establishment and 
              implementation of public policies.  The Board identifies  opportunities and
              needs for new technologies and other  developments and recommends appropriate
              actions.  It  stimulates the exchange of information and cooperative 
              activities, and provides a forum for the national and  international
              professional community.    The activities through which the Board accomplishes
              its  program are:  (1) assessments of the technical capability to  undertake
              and manage offshore and maritime developments and  uses, including the adequacy
              of knowledge to support  technology development; (2) evaluations of safety of 
              personnel and of the environment; (3) assistance in the  preparation and
              assessment of the government's program  directed to ocean and maritime
              developments and uses; and  (4) identification of future opportunities for the 
              integration of advanced technology into marine or maritime  systems and the
              influence of technical advances on the  establishment and implementation of
              public policy.  ***
