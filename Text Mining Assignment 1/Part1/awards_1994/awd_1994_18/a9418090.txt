Abstract    :
              9418090  Veblen  The proposed work will involve applications of transmission 
              electron microscopy and ancillary techniques to problems  important in the
              fields of petrology, geochemistry,  geophysics, and environmental mineralogy. 
              The underlying  thread of the research is to understand the crystal  chemistry
              of minerals and their reactions at the sub-  nanometer scale.  Topics to be
              explored include: in situ  variable-temperature studies of the C2/c - P21/c
              phase  transition in monoclinic pyroxene, the structural state of  excess Ca in
              monoclinic pyroxenes,  mixed layer illite-  smectite and defect structures of
              mixed layer chlorites-  serpentines, structural and chemical changes in
              thermally  heated asbestos, time series studies of tremolite and other 
              amphiboles during synthesis, quench products from high  pressure DAC
              experiments of high-pressure peridotite, and  mosaic-equilibrium domain size of
              layer silicates as a  function of prograde, low temperature metamorphism.
