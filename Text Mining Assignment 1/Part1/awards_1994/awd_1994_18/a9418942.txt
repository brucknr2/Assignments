Abstract    :
              9418942  Wiens      This research is to test hypotheses about the faulting
              mechanism of deep earthquakes involving the spatial distribution and source
              parameters of the events.  These models will be tested using hypocenter and
              source mechanism inversion methods and 3-D visualization techniques.  In March
              9, 1994, the largest deep earthquake, M=7.6, in over 20 years occurred beneath
              Tonga where a temporary deployment of PASSCAL broadband seismographs had been
              installed by the Principal Investigator. This data set offers a unique
              opportunity to obtain detailed constraints on the rupture dynamics and
              aftershock pattern of a large deep earthquake.  The results are applicable to
              seismic hazard estimation in regions of plate tectonic subduction such as
              Alaska and the Pacific Northwest.  This research is a component of the National
              Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.  ***  ??
