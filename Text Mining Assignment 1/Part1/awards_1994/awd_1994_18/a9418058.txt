Abstract    :
              9418058  Nelson    This award supports a three-year cooperative research project
              between  Dr. Keith Nelson of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and  Dr.
              Toshirou Tagi of Hokkaido University.  The collaborators will  investigate
              lattice vibrations in crystals near phase transitions, acoustic  waves in
              glass-forming liquids and polymers, and acoustic waves in  polymers and other
              thin films.  The study of phase transitions and  liquid-glass transitions is
              intended to advance our fundamental  understanding of structural rearrangements
              in condensed matter.  The  study of thin films can provide important
              information about adhesion  of films to substrates, and also has immediate
              applications to  noninvasive characterization of films in microelectronics and
              other  industries.    The U.S. group, led by Dr. Nelson, has developed
              picosecond and  femtosecond time-domain light scattering methods for study of 
              acoustic and optic phonons in condensed matter.  Of particular  interest for
              the Japanese group, led by Dr. Yagi, is the use of  femtosecond time-resolved
              methods for the study of phase transitions  in an important class of crystals
              whose nonlinear optical properties are  widely exploited in practical devices. 
              The mutual benefits of the  collaboration will be two-way technology transfer
              for the significant  enhancement of both groups  experimental capabilities,
              intellectual  exchange concerning the related topics of interest to both
              groups, and  collaborative experimental results on structural phase transitions
              in  two important classes of materials.  ***
