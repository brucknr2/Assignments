Abstract    :
              9418213  Schwartz   This award provides one-half the funding required for the
              acquisition of equipment to upgrade the computing capabilities in the Institute
              of Tectonics at the University of California-Santa Cruz. The institution is
              committed to providing the remaining funds needed to acquire the equipment. The
              equipment upgrade will be used primarily by the earthquake seismology research
              group of the Institute of Tectonics, currently consisting of three professors,
              three research scientists, five postdoctoral fellows, and nine graduate
              students. The research program in seismology at UC-Santa Cruz encompasses both
              studies in Earth structure and studies of earthquakes and other sources of
              seismic waves such as underground nuclear explosions. The research of the group
              includes processing of very large data sets and executing computer codes with
              large memory requirements.  ***
