Abstract    :
              Proposal Number:  IBN-9418641  Principal Investigator:  Cheryl Sisk    This
              award is to provide a high-resolution epifluorescence microscope for research
              neuroendocrinologists at Michigan State University.  High-resultion
              fluorescence microscopy will be used to localize biological molecules to
              specific subcompartments of individual cells within particular areas of the
              nervous system.  These molecules are tagged with fluorescent markers that show
              particular colors under ultraviolet light.  That way different molecules can be
              tagged with different colors to determine, for example, if a particular pair of
              molecules occur together or separately inside specific cells.  These scientists
              will use the microscope for concurrent detection of activity-dependent markers
              and steroid receptor proteins, for comparisons of enzyme expression patterns in
              mast cells and glia, and for colocalization of neuropeptides and
              neurotransmitters in different regions of the brain.  Furthermore, this
              technique can be used to determine how the distribution of these molecules
              changes when the animal is involved in different behaviors or, for example, is
              subjected to different photoperiods such as those that occur with the seasons. 
              This microscope will also be equipped with a teaching head so that the
              scientists can use the microscope for teaching undergraduates these
              state-of-the-art histological and immunocytochemical techniques.
