Abstract    :
              9418975  Lawton  This award deals with the PR5K gene from Arabidopsis  thaliana
              which encodes a novel receptor with structural  features related to plant
              defense proteins.  The kinase  domain of PR5K is presumed to be involved in
              cytoplasmic  signal transduction.  The extracellular domain is closely  related
              to a group of antimicrobial proteins that includes  the pathogenesis protein
              PR-5, osmotin, thaumatin and a  bifunctional inhibitor of maize.  By analogy
              with other  receptor kinases, this domain is the predicted binding site  for a
              polypeptide ligand.  The structural relationship  between the extracellular
              domain of PR5K and known  pathogenesis-related proteins suggests a possible
              functional  relationship in the expression of the defense response.  Thus,
              cellular targets of antimicrobial proteins such as PR5  might also serve as
              ligands for activation of the PR5K  receptor.  A close structural relationship
              is also seen for  the secreted and kinase-linked forms of the S-locus 
              glycoproteins of Brassica and these molecules have been  proposed to form a
              functional unit that specifies self-  incompatibility during pistil-pollen
              interactions.  This  proposal is concerned with characterizing the PR5K
              receptor  and dissecting its possible role in the perception of plant  defense
              signals.
