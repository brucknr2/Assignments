Abstract    :
              9418251  Knapp           This award supports US collaboration with European and
              Russian  colleagues in the acquisition and analysis of a 500km seismic 
              reflection profile across the Uralian orogen in central Russia.   The proposed
              transect through the southern Urals extends from the  East European platform in
              the Uralian foreland to the West Siberian  basin, crossing the Bashkirian
              foreland fold and thrust belt, the  Kraka ophiolite, the Main Uralian fault
              (suture zone), a collage of  oceanic and microcontinental terranes in the
              hinterland, and the  main axis of orogenic magmatism.  The data to be acquired
              will  provide the first complete seismic image of the crustal and upper  mantle
              architecture of an intact Paleozoic orogen, and contribute  potentially
              fundamental new insight into the processes of  continental collision and
              subsequent orogenic evolution.         Project URSEIS (Urals Reflection Seismic
              Experiment and  Integrated Studies) represents an international collaboration
              of  unprecedentd scale in deep seismic profiling.  The US contribution 
              leverages a larger EUROPROBE outlay, principally from DEKORP  (Germany) and
              ROSCOMNEDRA (Russian Committee for Geophysics and  Deep Drilling).  The program
              derives from two years of planning,  including evaluation of existing Russian
              geophysical and geological  data for the Urals, and follows a successful
              multi-national pilot  survey in 1993.  ***
