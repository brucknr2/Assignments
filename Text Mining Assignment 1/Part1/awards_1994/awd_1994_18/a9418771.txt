Abstract    :
              9418771  Bodycomb    This award supports a 12-month Japan Society  for the
              Promotion of Science Postdoctoral  Fellowship for Dr. Jeffrey Bodycomb,
              Department  of Materials Science and Engineering, Rutgers  University, at the
              University of Kyoto, Japan.   Dr. Bodycomb will work with Dr. Takeji  Hashimoto
              in the Division of Polymer Chemistry,  on a research project entitled,
              "Temperature  Dependence of Phase and Morphology Transitions  of Diblock
              Copolymer/Homopolymer Blends."    This research will study the effect of 
              temperature and homopolymer concentration on  the behavior of diblock
              copolymer/homopolymer  blends.  Such a study will be important in  driving
              theoretical work in this field,  assessing the importance of temperature in 
              processing these materials, and confirming the  usefulness of temperature in
              controlling the  structure of these materials.  Dr. Hashimoto is  a
              world-leader in studying the behavior of  block copolymer/homopolyner blends. 
              At Kyoto  University  Dr. Bodycomb will utilize state-of-  the-art equipment
              including a small-angle x-ray  and TEM.    ***
