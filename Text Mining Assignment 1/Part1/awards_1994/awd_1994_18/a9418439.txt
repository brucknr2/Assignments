Abstract    :
              Jordan  9418439  The project's goal is to increase the understanding of the
              earth's upper mantle and transitin zone through an integrated, quantitative
              analysis of seismological and mineralogical data.  The seismic data sets will
              include the frequency-dependent travel times of direct and multiply reflected
              shear waves,  surface waves, and higher modes on vertical, radial, and
              transverse seismograms, as well as mantle reflectivity profiles obtained from
              horizontally polarized ScS reverberations.  The latter will allow tight
              constraints to be placed on the existance, location, and impedance contrasts
              across upper-mantle discontinuities.  The seismological data from each corridor
              will be inverted for a path-averaged, anisotropic earth model subject to
              different sets of mineralogical constraints.  These constraints will be
              generated by self-consistent mineralogical modeling of upper-mantle structure
              assuming hypothetical compositions and phase relations, and then tested for
              consistency with the seismic data.  Among the hypotheses to be examined are
              competing compositional models (e.g., pyrolite vs. piclogite), the hypothesis
              of chemical homogeneity, and mechanisms for polarization anisotropy.  ****
