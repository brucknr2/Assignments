Abstract    :
              9418682  Merritts       This project will study the active tectonics of the 
              Mendocino triple junction in northern California.  Many of  the faults in this
              part of coastal California are poorly  documented and understood, and this
              study will map them,  conduct geodetic surveying, analyse the Quaternary 
              deformation and analyse seismicity patterns.  Results from  the fieldwork will
              be incorporated into computer models that  will test competing hypotheses about
              the tectonics of this  region.  The results will further our understanding of
              plate  tectonic processes and earthquake hazards in actively  deforming regions
              of  the earth s crust.
