Abstract    :
              Bukowinski  9418356  Density functional theory will be used to develop self
              consisten ab initio models of the response of deformable ions to crystal
              environments.  Spherical and non-spherical deformations will be included, as
              well as the effects of dynamic polarizability and long-ranged van der Waals
              interactions.  The model will include, as qpecial cases, current electron-gas
              potential theories.  A detailed comparative study of existing models, as
              applied to mantle minerals composed of SiO2, MgO, CaO, and Al2O3, will be
              carried out to inform the development of the above extensions.  The fully
              developed models will then be used to examine the static and dynamic properties
              of the same family of minerals, and to explore, with the help of Monte Carlo
              and simulated annealing techniques, mineral structures that may form at
              intermediate and very high pressures, and high temperatures.  The work will
              lead to a better understanding of possible sources of radial discontinuities
              deep in the lower mantle, and of thermal, structural and chemical effects on
              seismic velocities.  ****
