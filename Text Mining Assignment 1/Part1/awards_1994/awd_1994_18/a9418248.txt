Abstract    :
              9418248  Davis      This research is to study the core-mantle boundary by means
              of seismic array analysis.  The new methods to be used include the directional
              determination ability of arrays and signal processing techniques developed in
              the RADAR community.  Data from several seismic arrays throughout the world
              will be used to explore the topography and reflective properties of the
              core-mantle boundary, which is a key feature in the development of competing
              mantle convection models.  The results of this study will be compared with
              earlier tomographic work based upon travel-time analysis alone.  ***  ??
