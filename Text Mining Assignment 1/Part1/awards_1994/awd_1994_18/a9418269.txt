Abstract    :
                  9418269  Leavitt    This research is based on the assumption that changes in
               atmospheric CO2 concentrations over the past 40,000 years can be 
              quantitatively measured by determining the stomatal density and  stable-carbon
              isotope composition of modern and ancient plant  leaves, particularly leaves
              preserved in packrat middens in the  western U.S.  To overcome the problem of
              separate effects of  climate and CO2, PI intends to employ analog approach by
              using  leaves from different latitudes  and/or elevations to maintain  constant
              climate.  Samples from the same latitude but different  ages and elevations
              will allow determination of whether attitudinal  gradients in stomatal density
              and carbon isotopes are the same in  high and low CO2 periods.  Ground truthing
              will be through analysis  of modern living samples and herbarium samples. 
              Possible  implications of the research include determination of the relative 
              effects of CO2 concentrations and climate influences on vegetation  change,
              refinement of carbon cycle and hydrological models during  deglaciation,
              confirmation of CO2 and carbon isotope shifts  identified in earlier studies,
              and enhanced understanding of CO2  variations in the evolution and distribution
              of C4 plant.
