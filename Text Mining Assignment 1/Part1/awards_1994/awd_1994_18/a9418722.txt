Abstract    :
                    Peter Tolias                                          IBN#9418722         
              Single stranded (ss) DNA and RNA-binding proteins encompass  a subset of
              molecules that play significant roles in Drosophila  development.  The
              developmentally regulated shuttle craft (stc)  gene encodes such a protein. The
              main objective of this proposal is  to determine the functional role of STC
              protein in egg chambers and  embryos using a combination of cell biological,
              molecular and  genetic approaches.   The PI in the course of this award will: 
              1) clone and sequence the two existing EMS-induced stc alleles and  the
              Drosophila virilis stc gene to identify essential and conserved  structural
              motifs, 2) use the new FLP-FRT recombination system to  generate marked mutant
              clones that have lost function, and 3).  determine whether stc protein is
              differentially processed.  The  human homologue to stc has recently been
              reported.  It is NF-X1, a  gamma interferon-inducible human transaription
              factor.  The  identification of this homolog will help the PI to distinguish 
              important structural motifs in the shuttle craft protein and  identify its
              targets.  The PI has also identified that one of his  stc mutants has CNS
              defects in late embryonic development that  appear to be defects in axonal
              guidance; this phenotype will aid  his experimental design.
