Abstract    :
              9418362  Hutchison  This starter grant award to the University of Oregon will 
              support the research of Professor James E. Hutchison. The theme  of the
              research will be the synthesis of functional ion channel  models based on
              polypeptide-supported poly(crown ethers). The  polypeptide serves to align
              stacks of crown ethers that form  the pore. The unique property of this
              ion-channel model is the  ease with which the model's structure can be
              systematically  varied to probe the dependence of ion transport through the 
              channel with the structure of the channel. The channel's inside  diameter, the
              molecular composition of the channel's lining,  the length of the channel, and
              the separation between crown  ethers within the polymer will be varied to give
              structurally  well-defined ion channel models. The nature of the ion  transport
              through these ion channels will be tested by  imbedding them in planar lipid
              bilayers and measuring the ion  fluxes through them as a function of ions in
              solution and  transmembrane potential.    Ion channels selectively mediate
              ionic transport through cell  membranes and play a major role in shaping
              biological  electrical impulses. This research will advance the fundamental 
              understanding of the structure/function relationship.
