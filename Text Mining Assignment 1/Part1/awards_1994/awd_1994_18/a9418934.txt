Abstract    :
              Cohen  9418934  The PI will perform theoretical studies of the high pressure
              properties of candidtate mantle phases in order to better constrain the
              physical properties of the mantle.  Several important and basic questions will
              be addressed, including: 1) thermal effects on predicted and recently veriied
              ferroelastic phase transitin in SiO2 from stishovite to CaCl2 and elastic and
              anelastic properties at the transition; 2) possible high temperature phase
              transitions in McSiO3, 3) behavior of iron in oxides and metal-insulator
              transitions in high pressure oxides, and 4) transport, thermoelastic, and
              anelastic properties of mantle phases.  A combination of the following
              theoretical techniques will be used: a) first-primciples electronic structure
              calculations using the Linearized Augmented Plane Wane (LAPW) method, b) ab
              initio models methods that make assumptions about bonding and ionicity but are
              many orders of magnitude faster than LAPW, c) hybrid "constrained potential
              modles" that correct the ab initio models to give better agreement with the
              first-principles calcuations, d)lattice dynamics, molecular dynamics, and Monte
              Carlo simulation using these potentials to obtain temperature dependent
              properties, and e) a newly developed tight-binding total energy model that
              includes covalent and metallic interactions.  This work will give important
              predictions for geophysics and geochemistry that will aid understanding of the
              evolution and dynamics of the Earth and terrestrial planets.  It will give
              predictions of mineral properties in the experimentally difficult regime of the
              high pressures and tempreatures of the deep Earth.  It will also increase our
              understanding of experimental observations of mineral behavior.  The
              predictions helo guide experimental studies.  Finally, students from high
              school to the post-doctoral level will be trained in scientific, theoretical
              and computational methods.  ****
