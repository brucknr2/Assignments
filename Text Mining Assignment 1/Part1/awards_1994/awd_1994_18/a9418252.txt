Abstract    :
              9418252  Humphreys           In 1995 the Canadian Lithoprobe program plans a
              continental  scale active source expanding spread seismic profile to probe the 
              Archean upper mantle beneath the Alberta Plains, with the midpoint  of the
              probe over the Medicine Hat Block, a crustal block which has  been high
              standing since the Proterozoic.  This DeepProbe profile,  centered near
              Calgary, has a 2500km aperture along the front and  interior of the western
              Cordillera.  The Canadians will shoot into  2 dense receiver spreads, each
              roughly 600km long, extending from  Calgary southward into the US to the
              Colorado-Wyoming border.           This project is a component of a suite of 3
              integrated US  seismic experiments which will complement the Canadian effort, 
              making use of similar experimental methodologies, but addressing  different
              tectonic and geologic problems within the US.  The 3  experiments are: 1) an
              active source expanding spread large-  aperture mantle probe; 2) passive
              teleseismic recording and 3) a  crustal refraction profile.  The wide-range of
              scales examined  permits geodynamic evaluation of a complete crust-mantle
              system.   The US experiments will investigate Phanerozoic asthenosphere and 
              Archean-Proterozoic lithosphere modified by Phanerozoic tectonism  beneath the
              Colorado Plateau/Southern Rocky Mountains.  ***
