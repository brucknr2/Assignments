Abstract    :
              9418834  Dokka       The Mojave block previously considered to be a relatively 
              intact terrane has been shown to be the product of Sevier-aged  thrusting
              followed by Cenozoic extensions and strike-slip faulting.   Most of the major
              tectonic elements responsible for late Mesozoic  and Cenozoic activity have
              been identified, however critical  unstudied processes involved in the
              evolution of the Trans Mojave-  Sierran shear zone and the Eastern California
              shear zone remain.   The project will define the limits of these features to
              understand  the geometry, kinematics and timing of the associated strain.  
              Results will allow construction of a model to palinspastically  restore the
              Mojave Desert region, accounting for all mountain range  scale translations and
              vertical axis rotations.  The model will be  useful in reconciling the response
              of the Southern California  borderland to the plate motions between the Pacific
              and North  American plates.
