Abstract    :
              9418357  Bender  The aim of this proposal is to develop a comprehensive
              technology transfer program for integrating scalable parallel computing into US
              and strategic academic research.  Industry has very little knowledge of, or
              experience with, parallel computing and even in academia, parallel computing
              knowledge and expertise if limited.  The Metacenter Regional Alliance formed by
              this proposal will demonstrate the advantages of parallel processing and how to
              take advantage of this technology.     The Alliance will:    - develop and/or
              convert key industrial and scientific applications to parallel and
              heterogeneous computing environments in collaboration with industrial partners
              and academic users.      - take advantage of the similarities of Alliance
              computing resources and collaborate on code conversion and development projects
              to ease the burden of implementing parallel and heterogeneous computing
              systems.  The Alliance centers have similar Cray Y-MP/C90 and T3D systems of
              differing configurations that will allow users to better match applications
              needs with metacenter resources.  The T3D Showcase Applications will be used as
              a clear demonstration of the value of parallel computing for potential
              industrial users.    - the Alliance will evaluate Infrastructure Development
              needs in terms of the T3D and other parallel environments, data storage
              strategies for parallel computing, and identify industrial applications for
              conversion during years two and three. The results of infrastructure
              development planning will be shared with other HPCC users.    The alliance-wide
              focus on Cray T3D and vector architectures simplifies the sharing of software,
              expertise and training materials and the development of a well-focused,
              critical mass of expertise.
