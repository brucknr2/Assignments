Abstract    :
              9418176  Davidson  We propose to carry out two geological and geochemical
              transects across the volcanic arc of the Kamchatkan Peninsula.  The transects
              are located on different basement terranes, although both are of largely
              oceanic affinity.   Comparison of volcanic rocks of different ages at a given
              location will permit us to study changes in the compositions of magmas through
              time.  Comparison between the transects will allow is to constrain the effects
              of lithospheric modification (contamination, etc.).  Comparison along the
              trends will allow evaluation of subduction-related effects.  The variable depth
              to the Benioff zone along each transect may result in variations in the nature
              and amount of the slab-derived component, and concomitant differences in the
              degree of partial melting.  The occurrence of very primitive lavas and mantle
              xenoliths among the volcanic rocks of the region will help us to better
              understand source compositions and processes.  This study will significantly
              advance our understanding of the magmatism and tectonics of the Kamchatkan arc,
              and of  subduction-related magmatism in general.
