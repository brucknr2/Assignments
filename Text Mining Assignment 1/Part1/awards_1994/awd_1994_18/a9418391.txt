Abstract    :
              9418391  Mount  Genetic analysis of radiation sensitive mutants of Arabidopsis
              will be done. The involved genes will be mapped, both physically and
              genetically. Second site suppressors of the uvh1 and uvh6 will be mapped and
              additional suppressors sought.  The genes of interest will be cloned and
              sequenced. The hypothesis that genetic recombination is an important mechanism
              of radiation resistance in plants will be tested by determining  frequencies of
              spontaneous mitotic and meiotic recombination in two radiation sensitive
              mutants, uvh1 and rad3 by genetic crosses. The type of UV damage repair will be
              analyzed in radiation sensitive mutants in various ways.  %%%  Very little is
              known about mechanisms for repair of DNA damage in plants. They are constantly
              exposed to ultraviolet light in sunlight which damages their DNA and it is
              known that they have unique mechanisms for avoiding and repairing such damage.
              A proven genetic approach will be taken to continue an investigation of  DNA
              repair in Arabidopsis, a model plant. The DNA repair genes from this organism
              will be mapped, cloned, sequenced and analyzed for biochemical function using
              the modern tools of molecular genetics.  ***
