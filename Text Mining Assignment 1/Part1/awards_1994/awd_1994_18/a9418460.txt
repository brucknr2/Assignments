              Rintoul  The activity of many mammalian hormones depends upon an initial
              interaction of the hormone with a receptor on the surface of the target cell. 
              This interaction usually results in the production of multiple intercellular
              signals, which the produce the hormonal effects characteristic of the
              particular hormone and the particular target cell.  Although much is know about
              the mode of action of these intercellular signals, relatively little is known
              about the molecular details involved in the primary hormonal stimulation of
              cell surface receptor.  This is primarily due to the difficulty of working with
              these receptor molecular in there native location, the hydrophobic cell surface
              membrane.  Our aim is to determine how binding of a hormone to the outside of a
              cell can result in the activation of multiple signaling pathways on the inside
              of that cell.  The system used in this proposal has served as model analysis.
              %%% This proposal addresses a basic problem in biology, that is how a cell
              recognizes specific substances around it.  This requires a very precise
              recognition mechanism permitti ng the cell to distinguish between different
              types of nutrients.  In addition, cells must recognize and respond to a variety
              of different external stimuli.  Without such a mechanism of recognition a cell
              would starve or be killed.  This proposal examines the mechanism of cellular
              recognition. ***                           ;
