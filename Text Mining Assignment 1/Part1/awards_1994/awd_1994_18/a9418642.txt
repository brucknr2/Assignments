Abstract    :
              This award is for support for a three year program to  measure stable isotopes
              of hydrogen and oxygen, as well as  their combination, deuterium excess, in ice
              cores and near  surface samples from West Antarctica.   These measurements 
              record the changes in basic parameters such as air  temperature, accumulation
              rates, elevation changes, and  shifts in moisture sources.  The samples are
              being collected  as part of another grant (9316564) for site selection for an 
              eventual deep ice coring program in West Antarctica.   As  part of this
              program, a new high capacity, high precision  oxygen isotope facility will be
              developed.  No field  additional field work is required for this project.
