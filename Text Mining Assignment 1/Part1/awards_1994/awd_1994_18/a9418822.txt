Abstract    :
              9418822  Booker           To understand continental evolution, it is essential
              to study  active collision zones.  The type example of a continent-continent 
              collision is between India and Eurasia which has formed the  Himalaya and the
              Tibetan Plateau.  This plateau is the most  conspicuous and one the most poorly
              understood topographic features  on Earth.  Two mechanisms have been proposed
              for its initial  uplift:  (1) India has underthrust Asia to produce a double
              crust  and (2) Asia has been compressed.  Further uplift in the last 10 MY  has
              been attributed to peeling off and sinking of the lower Tibetan  lithosphere
              and its replacement by warmer, lighter asthenosphere.         In collaboration
              with the Chinese Ministry of Geology and  Mineral Resources (MGMR), the
              University of Washington (UW) and the  Canadian Geology Survey (CGS), will
              carry out a high resolution  magnetotelluric (MT) profile in southern Tibet. 
              This will  complement seismic work along the same transect by MGMR and a U.S. 
              group lead by COCORP.  The UW and CGS will make long period MT  measuresments
              to examine crust, mantle and asthenospheric  structure.  The Chinese will make
              shorter period MT measurements to  constrain the upper-crustal structure.  ***
