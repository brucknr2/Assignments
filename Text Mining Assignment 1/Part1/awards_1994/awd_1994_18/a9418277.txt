Abstract    :
              9418277  Storm  This  Gordon  Research Conference on Solid State Chemistry will
              bring  together  solid  state  chemists and materials research and development 
              scientists  from  around   the   world  with  the  express  purpose  of 
              improving  contact   and  communication  among  industrial, government,  and 
              academic  researchers.  The  topics  and speakers that have been selected are
              at the forefront of the  field  of   solid-state   chemistry  and  range  from 
              solid   state   synthesis   and  characterization  to  topics of high
              technological impact such  as  microporous  solids  and  nonlinear optical
              materials for communications.  This  award  will  provide for the support of
              graduate students and young faculty to give them  an  opportunity  to 
              participate  in discussions  with  leaders  in  the  field  of  solid-state
              chemistry.  ***
