Abstract    :
              Booker  9418401  The PI has suggested that crustal seismicity in the Pugen
              Lowland is largely controlled by the deformation properties of material below
              the volcanic basement and that this sub-volcanic basement may be fluid-bearing
              and hence electrically conductive.  To test this hypothesis he has collected 20
              magnetotelluric (MT) and 10 magnetovariation (MV) sites.  With current funding,
              he expects to collect 5 mare MT sites and 10 more MV sites.  The MT data appear
              consistent with the hypothesis, but higher resolution will be achieved when new
              seismic results are used to provide structural constraints.  When combined with
              earlier data,  the MV data will beused to test whether large-scale
              three-dimensional effects are distorting the interpretation.  Funds will
              support completion of the analysis.  ****
