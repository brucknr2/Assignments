Abstract    :
              9418345  Messina  This Metacenter Regional Alliance (MRA) will provide high
              speed access to advanced HPCC resources, will further the metasupercomputing
              paradigm, will stimulate the use of HPCC and NII technologies in industry and
              education, and will investigate technologies and tools in support of NII
              services.    The Los Angeles Regional Gigabit Environment (LARGE) will
              concentrate on selected academic and industrial partners who can benefit from
              immediate access to the metacenter, and to he resources at Caltech.  A major
              focus will be helping users, especially industrial partners, access the
              computing and communications facilities in the metacenter and Caltech.  The
              industrial partners include both users of high performance computing systems
              and independent software vendors who develop software for such systems.     
              LARGE will provide:    - access to the advanced facilities of the metacenter
              and Caltech, including the scalable I/O initiative  - gigabit speed access
              between Caltech, the San Diego Supercomputing Center, and other MRA partners  -
              expertise on the use of scalable parallel processors for advanced simulation
              and modeling in science, engineering, and industry    Collaborative research
              projects will be carried out with the metacenter on heterogeneous computing
              across high speed, wide area networks, on high performance I/O systems, and on
              adapting software tools, e.g., visualization tools, for use on the metacenter's
              advanced computers to support the functionality of industrial partners.  LARGE
              will contribute to the NII by exploring technologies needed to support NII
              applications, such s high speed, high capacity data storage systems, and
              tele-collaboration environments that operate on low speed and high speed
              connections.
