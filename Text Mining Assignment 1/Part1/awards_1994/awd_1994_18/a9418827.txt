Abstract    :
              Brown  9418827  The PI will continue studies of the physical properties
              (principally the elastic constants and thermal diffusivity) of candidate mantle
              constituents under earth mantle conditions of pressure and temperature. 
              Seismic velocities provide the most highly resolved view of Earth's interior
              and laboratory calibration at high pressure and temperature is essential in
              interpretation of seismic models.  Acquisition of these data will remove the
              current ambiguities associated with uncertain extrapolations to high pressure,
              and thus will provide better constraints on the thermal and compositional state
              of the mantle.  Measurements will be extended to simultaneous high temperature
              and high pressure and studies of high pressure mantle silicate phases will be
              initiated.  ****
