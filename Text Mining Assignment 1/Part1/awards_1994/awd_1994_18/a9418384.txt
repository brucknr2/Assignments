Abstract    :
              9418384  Kimbrough       The Mesozoic to Recent tectonic history of western
              North  America involved subductions, arrival and translations of terranes  due
              to oblique relative plate motions, uplift and sedimentation,  rotation and
              final amalgamations to North America. Within this  framework many discrepancies
              exist between paleomagnetic data and  geologic data concerning amount of origin
              parallel displacement and  the timing of those displacements, as well as
              difference in models  of uplift of batholiths and the fate of this erosion
              products. This  project will focus on syn-orogenic conglomerate shed from the 
              rising peninsular ranges batholiths into forearc basins.  Distinctive geologic
              and geochemical characteristics of the  batholiths will be used to specify
              source areas for the forearc  basins. Results will greatly increase the
              geological basis for  discriminating between "fixist" vs. "mobilist" models for
              orogen-  parallel transport of terranes outboard of the batholiths, and  should
              help tip the scales on several unresloved problems of the  California border
              lands.
