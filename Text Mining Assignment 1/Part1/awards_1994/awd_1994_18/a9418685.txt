Abstract    :
              9418685   Getting  The proposed research will provide high pressure petrologists
              with a method of absolute pressure-temperature calibration that can be utilized
              in laboratories throughout the research community.  The method is based on the
              accurate determination of several intersecting equilibrium boundaries in a gas
              piston cylinder apparatus.  Apparatus in other laboratories are calibrated, in
              both absolute temperature and pressure, by referring equilibrium observations
              in those devices to the PIs' accurately determined boundaries.  The proposed
              research will determine phase equilibria with an absolute pressure and
              temperature accuracy of 1% at pressures between ~1.5 and 3 GPa and between 700
              and 1600  (K.
