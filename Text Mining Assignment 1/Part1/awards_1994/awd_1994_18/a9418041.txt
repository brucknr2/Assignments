Abstract    :
                  Guckenheimer  9418041         In this multidisciplinary project, the
              investigator and his colleagues at Cornell University together with Peck at
              Ithaca College focus upon studies of the stomatogastric ganglion.  This small
              neural network with approximately 30 neurons is a central pattern generator
              that coordinates movement of the gastric mill   and pylorus of crustacea.  The
              investigators construct compartmental models of individual neurons based upon
              experimental measurements and amalgamate these into models for subnetworks. 
              These systems provide a testbed for the development of algorithms to explore
              the bifurcations of dynamical systems.  Particular attention is given to those
              aspects of the systems that involve multiple time scales.         The goal of
              the project is to improve understanding of dynamical processes in biological
              systems, with an emphasis upon neural systems.  The investigators work in a
              multidisciplinary setting, combining experiment and mathematical modeling,
              giving due attention to both mathematics and neuroscience, and ensuring that
              the two interact at all times in the work.  The larger goals are pursued in the
              context of specific qystems, namely the study of a small neural circuit that
              controls rhythmic motions in the   foregut of lobsters.  This model system has
              been chosen for its modest size and accessibility for experimental
              manipulation.  The project aims to understand how neural systems switch among
              motor   patterns and how they regulate these patterns.  ***
