Abstract    :
              9418132  Spilhaus    Pressing national concerns with Global Change and the
              mitigation of  natural hazards are leading to increased importance for research
              on  the environments of the recent geological past.  International 
              collaboration has become essential for the analysis of important  scientific
              problems related to these issues.  This project will  support the participation
              of about 50 key U.S. researchers,  including new-career scholars, at the XIV
              Congress of the  international Union for Quaternary Research (INQUA) in Berlin,
               Germany, August 2-10, 1995.  Owing to its strong multidisciplinary  tradition,
              INQUA has direct relevance to seven programs within NSF.  The scientific
              contacts achieved at this meeting and the related  scientific field excursions
              will be invaluable for enhancing  understanding of the dynamic earth system at
              a critical point.  The  habitability of the planet depends of this
              understanding and its  application to real Earth problems within the coming
              decade or so.    A similar travel grant program supported attendance by 32 U.S.
               Quaternary scientists (including ten delegates) at INQUA XIII in  Beijing in
              1991.  The U.S. with a total attendance of 108  scientists made a strong
              showing, especially in the areas of  paleoclimatic modeling, oceanography and
              paleoecology.  Numerous  favorable written reports (available for scrutiny on
              demand) by the  scientists whose travel was subsidized clearly attest to the
              long-  term value of such international meetings and the scientific  contacts
              they foster.
