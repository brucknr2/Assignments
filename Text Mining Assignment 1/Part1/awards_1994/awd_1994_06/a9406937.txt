Abstract    :
              9406937  Unsworth       This experiment is designed to provide direct
              observational  constraints on the distribution of melt and the pattern of 
              upwelling beneath a mid-ocean ridge.  Studies of electromagnetic  and seismic
              wave propagation in the mantle with arrays of ocean-  bottom instruments will
              furnish measurements that can be inverted  to find horizontal and vertical
              variations in velocity and  conductivity structure that can be used to test
              theoretical  models of flow.  56 seafloor electromagnetic instruments will be 
              deployed for one year at 17 degrees south on the East Pacific  Rise.  ***
