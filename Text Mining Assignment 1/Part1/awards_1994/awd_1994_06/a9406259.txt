Abstract    :
              9406259  Ruiz  We propose to assess the effects of deuteric and  hydrothermal
              fluids in PGE mineralization by using Os  isotopes as a monitor of crustal
              interactions in the system.  Bulk analyses by negative ionization mass
              spectrometry  (NTIMS) will be performed on country rocks and crustal 
              xenoliths, as possible representatives of the crustal  component in the
              Bushveld.  Re-Os analysis of PGE-enriched  layers and adjacent silicates will
              also be obtained;  preliminary results by inductively coupled plasma mass 
              spectrometry (ICP-MS) show heterogeneities in these  horizons, particularly
              where deuteric and hydrothermal  effects are evident.  But in situ Os isotope
              and PGE  analysis of PGE phases by laser ablation ICP-MS are required  to
              document the various inputs of these processes.  The data  obtained in this
              study will allow us to place some  constraints on the magmatic, deuteric and
              hydrothermal  contributions to PGE mineralization in the Bushveld Complex.
