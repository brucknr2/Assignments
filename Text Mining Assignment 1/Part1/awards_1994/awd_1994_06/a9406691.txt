Abstract    :
              9406691  Wakimoto  The chromosomes of higher eukaryotes are comprised of two
              cytologically distinct domains known as euchromatin and heterochromatin. These
              regions differ in the extent of condensation, with heterochromatin remaining
              tightly condensed throughout the cell cycle.The structure and function of
              heterochromatin will be examined through the study of a set of genes that
              reside within the heterochromatin on the left arm of Chromosome 2 (2LH) of
              Drosophila melanogaster. Specific repetitive DNAs isolated from 2LH will be
              tested for the ability to confer the properties of heterochromatin and will be
              assayed for effects on chromosome morphology, heterochromatic and euchromatic
              gene expression and gene dosage using germline transformation and chromosome
              rearrangements.  %%%  The long range objective of the proposed project is to
              define the molecular determinants of higher order chromosome structure and the
              functional significance of heterochromatin. The structure and function of
              heterochromatin will be examined by inserting heterochromatic repetitive DNA
              sequences into the genome of the fruit fly and assaying for effects on
              morphology, gene expression and gene dosage.  ***
