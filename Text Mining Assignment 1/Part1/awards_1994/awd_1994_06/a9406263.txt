Abstract    :
              9406263  Brantley       PI will investigate rates of weathering reactions and
              mineral-  derived nutrient cycling within a well-instrumented site in a 
              humid-tropical climate in the Luquillo Mountains of Puerto Rico.   This project
              is in collaboration with the U.S. Geological Survey  and takes place on a
              (USGS) WEBB and (NSF) LTER site in the Icacos  watershed.  Understanding rates
              and mechanisms of chemical  weathering is a key to developing global carbon
              dioxide budgets and  resulting global change.  Results will also provide new
              insights  into weathering and biogeochemical cycles in tropical environments, 
              which, though comprising only 25% of the Earth's surface,  contribute almost
              40% of the river ionic load to the world's  oceans.
