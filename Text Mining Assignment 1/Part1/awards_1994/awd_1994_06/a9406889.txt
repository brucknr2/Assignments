Abstract    :
              9406889  Ruckenstein    With the discovery of conductive polymers, the
              possibility to combine the versatility of polymers with the electrical
              properties of metals became possible.  However, the initial conductive polymers
              were insoluble and infusible and thus not processable, and had poor mechanical
              properties, being brittle.  In this proposal an extremely simple procedure is
              suggested to prepare conductive composite materials.  The procedure is so
              simple, that it may acquire industrial significance.  For a composite polymer
              formed of a conductive polymer, which is responsible for the conductivity, and
              a host polymer, which is responsible for the mechanical properties, to have
              good electrical and mechanical characteristics, the two components must be
              mixed very uniformly.  The present ensures the uniform oxidation of pyrrol, and
              hence a uniform distribution of polypyrrol in the host polymer.    Electrified
              conductivity, mechanical properties and morphology will be determined for the
              resulting materials.   We expect to develop a procedure for the preparation of
              a composite polymer which will have a good electrical conductivity > 1S/cm and
              good mechanical properties.  The selection of the host polymer and of the
              surfactant which will be employed to obtain the oxidative solution are
              extremely important.  ***
