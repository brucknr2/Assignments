Abstract    :
              9406238  Green      The PIs will perform a detailed series of experiments on
              rocks of  mid-lower crustal composition to determine their rheologies and the 
              role of partial melting in creep.  The PIs will also investigate  the effects
              of deformation on the distribution of melt within the  rocks.  ****
