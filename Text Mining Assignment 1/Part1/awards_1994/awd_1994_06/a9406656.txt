Abstract    :
              9406656  Bullesbach  Structurally related proteo-hormones of the insulin family
              consist  of the parent hormone insulin, the hormone of pregnancy relaxin,  and
              invertebrate developmental factors (i.e, bombyxin, isolated  from the brains of
              the silk worm) and growth factors (i,e.,  molluscan insulin-related peptide,
              isolated from the pond snail).   The wide variety of biological functions
              inherent in essentially  the same three-dimensional structure implies that the
              biological  function of this family of proteins depends primarily on the side 
              chain distribution.  It is the ultimate aim of this proposal to  find the
              surface features that are crucial for the diverse  biological functions of the
              insulin family of hormones.  The  initial step of this investigation involves
              the chemical synthesis  of these factors and of defined analogs.  The syntheses
              are based  upon a novel approach, the site directed disulfide-bond formation, 
              which has been highly successful in the synthesis of insulin-like  structures. 
              Investigation of the physical chemical and biological  properties of the
              analogs by comparison with natural factors will  give insight into the
              structure-function relationships within this  important family of hormones. 
              The long-term goal of these studies is a better understanding of  the mode of
              action of hormones and the subsequent design and  synthesis of mimetics.  Such
              mimetics of hormones involved in  invertebrate maturation may improve our
              ability to control insects  by environmentally acceptable means, i.e., by
              suppressing or  arresting the development of a specific pest.  ***
