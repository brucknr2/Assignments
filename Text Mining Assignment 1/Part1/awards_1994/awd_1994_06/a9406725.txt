Abstract    :
              9406725  Ramamurthy        Winter storms are among the most life threatening and
               economically disruptive of  meteorological phenomenon.  In a continuation of
              previous research,  the Principal Investigators propose  to study two areas,
              both related to the organization and evolution  of winter time phenomena
              associated  with mid-latitude cyclones.          The first area of research
              concerns research on the genesis,  evolution and structure of  mesoscale
              gravity waves and their associated precipitation bands.   The second research
              thrust is to  study the occlusion process of mid-latitude cyclones.    Both 
              studies will consist of a combination of  diagnostic and numerical modeling
              work.  This research should lead  to an increase in understanding of  the
              evolution of mid-continent winter cyclones and embedded  mesoscale processes
              which exert  important controls over the production of winter time 
              precipitation.  ***
