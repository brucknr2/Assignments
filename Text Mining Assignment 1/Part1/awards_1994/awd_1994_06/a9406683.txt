Abstract    :
              9406683  Brown       This award provides one-half the funding required for  the
              acquisition of an automated heating and freezing stage  to be used for the
              microscopic examination of fluid  inclusions in geological samples. The
              microscope stage will  be used in the Department of Geology and Geophysics at
              the  University of Wisconsin, Madison. The University of  Wisconsin is
              committed to providing the remaining funds  necessary for the acquisition of
              the equipment. The research  of the Principal Investigator, colleagues, and
              students  require accurate and programmable temperature control of  small
              samples under the microscope. The Principal  Investigator's research projects
              focus on the study of fluid  inclusions found in rocks containing gold deposits
              and are  aimed at understanding the chemical and physical processes  that
              operate during the formation of gold deposits.  ***
