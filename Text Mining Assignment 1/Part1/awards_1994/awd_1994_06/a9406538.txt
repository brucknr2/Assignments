Abstract    :
              94-06538  Allred    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
              project addresses production technology for low-cost thermoplastic prepreg
              materials tailored to object-fabrication requirements.  Phase I showed the
              feasibility of producing low-cost thermoplastic, powder-impregnated tows with a
              variety of fibers and polymers.  Cost reduction is achieved through processing
              at high speeds with particle sizes larger than presently used with
              powder-impregnated materials.  In Phase II control parameters will be studied
              for the impregnation process tailored to fabrication by filament winding,
              pultrusion, braiding, weaving, and molding.  Sizings to improve fiber adhesion
              to thermoplastic polymers will also be examined.  Results of these studies will
              be used in design of a large-scale process Phase III demonstration under
              private sector support.    Commercial applications of low-cost thermoplastic
              composite materials are expected in construction, transportation, sporting
              goods, aerospace, marine, chemical, medical, and military industries.
