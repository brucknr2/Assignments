Abstract    :
              9406008  Kovash  Radiative pion and kaon capture experiments will be performed
              on  hydrogen and deuterium targets at TRIUMF and the Brookhaven  National Lab's
              AGS facility, respectively.  The goals are to  obtain low energy properties of
              the neutron-neutron interaction  and the hyperon-nucleon interactions.  In
              addition, pion capture  followed by electron-positron emission will be
              measured.  This  will provide information of the pion and nucleon form factors,
               both of fundamental interest.  ***
