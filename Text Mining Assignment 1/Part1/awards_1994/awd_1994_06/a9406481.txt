Abstract    :
                   This is the first year of a three-year continuing award.  The  research
              addresses the continuation of exploration of the use of  deictic models and
              pointing strategies for constructing goal-  directed sensory-motor behaviors
              that are far more succinct than  classical methods, and exploration of
              trial-and-error learning of  these behaviors.  The investigation involves
              deictic modeling of  visual routines, in which realistic fixation routines are
              developed  that can work with grayscale images, leading to visual behaviors 
              that have the flexibility to take advantage of task context;  deictic modeling
              of short-term memory that allows routines to use  local memory; modeling of
              modular task scheduling that supports the  production of complex visual
              behaviors involving multiple goals  from simpler behavioral routines; and a
              deictic model of hand-eye  control via teleassistance, in which humans are able
              to assist a  robot in performing some of the more difficult control functions
              in  a complex task.
