Abstract    :
              9406062  Cheney       Laser Argon dating studies have established that
              substantial  age variations occur within single muscovite crystals as a
              function  of thermal history, size, and post-crystallization deformation.   The
              core-to-rim age discordance of these crystals can have  significant
              applications in studies of crustal development.  This  project will use the
              well-studied southwestern New England area as  a field test area to develop a
              robust methodology for  interpretation of such spectra.  Successful results
              will have wide  application to tectonic studies.
