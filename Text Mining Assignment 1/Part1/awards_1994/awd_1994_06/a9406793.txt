Abstract    :
                In principle, if an algorithm is given generalized input  (e.g. a  probability
              distribution, a set of values, a list with no  repeats, or  values coupled with
              CPU times)it should produce  correspondingly general output.  The `modular
              semantics` studied  in this project provides formal machinery for a 
              transparent  implementation. For example, given code to produce random 
              outcomes  in {x1,...,xn}, a simple declaration that the ambient  environment is
              to be  probabilistic prior to calling the code  is all that is needed to modify
              the  output from a random single  output to an expression {{p1,x1},...,{pn,xn}}
               wherein pi is the  probability of the outcome xi. The underlying programming 
              system  must be altered so as to replace standard function evaluation  with 
              Kleisli evaluation with respect to a finitary monad in the  category of sets. 
              Universal algebra allows  for a uniform implementation  using tree processing. 
                The primary research  goal is to understand the process by which  code is
              transparently interpreted  relative to a monad. While  existing examples
              demonstrate the viability of the  project, most  of the work remains to be
              done.  A secondary research goal is to  develop creative applications of
              monad-driven algorithms.
