Abstract    :
              INT 9406779  Gordon  Technical Description:  This project provides partial
              support for  Brent Gordon, University of Oklahoma to be a guest scientist  for
              four months at the Tata Institute for Fundamental Research  (TIFR), School of
              Mathematics, Bombay and two months at the  Mehta Research Institute, Allahabad,
              India.  His research area  is arithmetic algebraic geometry.  The specific
              problems to be  investigated focus on questions about algebraic cycles in 
              algebraic-geometric varieties associated with automorphic forms.   One goal of
              the research is to determine the Hodge structure,  and verify the Hodge
              conjecture, for particular special  constituents of these varieties.  A second
              goal is to analyze and  understand the groups of algebraic cycles modulo
              rational  equivalence for some Kuga-Shimura varieties.     Scope:  This project
              will be very beneficial to Prof. Gordon's  research by providing vital contact
              for an extended period with  some exceptional Indian theorists with whom he has
              had limited  contact at meetings and via e-mail.  He anticipates significant 
              interaction with two groups at  TIFR and one group at the new  Mehta Research
              Institute having common interests and expects  that after the necessary
              incubation time specific plans for  collaborations will develop.  Indian
              scientists excel in theoretical  mathematics and many mutual benefits may be
              expected to  result from the interaction.  Project corresponds with INT 
              guidelines by supporting a new activity that benefits a U.S.  scientist.
