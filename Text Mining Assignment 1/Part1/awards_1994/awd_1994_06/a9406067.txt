Abstract    :
              9406067  O'Neil       A newly developed simplified method of oxygen isotope
              analysis  of phosphatic materials will be exploited in a proposed program of 
              interdisciplinary research projects that utilize basic principles  of earth
              sciences, chemistry and biology.  Particular emphasis will  be placed on
              applications of the method to paleoclimatology,  determination of equilibrium
              fractionation factors at low and high  temperatures, biomineralization,
              mechanisms of phosphate-water  interactions, anthropology, and paleontology.   
                 The proposed research program includes, among others, the  following
              projects:  (1) Bacterial synthesis of hydroxyapatite and  fluorapatite with
              determinations of equilibrium fractionations  between H2O and PO4 (dissolved
              and solid) as well as the mechanisms  of the exchange reactions and REE uptake,
              (2) Paleoecology of  Pleistocene cave bears (paleoclimate), (3) Viking
              Settlements in  Greenland during the Little Ice Age (anthropology,
              paleoclimate,  paleodiet), (4) A test of proposed large oxygen isotope
              excursions  in late Devonian oceans from analysis of conodonts, (5) 
              Paleoecology of whales and fishes, and (6) Laboratory calibration  of 18O-
              fractionations between apatite minerals and water at high  temperatures. 
              Samples for all projects are in hand and preliminary  data have been obtained.
