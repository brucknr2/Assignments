Abstract    :
              The proposal is directed at the design and implementation of a VLSI  Gopher. 
              The VLSI Gopher aims at providing an infrastructure to  researchers in VLSI
              Design Automation.  It is expected to provide  the latest pertinent information
              on benchmarks, design layouts,  research papers, university publications,
              proceedings of  conferences, journals in a well organized format for use by the
               research community.
