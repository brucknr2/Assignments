              Columbia University, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory  Title: Derivation and
              Analysis of Climatic Information from Tree  Rings    This award supports
              dendroclimatic research at the Tree-Ring  Laboratory (TRL) at the
              Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.  Analysis  of growth rings of old-aged trees
              provides an almost unique tool  for determining seasonal and year-by-year
              variations of past  climate to evaluate recent climatic changes.  Large-scale 
              reconstructions and local studies show unusual warming in the past  century,
              occasional abrupt climatic changes, and more prevalent  extremes in dry and wet
              events.    The current effort will update and improve the coverage of 
              climatically-sensitive forest-ecotone sites with the addition of  sampling for
              moisture stress variations and inclusion of subfossil  material to extend the
              tree-ring record farther into the past.   This extension is crucial for
              comparison of the present, possibly  anthropogenic, warmer period to natural
              warmer periods of the more  distant past.
