Abstract    :
              9406680     Boggess  This proposal focuses on the application of ultrafast
              optical  techniques, based on a broadly-tunable femtosecond optical  parametric
              oscillator, to the measurement of hot carrier  relaxation, optical
              nonlinearities, and carrier transport in  GaInAsSb/A1GaAsSb quantum wells and
              related ternary and binary  heterostructures.  The extent to which band
              structure engineering,  through both strain and quantum confinement, influences
              these  properties will be explored.  Pump-probe spectroscopy, transient 
              grating techniques, and time-resolved photoluminescence  upconversion
              techniques will all be employed.  The semiconductor  samples to be used in this
              research will be provided by The Hughes  Research Laboratories (HRL) as part of
              a long-standing, broadly-  based collaborative program.  While the ultimate
              goal of these  studies is to enhance the knowledge base required to improve
              mid-IR  optical and optoelectronic devices, it is emphasized that the  proposed
              measurements will provide information related to the  fundamental physics of
              this largely unstudied materials system.   Specifically, these measurements
              will provide insight into carrier  energy relaxation through both inter- and
              intravalley electron-  phonon scattering, the relationship between the
              engineered band  structures and nonlinear susceptibilities, which in turn are 
              related to dipole transition matrices and energy band separations,  and the
              fundamental scattering processes that determine the nature  of both in-well and
              cross-well carrier transport in Sb-based  multiple quantum wells and
              superlattices.  ***
