              will purchase equipment which will be dedicated to  the support of research in
              the mathematical sciences.  The  equipment will be used for several research
              projects,  including in particular: development of the multiple marker  sib
              pair linkage test, statistical methods for quality and  productivity,
              nonparametric inference, isotonic regression,  and computing in Bayesian Gibbs
              sampling and supersaturated  designs.
