Abstract    :
              9406751  Antoy  The object of this project is to develop the theory and 
              applications of a narrowing strategy that extends the recently  discovered
              notion of needed narrowing for inductively sequential  systems to constructor
              based strongly sequential and weakly  orthogonal systems.    Needed narrowing
              will be implemented as it applies to functional  logic languages for a
              prototypical and portable integration of  function and predicates.  The
              efficiency of this implementation  will be compared with that of other
              implementations of narrowing  previously proposed for the same purpose.  ***
