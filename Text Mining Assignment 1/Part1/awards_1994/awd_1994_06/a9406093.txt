Abstract    :
              9406093  Rose  This long term research program has focused on active  volcanoes,
              their emissions to earth's atmosphere and the  mitigation of their hazards.  In
              the next three years the  principal focus of work will be on the systematic
              refinement  of a new radiative transfer model for remote satellite  sensing of
              the ash burdens in drifting volcanic clouds, the  verification of the technique
              by means of actual sampling of  volcanic cloud particles and by experiments in
              the  laboratory and the application of the technique to a data  archive of
              volcanic clouds spanning the last 13 years.  The  work will help us understand
              how much fine volcanic ash is  produced in eruptions and how this ash is
              removed from the  atmosphere.
