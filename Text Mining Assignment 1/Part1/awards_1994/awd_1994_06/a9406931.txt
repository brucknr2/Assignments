Abstract    :
              This research explores test methods for manufacturing test of CMOS  integrated
              circuit (IC) chips based on monitoring of the dynamic  portion of the power
              supply current (iDDT).  Since an iDDT pulse is  created any time a CMOS circuit
              switches states, the monitoring of  iDDT provides observability into the
              switching behavior of the  circuit.  This, combined with standard test methods,
              can provide  improved testability of manufactured IC chips.  New accurate fault
               models based on actual physical tests as opposed to simulation  alone, and new
              design methods for enhancing iDDT-testability are  being investigated.  The
              methods are being incorporated into a  design-for-testability tool, and are
              being evaluated on real  designs.
