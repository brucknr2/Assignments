              California,San Diego  Title: Interanual, Interdecadal, and Centennial Climate
              Variability  in the Eastern North Pacific Over the Past 2000 Years    The Santa
              Barbara Basin is becoming increasingly important as a  paleoclimate resource. 
              The annual microfaunal and isotopic record  in the Santa Barbara Basin provides
              an opportunity to reconstruct  the late Holocene climate over one of the
              important teleconnection  centers of the northern hemisphere.  The records
              appear to be  proxies for temperature and possibly other large-scale parameters
               of the region.  This award supports a three-part project to  include: (A)
              develop the annual biological records preserved in the  Santa Barbara Basin as
              proxies for the instrumental climate record;  (B) a model will be constructed
              of the North Pacific temperature  and circulation over the instrumental record,
              approximately 1900-  present; (C) using this model, the longer history
              preserved in the  Santa Barbara Basin fossil record will be sampled in order to
               reconstruct the regional climate over the past 2000 years.  This  research is
              an interdisciplinary project involving the Marine Life  Research Group and the
              Climate Research Division of the Scripps  Institution of Oceanography.
