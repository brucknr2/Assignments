Abstract    :
              9406788  Schaefer       This award continues support for the Southeastern -
              Atlantic  Regional Conferences on Differential Equations.  The series of 
              conferences has been held yearly since 1981, at a host university  in the
              geographical region.  These conference bring together  established and new
              researchers and advanced graduate students  for an exchange of ideas and
              discussions on the diverse aspects  of differential equations. The talks are
              built around addresses  of three principal speakers of outstanding scientific
              reputation,  selected by a steering committee from representative 
              universities.  This year the speakers will be Professors L.  Pamela
              Cook-Ioaniddis, University of Delaware, Frank W. J. Olver,  University of
              Maryland and James B. Serrin, University of  Minnesota.  The primary purpose of
              the conferences is to promote  research and education in the field of
              differential equations,  i.e., ordinary and partial differential equations and
              functional  differential equations, numerical techniques and their 
              applications to biology, engineering and physics.  Conferences  are scheduled
              to run for two days each fall.   ***
