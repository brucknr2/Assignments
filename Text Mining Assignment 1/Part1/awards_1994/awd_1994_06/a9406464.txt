Abstract    :
              This research involves a broad investigation of membrane fouling by
              macromolecules.  Principal factors causing fouling include concentration
              polarization, plugging, adsorption of macromolecules on the surfaces in the
              membrane, and macromolecular/aggregate deposition on the upper surface of the
              membrane with emphasis in this study on the latter two.  Fouling of several
              varieties of membranes with different pore sizes and geometries and with
              different chemical natures (e.g. PTFE, PES, ceramic) will be investigated for a
              series of well-characterized proteins over a wide range of conditions.  A
              primary goal of the work is to develop a better understanding of intermolecular
              interactions which lead to aggregate formation and its role in protein fouling.
               Other experiments are directed to the evaluation of various cleaning
              procedures.    Fouling adversely affects the length of service of membranes in
              the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries.
