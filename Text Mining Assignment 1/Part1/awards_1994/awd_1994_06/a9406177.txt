Abstract    :
              9406177  Grove  The proposed research involves experimental, field and 
              theoretical studies aimed at understanding the processes and  conditions that
              lead to the formation and chemical evolution  of subduction zone magmas.  The
              proposed experimental  studies consist of (1) a series of elevated (1 to 3 GPa)
               experiments that would investigate the effects of variable  amounts of H2O
              (between 2 and 6 wt. %) on the compositions  of primary magmas produced from
              partial melting of  peridotite bulk compositions, and (2) a series of H2O 
              bearing experiments under crustal pressure conditions (100  to  300 MPa) on
              natural basalts, andesites, and on basalt-  analog compositions.  A
              complementary program of field  studies would be carried out in the Southern
              Cascade Range  of the U.S.A.  The study will provide fundamental data to 
              develop models of arc magma generation, to elucidate  conditions in crustal
              magma reservoirs, and to understand  processes that lead to explosive volcanic
              eruptions.
