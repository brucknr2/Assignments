Abstract    :
              9406074  Harrison       This award provides 51% of the funding necessary to 
              acquire an Inductively-Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission  Spectrometer to be
              installed and operated in the Department  of Geology and Geological Engineering
              at the Colorado School  of Mines. The institution is committed to providing the
               remaining funds needed for the acquisition.       The instrument is to be used
              mainly in the research and  teaching of the Geochemistry Program at the
              Colorado School  of Mines. The Geochemistry Program is an interdisciplinary 
              graduate program, involving three departments and fourteen  faculty and their
              students in research and teaching that  requires multielement chemical analysis
              capabilities for  studies of natural waters, environmental assessment studies, 
              and igneous and sedimentary petrology.  ***
