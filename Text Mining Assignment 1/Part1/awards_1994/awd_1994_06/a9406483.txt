Abstract    :
              9406483  Walker  Paramutation is defined as an interaction between alleles that
              leads to directed heritable change at a locus with high frequency. The
              phenotype is different depending upon which parent transmits the allele. The
              best studied example of paramutation occurs at the R locus of Zea mays. We will
              study this system in corn and analyze both the factors that cause a gene to be
              imprintable and the factors which signal the gene to imprint strongly when next
              transmitted through pollen. The goal of the work is to initiate a molecular
              analysis of paramutation. We will determine whether methylation of the locus
              and decreased production of pigment occur simultaneously and we determine the
              structures at R/r that are responsible for allowing paramutation and imprinting
              to occur.  %%%  Diploid organisms inherit two sets of chromosomes; a maternal
              set and a paternal set. In most cases, both copies of a gene will function or
              not in the same way but in a few known cases, the gene from one parent will be
              expressed and the same gene from the other parent will not be expressed. This
              phenomenon is known as parental imprinting or paramutation. One of the best
              studied examples of paramutation is in corn at a locus named R. We will
              initiate a molecular analysis of this phenomenon in corn and try to determine
              the mechanisms utilized by the plant. Undergraduate students will participate
              in the work. A better understanding of genomic mechanisms will be of importance
              both at the basic and at the applied level.   ***
