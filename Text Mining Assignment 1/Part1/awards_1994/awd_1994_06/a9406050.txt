Abstract    :
              9406050  Baker  CP1 (encoded by the gene CEP1) is a moderately abundant,
              sequence-specific DNA-binding protein of S. cerevisiae.  A member of the
              general regulatory factor family of yeast chromosomal proteins, CP1 is
              multifunctional; it performs roles in chromosome segregation and in regulating
              gene expression.  It is believed that CP1 acts primarily as a local organizer
              of chromatin structure, configuring the DNA into conformations conducive to the
              assembly of kinetochores and active transcription complexes.  To learn more
              about CP1 action, a synthetic lethal genetic analysis of CP1 is being
              undertaken.  Mutations synthetically lethal with cep1 will be isolated and
              complementation groups defined.  The cep1 synthetic lethal mutations (csl's)
              will be classified by phenotype; the mutants will be tested for defects in
              mitotic and meiotic chromosome segregation, defects in transcription,
              synergistic interaction between the csl and a cis-acting centromere mutation,
              perturbations in cell cycle progression, and ability to be rescued by
              partially-active mutant alleles of cep1.  Wild-type genes corresponding to the
              most interesting csl alleles will be isolated from yeast genomic plasmid
              libraries and characterized.  %%%  The long term goal of this research is to
              provide general insights into the biochemical mechanisms that establish
              eukaryotic chromosome structure and effect changes in that structure to meet
              functional needs.  Chromosome structure is an essential element in both the
              regulation of gene expression and the proper distribution of chromosomes at
              cell division.  ***
