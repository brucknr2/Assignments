Abstract    :
              9406305  Hodges       This award provides partial funding for the support of  a
              technician assigned to the solid-source and gas-source  mass spectrometry
              laboratories in the Department of Earth,  Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences at
              the Massachusetts  Institute of Technology.  The laboratories are engaged in 
              ongoing programs of research and graduate education that  require full-time
              technical assistance. Current basic  research projects focus on the use of
              radiometric dating  techniques to interpret large-scale tectonic processes and 
              Earth history.  ***  9405805  Craig       This award provides 75% of the funds
              required for the  acquisition of a microscope system for use with transmitted 
              and reflected light to be used in the rare gas isotope  laboratory, Scripps
              Institution of Oceanography at the  University of California, San Diego. The
              University is  committed to providing the remaining funds necessary for the 
              acquisition.       The microscope system is mainly to be used by  researchers
              working with fluid, glass, and crystalline  inclusions trapped in samples of
              basaltic rocks that have  been extruded from the Earth's mantle. The microscope
              is  needed for the location and identification of these small  inclusions prior
              to extraction of the rare gases (argon,  helium, and neodymium) for isotopic
              analysis. The  researchers at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography are 
              using the isotopic content of the rare gases brought up from  the mantle to
              understand the geochemical evolution of the  mantle.  ***
