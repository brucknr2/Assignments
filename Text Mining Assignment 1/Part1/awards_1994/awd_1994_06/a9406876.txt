Abstract    :
              9406876  Smith  In the fields of nanofabrication, microfabrication, electron and
              ion lithographies, x-ray lithography, particle beam optics, and forefront
              applications of nanofabrication, the International Symposium on Electron, Ion
              and Photon Beams is the premier conference.  At this conference the latest
              research results from groups around the world are usually reported first.  the
              proceedings of the Symposium are published in the Nov/Dec issue of the Journal
              of Vacuum Science and Technology (an American Institute of Physics archival
              journal) provided they pass peer review.  The NSF support of the conference
              will be used to enable graduate student participation in this event.  ***
