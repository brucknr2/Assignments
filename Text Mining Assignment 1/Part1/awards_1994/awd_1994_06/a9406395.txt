Abstract    :
              9306395  Ashley  This workshop will help clarify the utilization of sedimentary 
              geology and paleontology (SG&P) in understanding and resolving  environmental
              and resource challenges in the early 21st century.   Goals are:  1) identify
              future applications of SG&P in terms of  careers and needed skills; 2) identify
              research advances needed to  facilitate the use of SG&P, and formulate a
              strategy for fostering  these advances; 3) provide advice to the (higher and
              continuing)  education communities on anticipated needs in curricula and 
              facilities; 4) develop a strategy for demonstrating the value of  SG&P to
              potential users.
