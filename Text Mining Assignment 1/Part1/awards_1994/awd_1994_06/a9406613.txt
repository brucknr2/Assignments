Abstract    :
              9406613  Fornaess       The Department of Mathematics at the University of 
              Michigan will purchase equipment which will be dedicated to  the support of
              research in the Mathematical Sciences.  The  Department has undertaken several
              projects involving the use  of advanced Unix workstations to     (i)  explore
              Mathematics using computational and  visualization tools; and    (ii)  give
              vigorous computer-assisted proofs.
