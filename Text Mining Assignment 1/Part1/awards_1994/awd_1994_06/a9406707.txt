Abstract    :
              9406707  Sheridan    It is well known that the pancreas produces hormones that 
              regulate such critical processes as metabolism, development,  and growth.  The
              best known pancreatic hormones are insulin  and glucagon.  Recent studies have
              shown the existence of  multiple forms of somatostatin, a peptide hormone
              originally  isolated from the brain and found to inhibit growth hormone 
              release from the pituitary gland, but subsequently found to  be located in the
              pancreas, gastrointestinal tract, and  elsewhere of many animals.  The special
              significance of the  multiple forms of somatostatin and the roles these factors
               play in coordinating aspects of metabolism, growth, and  development remain to
              be determined.  With this project, Dr.  Sheridan will evaluate how somatostatin
              influences, directly  and/or indirectly (via interactions with other pancreatic
               factors such as insulin), lipid metabolism in fish.  Specifically, he will
              determine in what tissues and through  what specific cellular processes
              somatostatin influences fat  uptake and breakdown.  In addition, he will
              distinguish the  actions of two pancreatic somatostatin forms (the co- 
              existence of which is unique to fish).  These results will  contribute
              significantly to the overall understanding of how  metabolism is regulated and
              provide important insight into  the evolution of somatostatin action.  ***
