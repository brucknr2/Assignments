Abstract    :
              9406678  Jarrell  This proposal concerns the simulation of highly correlated 
              electronic systems.  The systems include the high temperature  superconductors,
              heavy Fermion materials and magnetic materials.  The methods to be applied
              involve Quantum Monte Carlo, often  coupled with analytical techniques.  The
              properties on interest  are dynamical response and the models of interest
              include the  Hubbard, Anderson, Holstein and Kondo.  In addition, the effect 
              of magnetic impurities on week localization will be studied as  well as 3D
              disordered correlated systems (via a disordered  Hubbard model with strong
              correlations on a fraction of the  sites).  Also the PI will continue work on
              analytic continuation.  %%%  This proposal concerns the calculation of
              electronic properties  in systems in which the electrons are highly correlated.
               Such  systems include the high temperature superconductors and magnetic 
              materials.  Because these systems are so complex, the effort will  be on the
              understanding of model systems - chosen because they  incorporate most of the
              important physics of a wide class of  materials.  Thus generic behavior may be
              found.  The properties  of interest include transport coefficients (eg
              conductivity),  spectra and the lifetimes of different states of a given
              system.  The methodology involves sophisticated numerical simulation as  well
              as clever techniques to extract information from the numbers  so-found.  This
              proposal represents strategic but fundamental  work in the understanding of the
              basic physics of important  technological materials.  ***
