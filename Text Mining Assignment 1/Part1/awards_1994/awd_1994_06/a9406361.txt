Abstract    :
              9406361  Gallager    Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will undertake an
              ocean  sciences instrument development project to design, construct, and  test
              a moored vertically profiling Video Plankton Recorder (VPR)  that will
              determine the taxonomic and size composition of  zooplankton, along with
              several environmental variables, over time  scales of hours to months.  The
              system is designed around a buoyant  streamlined body containing the VPR and
              associated electronics plus  sensors that will be raised and lowered by a
              bottom-mounted winch.   The winch will allow the VPR to ascent rapidly to the
              surface and  then will pull the system back down slowly while it makes 
              measurements and records data.  The goal is to be able to make up  to 300
              profiles per deployment in depths of up to 100 meters, while  recording a video
              signal from two cameras, plus conductivity,  temperature, depth fluorescence,
              light transmission, and downwellig  irradiance.  Zooplankton and particles
              within the size range of 100  microns to 5 centimeters will be reduced
              digitally and recorded.   The use of such a system in open ocean regions
              represents a cost-  effective way of obtaining long-time series data, compared
              to the  cost of obtaining similar data from a research vessel.
