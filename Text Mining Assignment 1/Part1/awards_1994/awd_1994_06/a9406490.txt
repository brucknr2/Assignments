Abstract    :
               9406490  Brown  This project focuses on factors that control the geochemical 
              behavior of Cr and Se in soils, sediments, and natural  waters particularly
              those affecting their sorption on the  surfaces of common oxide and clay
              minerals.  It integrates  laboratory studies of the surface geochemistry of
              magnetite,  kaolinite, and smectite and the sorption and redox behavior  of Se
              on these minerals and Cr on magnetite with several  ongoing field
              investigations of the environmental  geochemistry of Cr and Se in magnetite-
              and clay-bearing  sediments being conducted by associate investigators from 
              the USGS and LBL.  The objectives of this proposed research  are (1) to define
              quantitatively reaction stoichiometries  and the geometry and composition of
              Cr(III) and Cr(VI)  complexes sorbed on magnetite and of Se(IV) and Se(VI) 
              complexes sorbed on magnetite, kaolinite, and smectite; (2)  to characterize
              the magnetite surface before and after  sorption using various spectroscopic
              and scattering  techniques; (3) to utilize the results of our spectroscopic 
              measurements in developing a predictive macroscopic model of  sorption behavior
              and fluid-solid partitioning of chromium  and selenium ions; and (4) to study
              the speciation of  chromium and selenium in natural sediments and soils from 
              two field sites.  The proposed research builds on NSF-funded  studies of
              sorption processes of inorganic solutes at  mineral-water interfaces of the
              past six years and is a  natural extension to systems involving redox-sensitive
               inorganic solutes.
