Abstract    :
              9406812  Van Zytveld    Technical abstract:  It is proposed to measure the
              electronic  properties of several strong-scattering liquid systems.  The 
              parameters of emphasis are the electrical resistivity and the  thermoelectric
              power, since these can be compared rather easily  with theoretical
              calculations, and will therefore provide a good  test of theory.  The systems
              under study include the liquid  semimetallic alloys aluminum-calcium and
              aluminum-barium, the pure  liquid metals silicon and germanium, three of the
              liquid heavy  trivalent rare-earth metals, and the unusual "heavy Fermion 
              system", cesium-copper, in liquid form.  These studies will further  the
              understanding of these interesting classes of liquids, and may  also uncover
              materials of interest for thermoelectric power  generation.    Non-technical
              abstract:  It is proposed to measure the electronic  properties of conducting
              liquids:  liquid metals, liquid alloys,  liquid semimetals and liquid
              semiconductors.  In each of the  systems to be studied, the interaction between
              the conducting  electrons and the liquid ions is strong, making these
              properties  more difficult to understand theoretically.  It is anticipated that
               these experimental studies will provide strong tests of the current  theories;
              an evaluation of the properties for possible applications  in thermoelectric
              power generation will also be made.  ***
