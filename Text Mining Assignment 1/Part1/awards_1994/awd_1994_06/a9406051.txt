Abstract    :
              Funds are requested to help support expenses for invited  speakers for the 53rd
              annual symposium of the Society for  Developmental Biology (SDB).  The meeting
              will be of medium  size (300-400 registrants); junior-level attendees will be 
              provided with some financial support.  The meeting will  include a broad range
              of topics; plant, animal and microbial  systems will all be represented in
              sessions organized around  developmental problems and themes rather than
              particular  systems or organisms.  Approximately sixty scientific talks  will
              be presented; there will be a series of six plenary  sessions as well as eight
              minisymposia.  The minisymposia  will be organized and chaired by experts in
              the individual  areas, but most of the talks will be given by junior people.
