Abstract    :
              9406936  Saam     Theoretical research will be done on systems in which the 
              properties of interfaces play a dominant role.  Included are  studies of fluid
              dynamics in restricted geometries, directional  solidification, droplet
              spreading, lubrication, polymer adsorption,  micelle formation and structure,
              wetting phenomena in both mixtures  of helium-three and -four and of hydrogen
              and deuterium, wetting in  metallic films, the properties of helium-three and
              -four mixtures  in aerogel, and the dynamics of prewetting.  Techniques to be 
              employed include Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations of  both
              continuum and lattice models, density-functionals and mean-  field theory.  %%%
               A broad research program using analytical and computational  techniques will
              investigate a variety of physical phenomena in  which the interfaces between
              two different phases play an important  role.  For instance, under what
              conditions does a fluid wet a  surface?  The properties of the interface
              between the solid surface  and the fluid largely determines whether the fluid
              will wet the  surface.  This can have profound fundamental and technological 
              implications.  ***
