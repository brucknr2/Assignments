Abstract    :
              9406941  K.Chen    Partial support will be provided for approximately 12 invited
               speakers to a symposium on innovative techniques recently adopted  in
              multiphase flow and thin film research.  The meeting will have  a total of
              about 50 participants, and will be held on March 26-27,  in Minneapolis (MN). 
              Theoretical approaches, non-intrusive  measuring techniques and parallel
              computing developed in the last  years offer new tools for improved methods of
              investigations, which  would have been not possible only few years ago.  The
              purpose of  this interdisciplinary symposium is to provide a timely forum for 
              presenting the latest developments in multiphase flow and thin film  research,
              to highlight outstanding scientific results, set  directions for future
              research opportunities with the highest  return, and promote interactions among
              researchers in fluid  mechanics, particles technology, heat transfer, applied 
              mathematics, chemical and mechanical engineering.  Senior and young 
              researchers from several countries have been invited to this  symposium.  The
              University of Minnesota offers a stimulating  environment through its research
              groups and well established  laboratories in this field of research.  The
              presentations at the  workshop will be peer reviewed and published in a special
              issue of  the journal on "Theoretical and Computational Fluid Dynamics."  ***
