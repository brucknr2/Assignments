Abstract    :
              9406083  Vernon-Gerstenfeld  This is an award to support a project to address
              the emergence,  current and future role of plastics in environmental
              engineering  practice.  In addition to identifying further research needs, the 
              investigator plans on considering the potential role that a  museum exhibit
              could have in increasing public awareness of the  role played by synthetic
              materials in fabricating water supply,  distribution, storm and sanitary
              drainage components of the urban  infrastructure.  Special emphasis in this
              project is on those  components of the urban infrastructure that impact
              directly on  environmental and public health in contrast those that 
              concentrate on structures such as roads, bridges and buildings.    Results of
              this project are expected to assist in providing a  basis for determination of
              research needs and thus be useful for  program planning purposes.  The
              undergraduate student who will  assist the Principal Investigator on this
              project is Amy L.  Fetzner.  ***
