Abstract    :
                   This project will partially support the research visits of                 
              U.S. scholars in the mathematical sciences to the Institut des                 
               Hautes Etudes Scientifiques (IHES) in Bures-sur-Yvette, France.               
                This international institute is comparable to the Institute for              
                 Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey and, in addition to                 
                  support from the National Science Foundation, is supported in              
                   part by science agencies in a number of other countries.                  
                         Areas of research at the IHES include algebraic geometry,           
                     number theory, combinatorics, group representations, harmonic           
                      analysis, convex sets and analysis, geometry, and topology,            
                       differential geometry, dynamical systems, and ergodic theory.
