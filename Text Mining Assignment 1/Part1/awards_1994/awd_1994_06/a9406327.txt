Abstract    :
              9406327  Hammer       RUTCOR, Rutgers Center for Operations Research at  Rutgers
              University, The State University of New Jersey will  purchase high capacity
              computing equipment which will be  dedicated to the support of research in
              operations research.  The equipment will be used for several research projects,
              in  particular for solving large scale satisfiability problems,  for developing
              efficient algorithms in logic minimization,  for implementing interior point
              algorithms for large scale  linear and nonlinear programming problems, and for
              the  solution of very large scale specially structured linear  programming
              problems.
