Abstract    :
              9406706  Byers  The focus of this research is the development of new 
              carbon-carbon bond forming reactions using free-radicals  generated from
              organoselenides. Due to the specific reactivity  of the phenyl selenide group,
              this methodology will be utilized  to synthesize several important classes of
              organic compounds  such as the amino acids, the butanolides, and the tetronic 
              acids.    With this Renewal RUI award, the Synthetic Organic Program is 
              supporting the research of Dr. Jeffrey H. Byers of the  Department of Chemistry
              of Middlebury College. Professor Byers  will focus his research on development
              of new carbon-carbon  bond forming reactions, one of the most important classes
              of  reactions in organic chemistry, using free-radicals generated  from
              organoselenides.
