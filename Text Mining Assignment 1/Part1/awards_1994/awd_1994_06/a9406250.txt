Abstract    :
              9406250  McMillan   This award provides partial (69%) funding to acquire a light
              detection system and a laser heater for the Raman spectroscopy system in the
              Department of chemistry and Biochemistry at the Arizona State University. The
              institution is committed to providing the remaining funds needed to purchase
              the equipment. The Raman spectroscopy system at Arizona State is used in
              research primarily to characterize chemical bonding and thermodynamic
              properties such as heat capacities and entropies in minerals, liquids and glass
              materials held at high-temperature and high-pressure.   ***
