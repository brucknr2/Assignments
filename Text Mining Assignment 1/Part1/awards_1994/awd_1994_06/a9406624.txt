Abstract    :
              9406624  Carr  Objectives are to complete the geochemical stratigraphy of  DSDP
              495 and to collaborate in the analysis of JOIDES cores  planned for the future
              along the coast of Central America;  to determine the variation with time of
              the elemental fluxes  at the volcanic front; to ascertain in the extent of 
              subduction components in the back arc region; to  characterize the
              pre-metasomatized mantle wedge.  To  accomplish these goals, PIs plan to
              acquire extensive trace  element and isotopic data on sample spanning the last
              2-4 my  in the Moyuta-Tecuamburro segment of Guatemala; to determine  B, Be and
              10Be on lavas in the back arc; and to extend the  regional Pb isotopic study of
              volcanic front and back arc  lavas begun in the previous proposal.
