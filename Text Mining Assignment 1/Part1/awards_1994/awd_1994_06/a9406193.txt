Abstract    :
              9406193  Rocke       The Graduate School of Management at the University of 
              California, Davis will purchase two workstations that will  be dedicated to the
              support of research in the mathematical  sciences.  The equipment will be used
              for several projects,  including in particular:  1.)  Detection of Multivariate
               Outliers;  2.)  Robust Model Selection;  and  3.)  Tabu  Search and Chunking.
