Abstract    :
              This experimental project will examine the validity and feasibility of using
              membrane reactors to isolate intermediate reaction products and reduce the
              formation of byproducts by selectivity enhancement.  The model system to be
              employed is the oxidation of toluene to benzyl alcohol while limiting
              undesirable benzaldehyde.    Membrane reactors offer promise in facilitating
              environmentally benign chemical process conversion.
