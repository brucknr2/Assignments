Abstract    :
              9406922  Javidi  Matched filter functions and optimum processors derived under
              the  spatially overlapping input signal and scene noise assumption may  not
              perform well in the presence of spatially disjoint input signal  and scene
              noise, and could lead to very poor system performance.   The purpose of this
              work is to design new optimum processors for  spatially disjoint signal and
              scene noise.  The principal  investigator will consider a general model of a
              target in non-  overlapping input scene noise where the target may include 
              distortions such as unknown illumination, scale, rotation, etc.   Overlapping
              noise on the target due to detector noise or other  statistical fluctuations
              will be included in this model.  It is  intended to conduct theoretical,
              numerical, and experimental  investigation of the optical pattern recognition
              systems which are  designed in the presence of scene noise that is spatially
              disjoint  with the target.  ***
