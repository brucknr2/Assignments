Abstract    :
              9406047  Brown      The PIs will use high pressure experimental methods and
              instrumentation to measure a full set of elastic constants using impulse
              stimulated scattering, bulk compression, and crystal structure refinement using
              x-ray diffraction methods on the same sample and in the same diamond anvil
              cell.  In this way, it may be possible to obtain an independent check on room
              temperature elastic parameters and to extrapolate results to elevated
              temperatures.  Samples to be measured include natural and synthetic cubic
              garnets of the pyrope-grossular-almandine ternary, olivines and pyroxenes.
