Abstract    :
                9406506      D'Hondt    PI and collaborators will test whether early Paleocene
              last  occurrences of late Cretaceous planktic foraminifera primarily  resulted
              from taxonomic survival or from sedimentary reworking  across the
              Cretaceous-Tertiary (K-T) boundary; principal testing  technique will be
              carbon-isotopic analyses of monospecific samples.    Broader objectives are to
              determine how these last occurrences bear  on gradual or catastrophic
              extinction scenarios, and on exogenous  or endogenous causes of the K-T mass
              extinction.  Study and results  will also bear on a) geographic variation in
              survivorship, b)  relation among survivorship, ecologic strategy, and
              production, and  c) high-resolution biostratigraphy of the K-T boundary.  ***
