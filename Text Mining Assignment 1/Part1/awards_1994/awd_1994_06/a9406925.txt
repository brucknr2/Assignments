Abstract    :
              Project Summary  Tao/ATM-9406925         The objective of this research is to
              develop a fully  nonlinear, nonhydrostatic, compressible high resolution model
              and  to investigate the nonlinear propagation and dissipation of gravity  waves
              in the middle atmosphere.  First studies will be on nonlinear  wave-wave
              interactions in a two dimensional model to understand if  the nonlinearity
              plays any role in the dissipation of gravity  waves.  Then, a three-dimensional
              model will be used to understand  the importance of the nonlinearity and to
              investigate the possible  gravity wave sources in the lower atmosphere.  The
              results from  this research may have important implications on the 
              parameterization of gravity waves in large scale atmospheric  general
              circulation models which are used in studies of climate  changes.
