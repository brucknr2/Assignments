Abstract    :
              Despite their crucial role in reproduction, little is known  about seminal fluid
              molecules that are necessary for the  survival and activation of sperm and for
              the stimulation of  reproductive processes in the mated female.  In Drosophila,
               many of these critical molecules are synthesized by the  male's accessory
              glands.  The PI's laboratory has shown that  accessory gland proteins ("Acps")
              are responsible for short-  term changes in the female's behavior after mating,
              and also  play a role in the storage and utilization of sperm by the  mated
              female.  They  have isolated and characterized 14  Acps.  The PI will continue
              to use a combination of genetic  analyses and determination of the fate of each
              Acp in the  mated female, to define the roles of individual Acps in 
              reproduction.  The PI will then focus on the mode of action  of two Acps.  One
              (Acp26Aa) is believed to act as a hormone  that modifies the mated female's
              physiology and the other  one (Acp36DE) is believed to be necessary for sperm
              storage  and function.  The sequences and modifications of the Acps  that are
              necessary for its localization and function, and  the nature and source of
              other molecules that modify it or  in other ways regulate or affect its
              function will be  determined.  This work addresses important problems in 
              reproduction, fertilization, prohormone action and  reproductive fitness;  it
              also has potential long-term  significance in the area of biological pest
              control.  ***
