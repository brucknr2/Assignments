Abstract    :
              9406959  Ma       The Department of Mathematics at the Southwest Texas  State
              University will purchase a SUN SparcServer 1000 which  will be dedicated to the
              support of research in the  mathematical sciences.  The equipment will be used
              for  several research projects, including in particular:  1.)  Extremal Cayley
              Digraphs on Finite Cyclic Groups, proposed  by  Xingde Jia;  and  2.)  Monomial
              Conjecture - A  Computational Approach, proposed by  Yonghao Ma
