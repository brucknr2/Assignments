Abstract    :
              9406087  Bernstein  The objective of this workshop is to critically evaluate the
               past and present status of geotechnical engineering,  scrutinize the needs of
              the future, and provide directions  to enter the 21st century as a vigorous
              discipline.  In this  context the role of the geomedia vis-a-vis engineering, 
              economic and societal needs will be identified and redefined  if necessary. The
              terminology needed to correctly represent  and communicate the redefined role
              and direction of this  engineering discipline will be developed. And finally, 
              recommendations will be made to inform the public, including  the engineering
              and scientific communities, of the role and  importance of geo- materials and
              systems to the sustained  growth and enhancement of mankind and resources
              available to  support that growth.  ***
