Abstract    :
              9406954  Tewfik    Technical Narrative:    This is a cooperative research
              project between the  University of Minnesota and Bilkent University in Ankara, 
              Turkey.  The investigators are electrical engineers who  propose to address the
              signal processing issues that arise  in the design of an Audio-Visual
              Information Management  System (AVIMS).  Specifically, the project will advance
              the  technology so that users in the United States will have  interactive
              access to the database of the Topkapi Palace  Museum, one of the finest
              archaeological museums in the  world.  The database of this museum contains
              images of  Ottoman calligraphic documents and illuminated manuscripts,  images
              of objects, speech signals, and some video signals.  A major challenge in
              building an AVIMS for such a collection  of data is to provide users with the
              capability of querying  documents based on a keyword, audio or visual feature
              or  subject.  To render the database more accessible to a wider  audience in
              static and mobile settings, the investigators  (Drs. A. Tewfik from the
              University of Minnesota and E.  Cetin from Bilkent University) will provide
              tools to deliver  Ottoman manuscripts in a spoken format.  Ottoman documents 
              will be recorded in spoken form by experts familiar with the  archaic Ottoman
              script.  Users will be provided with the  capability of playing the recorded
              and compressed signals at  various speeds with minimal distortion.  Time-scale 
              modification will also be used to mask most of the random  delays that occur
              during the transmission of audio data over  computer networks.  Project funding
              will enable the two  teams to work together in both Minneapolis and Ankara.
