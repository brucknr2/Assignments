Abstract    :
              Swartz/Cornell University  Project Summary         The Cornell University
              Portable Radar Interferometer (CUPRI)  provides data for studies of ionospheric
              plasma and neutral  turbulence.  CUPRI probes a variety of auroral and
              mid-latitude E-  region phenomena, F-region chemical releases, equatorial
              spread-F,  and the polar mesosphere.  This renewal project will fund the 
              continuing acquisition, analysis and interpretation of CUPRI data.   Both
              undergraduate and graduate students will continue to play a  role in CUPRI
              operations, data analysis, and data interpretation.
