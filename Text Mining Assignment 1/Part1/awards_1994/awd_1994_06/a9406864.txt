Abstract    :
                  9406864  Sinclair  This research is to develop an alternative failure
              criteria to the  standard stress intensity factor.  The new approach relies on
              novel  modeling of the cracks to achieve better estimates of the crack tip 
              stress fields.  The crack is assumed to be an elipse whose root  radius is
              determined from atomic force versus separation laws.  ***
