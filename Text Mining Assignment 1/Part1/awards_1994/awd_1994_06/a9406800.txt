Abstract    :
              9406800  German    Nanoparticles will be mixed with low temperature alloys to
              form a  heated slurry with sufficient fluidity that can be directly molded,  by
              using a net-shape manufacturing process.  A hybrid of  rheocasting and
              injection molding will be applied.  Preliminary  data are necessary to check
              the basic concepts and the approach,  including the proper interfacial
              particle-alloy properties, the  recommended synthesis method for nanoparticles,
              the fluidity and  corresponding thermal characteristics of the composite
              slurry.  The  strength of the resulted composite material should improve it the
               specific powder-alloy interfacial area is larger, and the  dislocation line
              length between phases is smaller.  In the first  set of experiments, nanoscale
              iron precursor materials are low-  cost, commercially available.  If
              successful, the results of the  proposed exploratory research could be
              transferred immediately to  industry.  The approach could offer new
              manufacturing, materials  and design options.    The envisioned process will
              potentially provide new materials with  superstrengths via a low temperature,
              highly automated  manufacturing technology.    ***
