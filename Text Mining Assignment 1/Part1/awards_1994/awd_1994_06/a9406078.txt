Abstract    :
              9406078  Ridgway  PI will investigate the Cantwell Basin strata in Alaska,
              addressing  questions of depositional systems, basin development and 
              paleoclimate.  Strata in the basin may preserve the Cretaceous-  Tertiary
              boundary, as well, offering opportunities to investigate  fossil plant
              community changes at this time in a high-latitude  basin.  Analysis of the
              Cantwell Basin will be a key step in  developing a regionally integrated data
              base for strike-slip basins  along the Denali fault system.
