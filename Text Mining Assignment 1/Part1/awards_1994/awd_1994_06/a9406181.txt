Abstract    :
              9406181  Banerjee      The PI will organize and run a topical workshop on
              "Remagnetization and Environmental Rock Magnetism: Clues to Records of Past
              Geodynamics and Global Change" for a group of about 50 participants, including
              approximately 16 graduate students and postdocs.  The workshop will feature a
              number of invited speakers and will address questions of how magnetic
              signatures can provide information on past climate change.  ****
