                   ABSTRACT      The research deals with the development of a hybrid rotor
              for continuous field-flow fractionation (FFF).  By combining conventional
              sedimentation with FFF in a two-dimensional system, a rotor whose selectivity
              is proportional to the square of the centrifugal field can be designed in
              principle.  However, problems with flow instability have hindered the rotor
              development.  The primary objective of the research is to establish whether the
              rotor can be operated without centrifugal instability.  Linear stability theory
              will be used to determine the conditions for the onset of instability in terms
              of appropriate experimental parameters.  If successful, large scale
              fractionation of submicron particles to high purity will become practical using
              FFF.  This would then have a strong impact on separations technology for
              submicron particles, especially for bioprocessing applications.
