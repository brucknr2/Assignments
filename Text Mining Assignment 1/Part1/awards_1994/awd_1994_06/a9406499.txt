Abstract    :
              9406499  Rhodes       This award provides 59 % of the funding necessary to 
              acquire a new x-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer that  will be installed and
              operated in the x-ray analytical  facility in the Department of Geology and
              Geography at the  University of Massachusetts. The University is committed to 
              providing the remaining 41% of the cost of acquiring this  instrument system.  
                  The new XRF spectrometer will be used to obtain  multielement quantitative
              chemical composition of geological  samples, covering both major and trace
              elements. The  University of Massachusetts x-ray analytical facility  provides 
              analyses for research and teaching projects in the  geosciences and serves the
              needs of regional, national, and  international research groups, as well as
              those of the  Principal Investigator and University of Massachusetts 
              colleagues.  ***
