Abstract    :
              9406826  Barker    This proposal for connection of Hiwassee College, Tennessee 
              Wesleyan College, Sweetwater High School, Vonore High School,  Tellico Plains
              High School, Madisonville High School, and the  Monroe County Vocational School
              to NSFNET through SURAnet.  SURAnet  is the midlevel network located in the
              southern United States.   These connections will provide operations management
              and  information services and it will give the colleges and high schools  a 56
              thousand bits per second connection to the NSFNET, a high  speed (1.5 - 45
              million bits per second) National Backbone network.    The benefits of the
              NSFNET connection include e-mail between local  and remote researchers and
              educators, file transfer capability and  the ability to use remote computer
              resources.  Also the colleges  and high schools will have the ability to
              investigate innovation in  educational resources and incorporate them into
              their curricula.
