Abstract    :
              9406058  Peterman    Madonna College requests support from NSF for a connection
              of its  campus network to Michnet and NSFNET.  Michnet is the midlevel  network
              located in the state of Michigan that will provide  operations and network
              information services.  It will give Madonna  College a 56 thousand bits per
              second connection to the NSFNET, a  high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per
              second) National Backbone  network.    The College needs greater functionality
              and network speed to be  able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make
              file transfers  along with being able to implement a more reliable mail system.
                Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.  This is  also a
              unique opportunity for the school to explore innovative  educational resources.
