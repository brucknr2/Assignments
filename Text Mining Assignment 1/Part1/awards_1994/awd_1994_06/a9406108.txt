Abstract    :
              9406108  Bowring  PIs and collaborators will develop new biostratigraphic and 
              geochronologic bases for correlation of the Lower-Middle Cambrian  of Avalon
              and Morocco.  Detailed work on the small shelly fossils  of the Avalon
              sequence, combined with high-precision geochronology,  will provide a
              significantly refined time scale for this important  time in evolution of life
              on Earth.  Study of Moroccan sequence  will permit correlation, and allow
              extension of the study in the  time scale.  Work will also contribute to
              understanding the  tectonic history of these Cambrian platforms.
