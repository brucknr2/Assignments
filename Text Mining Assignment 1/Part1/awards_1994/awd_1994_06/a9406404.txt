Abstract    :
              9406404  McClelland       Northern and central Alaska consist primarily of large
              blocks  of continental crust that are locally overlain by oceanic crustal 
              fragments.  Gross similarities between them has led to speculation   that they
              are all fragments of North America's continental margin,  however data to
              support or refute this hypothesis is particularly  sparse int he Ruby terrane
              of central Alaska.  This project will  provide the necessary thermal and
              structural history of this area  in order to reconstruct the subduction and
              exhumation events so  that a firm comparisons to other continental blocks can
              be made.   Results should lead to a rubust model of the Mesozoic 
              paleogeography of the northern Cordillera and answer the question  of what the
              relative significance of strike-slip, thrust and  extensional tectonics were in
              the history of the Ruby terrane, and  how it arrival at its current oblique
              angle to the regional trends  in the northern Cordillera.
