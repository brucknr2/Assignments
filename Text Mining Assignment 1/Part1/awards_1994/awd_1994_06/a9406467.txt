Abstract    :
                   This award will support four postdoctoral visitors per year at the Courant
              Institute of  Mathematical Sciences (CIMS), New York University.  The purpose
              of the CIMS Visitors  Program is to expose new Ph.D.s to problems of applied
              interest from a wide variety of                fields (fluid flow, statistical
              mechanics, biology, etc.) and to the mathematical tools (partial  differential
              equations, small and large-scale computation, etc.) appropriate to their
              solution.  This   marriage of pure and applied mathematics was pioneered at
              CIMS under the direction of  Richard Courant.  The open character of the
              Institute encourages contact between visitors,  faculty and students,
              participation in a wide variety of seminars and advanced courses of 
              instruction in both pure and applied mathematics, and collaborative work
              crossing the  conventional lines of specialization.
