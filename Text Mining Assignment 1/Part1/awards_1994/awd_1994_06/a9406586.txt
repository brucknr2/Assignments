Abstract    :
              9406586  Prave       Building on a pilot project, PI and co-workers, including
              Paul  Hoffman and members of the Namibian Geological Survey, will examine  key
              strata from the late Proterozoic, a critical time in Earth and  life history. 
              Study will include sequence stratigraphy, structural  geology, U-Pb
              geochronology, chemostratigraphy, and regional  tectonics.  Team will
              critically evaluate, chronometrically  calibrate, and selectively refine the
              timing of Neoproterozoic  isotopic excursions and glaciations, as well as the
              timing and  kinematics of continental breakup and assembly of southern 
              Gondwanaland.
