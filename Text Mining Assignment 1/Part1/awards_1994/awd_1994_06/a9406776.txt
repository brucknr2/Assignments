Abstract    :
              9406776  Shonkwiler       The Principal Investigators of the School of 
              Mathematics of the Georgia Institute of Technology will  purchase a Silicon
              Graphics Challenge L parallel computer  associated hardware and software.      
              This equipment will be dedicated to support the  mathematical research of the
              individual of the group some of  whom need the computational power to make
              their computations  feasible and some of whom are doing research in parallel 
              processing.  The equipment will allow the PI's and their  graduate students to
              carry out several research projects,  including in particular:  1.)  Global
              Dynamics of Ordinary  Differential Equations;  2.)  Global Dynamics from Time 
              Series Data;  3.)  Proof of the Four Color Theorem and its Generalization 
              Known as Grotzsch  Conjecture;  4.)  Numerical Methods for Hyperbolic Systems; 
              and  5.)  Random Restarts in Global Optimization.       All of the projects
              above have a strong computational  component and aim at developing reliable and
              rigorously  algorithms.
