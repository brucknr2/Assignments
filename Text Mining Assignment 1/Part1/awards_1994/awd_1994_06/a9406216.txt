Abstract    :
              9406216  Thomas       Thrust belts worldwide are characterized by large-scale
              bends  in trace: salients and recesses.  As thrust belts advance they load  the
              craton edge, producing foreland basins.  Most previous studies  of foreland
              basin formation use either salients or straight  portions in order to avoid
              three-dimensional complexities in thrust  direction.  This study will take
              advantage of a large subsurface  data base to model the development of a recess
              (the Black Warrior  foreland basin) in which convergence of thrusting from
              different  directions has resulted in a complex pattern of structural 
              interference, diverse progradation of sediment wedges and numerous 
              along-strike changes in thrusting, lading and subsidence.  Results  should help
              understand these more complex interactions, which will  be of use in
              understanding foreland basins elsewhere.
