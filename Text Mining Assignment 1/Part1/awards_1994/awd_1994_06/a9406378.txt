Abstract    :
              9406378  Meyer                            This research is to analyze a unique
              30-Gbyte, 70-site seismic  data set as a result of 1991 and 1992 deployments,
              supported  elsewhere, of portable digital-recording three-component long- and 
              short-period seismographs in coherent arrays in central Russia.   These arrays
              covered representative parts of the Siberian craton,  the Baikal uplift, the
              Baikal Rift, and the mountains and steppes  south of the lake extending into
              Mongolia.  This will be a  coordinated joint analysis between the Institute of
              the Earth's  Crust, Irkutsk, and the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 
              Questions  to be answered are is the Baikal Rift today a passive or an active 
              tectonic feature, and perhaps, what was it at its inception?  The  results will
              be compared with other Cenozoic seismically-active  rifts, for example Kenya
              and Rio Grande, being studied today, using  the same tools and methods.  This
              research is a component of the  National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
