Abstract    :
              9406205  Daines      The PI will investigate melt distribution and migration in 
              partially molten anorthosites using synthetic anorthosites in which  a glass
              phase with a composition approximating either a parental  magma or a late-stage
              differentiated melt has been added.   Characterization will use optical,
              scanning and transmission  electron microscopy.  The data obtained from these
              experiments are  critical for evaluating the efficacy of dynamic models
              proposed to  account for the formation of anorthosites and will provide insight
               into cumulate maturation and magma chamber processes.  ****
