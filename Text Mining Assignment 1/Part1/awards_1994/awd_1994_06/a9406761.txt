Abstract    :
              9406761  Beckage    This is a request for funds to sponsor a symposium entitled,
               "Parasitic Effects on Host Hormones and Behavior" at the  January 1995 meeting
              of the American Society of Zoologists.  A panel of 19 speakers have confirmed
              their willingness to  participate in the symposium.  The topic is timely and is
              of  broad interest to a diverse groups of scientists; it will  likely attract a
              wide range of researchers and students in  endocrinology, behavior, immunology,
              and evolutionary  biology.  Presentations on invertebrates and vertebrates 
              will be interspersed, to attract a wide audience and  emphasize comparison
              among diverse taxa.  The speakers  include several individuals of junior rank
              as well as  several internationally recognized senior scientists.  ***
