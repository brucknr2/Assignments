Abstract    :
              9406289  Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute  Georges Belfort    ABSTRACT    A
              foremost aim of this research will be the development of a simple, inexpensive
              and generic approach to immobilize affinity, reactive, or catalytic groups to
              synthetic membranes.  In this case, the work will involve construction and
              expression in E. coli of a gene for unique fusion proteins consisting of a
              cellulose binding domain region and a catalytic antibody-biosynthetic enzyme
              portion (CBDE2-43C9).  The cellulose binding domain permits attachment to
              cellulosic membranes while the affinity or catalytic group tailors the membrane
              reactor for specific applications.    Membrane reactors are attractive because
              they can allow continuous operation, enhance mass transfer, and facilitate
              product isolation.  These factors help to make processing more economical in
              the chemical and biotechnology industries.
