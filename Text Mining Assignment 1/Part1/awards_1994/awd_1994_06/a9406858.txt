Abstract    :
              9406858  ARROYO    This three-year plan of postdoctoral study will allow Dr.
              Arroyo  the opportunity to obtain training in archaeometric research 
              techniques in the archaeometry laboratory at the Missouri  University Research
              Reactor (MURR).  The techniques learned at  MURR will be applied to data that
              will be recovered on a regional  survey on the Pacific coast of Guatemala.  The
              research will  integrate different lines of technical investigations previously
               done as well as information from the field survey and  excavations.  Research
              areas will include the origins of the  early formative pottery assemblage,
              dating of the early formative  assemblage, middle formative occupation, and
              cultural evolution  of the region.    One of the research focusses of
              archaeometry is the development  of ceramic production and exchange.  An
              important contribution of  the field is the establishment of linkages between
              the physical  properties of objects and human behavior.  Variation in the 
              physical states of artifacts may be evaluated to understand  prehispanic
              cultural evolution.
