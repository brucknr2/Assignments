Abstract    :
              9406770  Jones       The Department of Mathematics at the University of 
              California at Berkeley will purchase four SUN Microsystems  Sparcstation 10
              model 40 and one file server with eight  gigabytes of storage space that will
              be dedicated to the  support of research in the mathematical sciences.  The 
              equipment will be used for the three research projects  detailed below: 1.) 
              Numerical modeling of solidification  processes;  2.)  Computer assisted
              computations in  Noncommutative Geometry;  and  3.)  DNA unlinking simulation 
              and Statistical Mechanical models.
