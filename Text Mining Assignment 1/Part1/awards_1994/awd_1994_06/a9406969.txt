Abstract    :
              9406969  Amero    The project is directed towards understanding the mechanism of
              action of a unique transcription factor, PEP, isolated from Drosophila.  The
              protein is associated with RNA in the nucleus and therefore termed an hnRNP,
              heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein.  Biochemical characterization of the
              protein suggests that it may play a role in activating transcription while
              associated with RNA.  This is a very unusual function for an hnRNP and will be
              investigated more thoroughly.  Genetic studies and in vivo analysis of  PEP
              function are difficult in Drosophila.  The award will be used to identify and
              characterize a comparable gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  A colleague, Dr.
              Johns Lopes, has agreed to assist the PI in learning the appropriate yeast
              manipulations.  %%%  The project deals with a very unusual protein isolated
              from fruit flies.  The protein is found tightly bound to RNA but seems to also
              affect the expression of information from DNA.  The preliminary
              characterization of the protein has been carried as far as is reasonably
              possible using the insect system.  To more completely understand the mechanism
              of action of the protein, the yeast homologue will be characterized and the
              corresponding gene cloned and mutated.  Studies of mutant forms of the protein
              will greatly facilitate the identification of protein affects gene expression
              in living cells.  ***
