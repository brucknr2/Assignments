Abstract    :
              9406617  HARTIGAN         The Department of Statistics at Yale University will 
              purchase a SPARCstation 10 (Model 512MP) server, two X-terminals  a laser
              printer and peripherals.  This equipment will be  dedicated to supporting
              research in the mathematical sciences,  including (i) neural network
              computations; (ii) probabilistic  models for constructing and evaluating
              classifications, and the  role of classification in data collection and
              justification of  probability distributions; (iii) exact finite sample
              confidence  bands for nonparametric functionals; (iv) symbolic computation to 
              guide asymptotic theory; (v) information in semiparametric  mixtures and
              hierarchical mixture models.
