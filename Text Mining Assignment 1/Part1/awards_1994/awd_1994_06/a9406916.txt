Abstract    :
              9406916  Watson  This project involves research related to deep crustal and 
              upper mantle chemical processes, focusing on but not limited  to diffusion. 
              Five key sub themes of the research are:  (1)  connectivity of fluids and melts
              in the lower crust and  upper mantle, (2) diffusion in magmas, with specific
              focus  on sulfur, (3) lattice diffusion in minerals, using  Rutherford
              Backscattering Spectroscopy (RBS) as a tool for  depth-profiling very short,
              laboratory induced diffusion  gradients, (4) permeability of the partially
              molten mantle,  using a technique in which molten Na-carbonate is  substituted
              for basaltic melt, and (5) chemical transport by  slab-derived fluids in
              subduction zones, focused on  development of techniques for controlled
              devolatization,  release, and capture of aqueous fluids from hydrous mafic 
              assemblages.
