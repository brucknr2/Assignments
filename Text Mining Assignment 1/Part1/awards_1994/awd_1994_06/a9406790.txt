Abstract    :
              9406790  Manghnani      The PIs will perform an experimental investigation of
              the elastic  and anelastic properties of molten and partially molten Fe-Ni-S
              and  Fe-Ni-Si alloys that are relevant to the Earth's outer core.  From  the
              values of VP and QP in these systems, bulk modulus and  viscosity will be
              calculated.  The results should provide useful  criteria with which to
              interpret existing data on shocked melts of  pure Fe and Fe alloys, as well as
              seismological data on the outer  core.  ****
