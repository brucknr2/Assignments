Abstract    :
              9406663  Chassignet    Data suggest that large number of vortices are present in
              the ocean  at any time and modern eddy-resolving general circulation models 
              generate vortices which are potentially od dynamically  significance.  This
              project is to conduct theoretical and numerical  studies of oceanic rings and
              vortices.  In particular, to study the  interaction of vortices and external
              influences as topography and  shear.  Particular attention will be given to
              stability of  convective rings.  The results of the research will be used to
              the  interpretation of data and models, and will be very useful for the 
              construction of future models and the planning of field work.
