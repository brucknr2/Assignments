Abstract    :
              9406370  Zindler       This award provides one-half the funding required for 
              the acquisition of a high-abundance-sensitivity,  multicollector, thermal
              ionization mass spectrometer that  will be installed and operated in the
              National High Magnetic  Field Laboratory at Florida State University. The
              Florida  State University is committed to providing the remaining  funds
              necessary for the acquisition. The equipment will be  used primarily for
              research in geosciences dealing with the  geochemistry of the Earth's mantle
              and crust.  ***
