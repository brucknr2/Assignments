Abstract    :
              9406652  Coe       Papua New Guinea is one of the few places where an arc- 
              continent collision is actively producing a mountain belt, and as  such serves
              as a type area for present day continental accretion.   However, several
              competing models of the neotectonics of the region  points out the need for
              more robust data.   Paleomagnetism offers  such a tool, that in conjunction
              with basic geologic information,  can demonstrate the amount, rate and scale of
              rotations of blocks  during deformation.  This work will take advantage of the
              young  sediments and the on-going deformation to define block size and to 
              demonstrate whether or not sequential rotations of blocks occurs as  each
              arrives and collides.  Results will help understand behavior  and also will be
              invaluable in parallel studies of the Finisterre  range and studies of the rate
              and morphology of sea level terrace  uplift along the Papua New Guinea coast.
