Abstract    :
              9406106  Cameron       This award provides 75 % of the funding necessary to 
              modernize a used electron microprobe recently acquired by  the Earth Sciences
              Department at the University of  California in Santa Cruz. The institution is
              committed to  providing the remaining 25 % funding required.       The upgrade
              to the electron microprobe instrument will  include PC-based automation of
              x-ray spectrometers and  sample stage control as well as improvements to the
              energy  dispersive x-ray analysis system, image analysis system, and 
              back-scattered electron detector and imaging system. The  improved microprobe
              system will provide accurate micro-  analysis capabilities, with
              micrometer-scale spatial  resolution, for a number of earth science researchers
              at UC-  Santa Cruz.  ***
