Abstract    :
              9406574  ZELDITCH   This award will support the travel, lodging expenses and
              registration costs for speakers in a symposium entitled "Historical patterns of
              developmental integration" which will be presented at the meetings of the
              American Society of Zoologists (ASZ) in January 1995.  Patterns in the
              embryology or development of organisms can reveal information important to
              understanding the relationships among members of groups of organisms.  The
              speakers, who include several leaders in this field, will address important
              questions about the independence vs integration or interdependence of
              developmental data (from molecular to morphological) and how to incorporate
              such data in phylogenetic analyses or the study of relationships among species.
               Proceedings of the symposium will be published so that this information is
              disseminated to a wider audience that just those individuals able to attend and
              hear the presentations.  %%%   The talks given at this meeting will address
              means of incorporating embryological or developmental information into analysis
              of the relationships among living things.  Sometimes, developmental information
              can shed important new light on relationships.  The best and most complete
              knowledge of the relationships among members of different groups of living
              things is very important for predicting things about the biology of related
              species, including the possible occurrence or production or useful natural
              products such new drugs to combat human or animal diseases.  ***
