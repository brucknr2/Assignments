Abstract    :
              9406332  Boyajian       PI will use a quantitative method to assess the
              completeness  of stratigraphic ranges of fossil families over the Phanerozoic, 
              using J. Sepkoski's database of over 34,000 genera and 4,000  families.  By
              this method PI can evaluate what periods of geologic  time have been
              effectively sampled by paleontologists and what  periods of time need more
              sampling, and can quantitatively assess  how much the record might improve by
              collecting more data.
