Abstract    :
              9406325  Nesbitt       The proposed project is a study to revise and refine the 
              chronostratigraphic correlation of marine Paleocene rocks of  western Oregon. 
              Washington, British Columbia and the Alaskan  Peninsula.  The currently defined
              biostratigraphic scheme for these  rocks has numerous sources of error.  These
              have been perpetuated  because of the lack of recognition of facies controls,
              time-  transgressive nature of the faunas, and biogeographical  provincialism. 
              This study will evaluate the existing molluscan  biozones and define new
              biozones where needed.  The molluscan zonal  scheme will be correlated with
              foraminiferal and calcareous  nannoplankton data supplied by collaborating
              micropaleontologists  who are currently working in this area.  Radiometric
              dates will be  obtained from tuffs and other volcanic rocks interbedded within
              the  appropriate sedimentary units.  The zonal scheme for the Pacific 
              Northwest will be correlated with worldwide time scales.  This  refined,
              reliable and globally relevant chronstratigraphy will be  the foundation for
              future research projects on invertebrate and  vertebrate phylogenies, faunal
              response to global climate changes,  and boundary extinctions.
