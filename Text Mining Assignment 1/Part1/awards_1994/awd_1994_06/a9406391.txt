Abstract    :
              9406391  Liff  The three-dimensional structure of the cross-linked high-sulphur 
              protein matrix of wool fibers is still largely unknown.  This  project will
              investigate (1) the conformational preferences of  the chains of the matrix and
              the conformational implications of  the characteristic pentapeptide repeat and
              (2) the degree and the  homogeneity of the crosslinking in the matrix network
              formed by  disulfide bonding.  These parameters constitute essentially full 
              characterization of a cross-linked polypeptide system.  To study  these issues
              liquid state High Resolution 2D NMR, as well as  solid state NMR, which
              involves the analysis of chemical shift  anisotropy and quadropolar
              interactions, will be applied to model  polypeptide systems.  An understanding
              of the structure of the  interfilament matrix is one of the most important
              problems in the  biophysical chemistry of natural fibers and it is of special 
              interest to materials science, where natural materials are  studied to foster
              new ideas for designing novel man-made  materials.  %%%  The purpose of this
              research is to elucidate the structure of the  biopolymeric networks formed by
              cross-linked high-sulphur  proteins of wool fibers.  An understanding of their
              structure is  one of the most important problems in biophysical chemistry of 
              natural fibers and is of special interest to materials science  where natural
              materials are studied to foster new ideas for  designing novel man-made
              materials.  A variety of Nuclear  Magnetic Resonance techniques will be used as
              they are the most  appropriate and the most powerful tools for this
              investigation.  ***
