Abstract    :
              9406912  Rigby  The focus of this research is the development of strategies for 
              alkaloid synthesis that involve the use of vinyl isocyanates as  the 4-pi
              partners in cyclocondensation reactions. The work will  extend this reaction
              profile by including partners such as  isocyanides and triene-metal complexes. 
              The unique  characteristics of vinyl isocyanides will be examined to obtain  an
              "umpoled" version of the vinyl isocyanate series.  The  methodology will be
              showcased on a series of alkaloids  including pancratistatin.  %%%  With this
              renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is  supporting the research of Dr.
              James H. Rigby of the Department  of Chemistry at Wayne State University. 
              Professor Rigby will  focus his work on developing methods for the synthesis of
               nitrogen containing organic compounds by the use of vinyl  isocyanates.  A key
              target for synthesis will be  pancratistatin, a molecule with interesting
              biological  properties.
