Abstract    :
                  9406621    Christopher Ruff/ Catherine Rafferty    This dissertation project
              is an innovative application of  imaging techniques from radiographs to the
              dynamics and  comparisons of joint mechanics of different living and  fossil
              primates.  There is substantial evidence that  trabecular bone in the
              subarticular regions of joints  respond to alterations in the mechanical
              environment.  By  becoming oriented in the direction of the major stresses 
              existing, the boney struts and plates will act to minimize  the bending
              stresses, as one example.    This project will examine external and
              subarticular joint  structure in relation to body size and locomotion in a 
              number of primate and other mammalian species, and the  results will be applied
              to the study of osteological  specimens of subfossil lemurs in museum
              collections.  Joint  surface area and volume will be estimated from external 
              measurements, and the mass, density and distribution of  subarticular
              trabecular bone will be derived using image  analysis of the radiographs.   
              The project will also result in the expert and specialized  training of a new
              professional.    ***
