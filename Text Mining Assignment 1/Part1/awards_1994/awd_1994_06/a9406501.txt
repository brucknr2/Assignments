Abstract    :
              9406501  Carr    Dr. Carr will continue his investigations of the low frequency
              magnetospheric  radio emissions from Jupiter.  Included in the program are: a)
              the continued  operation and upgrading of the University of Florida Radio
              Observatory for  the monitoring of Jupiter's decametric emissions between 15
              and 32 MHz;  b) the analysis of Jovian decametric data from this and other
              observatories  and the development of models to account for the characteristics
              of the  emissions; and c) the continuation of the analysis of the Voyager
              spacecraft  decametric, hectometric, and kilometric data from Jupiter and its
              use in  emission source and beam modeling.  These studies are intended to
              enhance  our understanding of the sources of Jovian low frequency radio
              emission and  their relationships to the magnetospheric environment.
