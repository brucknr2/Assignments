Abstract    :
              9406211  Shock       This award provides one-half the funding required for  the
              acquisition of an inductively-coupled plasma mass  spectrometer system to be
              installed and operated in the  Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at
              the Washington  University in St. Louis. The University is committed to 
              providing the remaining funds necessary to acquire the  equipment. The
              analytical capabilities of the instrument are  needed in research and graduate
              teaching within the  University's new program of Environmental Geochemistry and
               Dynamics, as well as in a wide range of research projects in  environmental
              geochemistry, cosmochemistry, fluid/rock  interactions, analysis of sediment
              deposits by the Missouri  and Mississippi floods of 1993, and migration of
              trace  metals from sites of oil field brine contamination.  ***
