Abstract    :
              9406056  Bebout       This action provides partial funding in support of a 
              conference entitled "SUBCON, subduction from Top to Bottom" to be  held June
              13-17, 1994 in Avalon, California.  The goal of the  conference is to review
              and summarize the lost decade of work on  subduction zone dynamics, and to
              outline promising new areas of  research.  A further goal is to increase
              awareness of the hazards  associated with subduction zone evolution.
