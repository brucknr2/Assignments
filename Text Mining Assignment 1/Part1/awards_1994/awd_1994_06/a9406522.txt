              Chlamtac, Imrich  NCR-9406522  University of Massachusetts  A Generalized
              Approach to WDM Optical Packet Switched Networks      Third generation
              "all-optical" networks are advocated to yield a nearly  four orders of
              magnitude capacity increase by circumventing the speed  limitations of
              electronics. In an optical packet switched network it is  necessary to have a
              methodology to deal optically with the fundamental  resource contentions
              problem occurring when multiple packets are  concurrently vying for key optical
              network resources. These can be  transmitters, receivers, switches, and
              channels. To realize the optical  capacity of the fiber, i.e., eliminate the
              electronic bottleneck, resource  contention must be resolved in a way which
              maintains packets flowing  through the network in the optical domain.    One
              possible solution is based on the use of optical switches and fiber  delay
              lines to realize an all-optical switch termed Switched Delay Lines  (SDL). 
              Among the advantages demonstrated for this approach are its  relative
              simplicity, implementation potential and excellent performance.  The goal of
              this research is the extension of the above solution to the  case of wavelength
              sensitive switches, targeted towards the emerging WDM  based communications
              environment.    Preliminary results show that an SDL WDM solution can offer: 1)
              an optical  WDM packet switching transmission; 2) use of attractive hardware
              design  based on small number of delay lines, minimal functionality switches,  
              replacement of fast tunability by WDM filtering; 3) fault tolerance; and  4)
              feasible electronic control.    The research results of this study can be
              expected to lay a basis for the  next generation optical packet switched
              LAN/MAN WDM networks. It will thus  enable the use of WDM in LAN and MAN
              communication systems for multiplexing  several high speed data streams onto
              the optical fiber, without requiring  unrealistic parallel electronic
              processing.  As a result, the throughput  potential of optical networks may be
              increased by orders of magnitude  paving the way for future applications.
