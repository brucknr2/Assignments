Abstract    :
              94066183  Edwards       This award provides partial funding for  two technical 
              support positions in the Department of Geology & Geophysics  Minnesota Isotope
              Laboratory at the University of Minnesota.  The technical work in the isotope
              laboratory is labor-  intensive, involves maintenance of sophisticated 
              instrumentation, requires extensive training of  senior and  student
              researchers, both on- and off-campus, and needs the  full-time attention of 
              dedicated technicians. The Minnesota  Isotope Laboratory is involved in
              fundamental research to  establish high-resolution global climate (glacial-to- 
              interglacial time scales) and regional climate (century to  decadal time
              scales) chronologies.  ***
