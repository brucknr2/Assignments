Abstract    :
              9406002  Roberts      The PI and post-doc will perform numerical simulations of
              core  turbulence and extract from them information on the turbulent  diffusion
              coefficients required to make the macroscale (dynamo)  equations definite.  In
              parallel they will explore how different  parameterizations affect the
              solutions of the dynamo equations.   Success in these activities will provide a
              significant step towards  the ultimate goal of developing a realistic model of
              the geodynamo.  ****
