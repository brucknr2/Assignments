Abstract    :
              9406269  Pullin    This Americas Program award will support a collaborative
              research  between Dr. Jorge Pullin, The Pennsylvania State University and 
              Professor Rodolfo Gambini, Universidad de la Republica,  Montevideo, Uruguay,
              on the application of loop techniques to the  quantization of general
              relativity.  The objective is to study  the extended loop representation of
              quantum gravity in which  loops are replaced by extended objects which help
              deal with  regularization issues, and, to analyze the equivalence between  the
              connection and group representations.  They also propose to  study the
              underlying classical canonical theory, which has  potential to become a useful
              reformulation of classical general  relativity.      The concept of reconciling
              general relativity and quantum  mechanics is one of the most intractable of
              modern theoretical  physics.  The need for a quantum theory of gravity is
              clear, both  on theoretical grounds and for practical purposes, but, so far, 
              all straightforward attempts to quantize general relativity have  failed.  This
              proposal will focus on a new approach to this  problem, derived from the recent
              discovery of new loop variables  and the reformulation of general relativity as
              a theory of  connections.  This is an important research that will benefit 
              greatly from the complementary expertise of the researchers, and  that is
              likely to have a substantial impact on progress in  quantum gravity.    ***
