Abstract    :
              9406763  BICKERTON                                ABSTRACT    The project seeks
              to determine the distribution and nature of  contact languages (in particular
              Hawaiian) within Hawaii and the  distribution of Hawaiian as a contact language
              throughout the  Pacific basin. The Hawaiian and Pacific Special Collections of 
              Hamilton Library in the University of Hawaii contain a vast  collection of
              materials, both published and unpublished,  including microfilmed copies of
              most of the many journals and  newspapers, also in several languages, published
              in Hawaii since  the mid-nineteenth century: this unrivalled database has been 
              barely touched by researchers. The project will search and (where  necessary)
              translate these materials with the goal of compiling  an annotated bibliography
              of all references to language contact  in this literature and all citations of
              utterances used in  contact situations. The citations will be analyzed
              linguistically  to determine to what extent modes of communication represent 
              unstable jargon(s) and whether any could be described as stable  pidgins.
              Materials so far sampled indicate that a radical version  of the role of
              Hawaiian (and perhaps other indigenous contact  languages) in language contact
              will result from this research,  challenging received opinion which gives
              English the major role  in Hawaii contacts and an almost exclusive role in
              Pacific  contacts.  Valuable light will also be cast on the nature of the 
              input that gave rise to Hawaiian Creole English.
