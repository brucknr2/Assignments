Abstract    :
                9406938  Das    Description:  This project supports  participation by U.S.
              physicists in an  international workshop on the physics at the  Planck scale,
              to be held in Puri, India, in  December, 1994.  The Indian organizer is 
              Professor J. Maharana of the Institute of  Physics, Bhubaneswar 751 005, India.
               The  workshop is designed to bring together most of  the active physicists of
              India working in the  area, along with some of the most eminent  physicists of
              the world, to discuss some of the  most fundamental problems of physics.  the 
              Topics will be: physics of black holes and  their evaporations, evolution of
              the Universe  at very early epochs, the problem of the  cosmological constant,
              as well as the question  of unification of fundamental forces of Nature.   
              Scope:  The scientific field of the proposed  workshop is one in which the
              Indian scientific  community has made noticeable contributions.   There is a
              real potential that some of the  Indian participants in the workshop will 
              contribute to the body of knowledge available  in the field.  This area of
              theoretical physics  has been popular with scientists from less  industrialized
              countries where modern  experimental physics facilities are not readily 
              available.  The workshop will provide for  exchanges of information and
              stimulate joint  research and collaboration in this relatively  low-cost
              research.  ***
