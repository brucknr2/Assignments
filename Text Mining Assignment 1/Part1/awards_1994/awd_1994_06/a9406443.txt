Abstract    :
              9406443  Williams       The tectonics of the early earth is controversial and 
              difficult to study.  The snowbird tectonic zone is a long boundary  between
              northern Saskatchewan tectonic provinces, that has recently  been tecontized in
              the mid-Archean (3.2 Ga). These rocks contain  unusually well perceived high
              pressure minerals and fabrics  presumably due to Archean collisions.  This
              project will study  three distinct terranes within the Snowbird zone to unravel
              how  each formed and how they came to be joined by Archean tectonic 
              displacement.  Results have considerable significance to the early  development
              of cratons, especially deep crustal processes.
