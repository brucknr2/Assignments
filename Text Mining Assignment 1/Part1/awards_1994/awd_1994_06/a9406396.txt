Abstract    :
              9406396  Johnsson       Understanding of complex organic/inorganic interactions
              in  forested ecosystems requires an interdisciplinary approach wherein  field
              observations from carefully selected study areas are combined  with macroscopic
              thermodynamic and kinetic investigations and with  surface-sensitive
              technologies (e.g., atomic force microscopy, AFM;  scanning tunneling
              microscopy, STM; X-ray photoelectron  spectroscopy, XPS) that are capable of
              probing the unique  structure, composition, and reactivity of the mineral/water
               interface.  This Research Planning Grant proposal outlines two  studies
              wherein an interdisciplinary approach is taken to  understanding the effects of
              organic acids on chemical weathering  and trace-metal mobilization in acidic,
              organic-rich soils and  streams.  These studies include (1) the effects of
              simple (oxalate)  and complex (humic and fulvic) organic acids on hematite 
              dissolution in mixed-ligand systems, and (2) the effects of organic  acids on
              AL-hydroxide secondary phase formation during the  dissolution of
              phyllosilicates (muscovite and kaolinite).  Both of  these studies involve
              integration of geochemical experimentation  from the atomic- to the water shed
              scale.  Results of these  preliminary studies will be used as background for
              submission of a  large-scale NSF grant, in 1994-95. In addition, establishment
              of a  new field study area, design and construction of a flow-trough  reaction
              vessel attachment to a computerized potentiostat, and  development of expertise
              in the use of 14C- labelled organic acids  in competitive sorption experiments
              will lay the groundwork for  additional research efforts involving a wide range
              of  organic/inorganic interactions.
