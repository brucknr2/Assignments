Abstract    :
              9406318  Hill       The objectives of this research are 1) the development of 
              better and more efficient computational methods in atomic and  molecular
              physics and 2) highly accurate calculations on small  atomic systems which can
              be compared to experiment.  Convergence  rates are studied and errors in
              variational calculations  carefully estimated.  Specific problems include the
              construction  of He wavefunctions incorporating all known singularities, 
              estimates of non-linear parameters in various basis set expansion  techniques,
              studies of the Dirac equation and Bethe logarithm  computations.  ***
