Abstract    :
              9406295  Slemrod       This proposal outlines proposed research in three areas:
              (i)  kinetic modeling of gases exhibiting change of phase and  metastable
              states, (ii) resolution of Riemann problems of  hyperbolic systems of
              conservation laws via hydrodynamic and  viscous limits, (iii) analysis of the
              structure of shock waves  for spherically symmetric three dimensional fluid
              flow. The main  goal is the understanding of the dynamics of these highly 
              nonlinear phenomena and applying this insight to interpretation  of the
              motivating physical problems.  The technical approach to  the above research
              will be to (i) examine cluster Boltzmann like  dynamics and try to simulate van
              de Waals intermolecular  attractions to develop discrete velocity phase
              transition models:  (ii) apply self similar scaling methods to recover
              hydrodynamic  and viscous limits for systems of conservation laws, (iii) 
              impliment the viscous self similarity method to the analysis of  spherically
              symmetric gas dynamics (conservation laws of mass,  momentum, energy).
