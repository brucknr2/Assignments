Abstract    :
                     9406485   Lamphere       This project involves the dissertation research
              of a student  of cultural anthropology from the University of New Mexico.  The 
              student will conduct an ethnographic study of Salvadoran  immigrants to the US,
              living in Los Angeles.  The question is to  understand how migrants use new
              concepts of ethnicity -- as  Latinos in an Anglo-Saxon country, and as
              Salvadorans -- when  their political identity is local in their home country --
              to  construct their political identities and mobilize support, often 
              transnational, to sustain productive and meaningful lives.  The  techniques
              used consist of ethnographic participant observation,  and formal interviews of
              immigrants to understand these  transplanted individuals relations to and
              understandings of the  national state.       This research is important because
              transnationalism is a  dominant fact of our world.  Increased understanding of
              how  people change their identities, and construct new political  identities to
              establish lives in new places and maintain  connections with their home places
              can help us design programs to  ameliorate problems and facilitate positive
              adjustment.   The basic question is important -- understanding how Salvadorans 
              living in the US adopt Salvadoran nationalism (missing to a large  extent at
              home) and Latino ethnicity as coping mechanisms to help  develop successful
              lives in the US will be valuable.
