Abstract    :
              With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program, Dr. Billups will   synthesize
              very reactive compounds of theoretical interest under   conditions of matrix
              isolation in argon near zero degrees Kelvin.   Structures of these compounds
              will be determined by low temperature   x-ray, FTIR, and UV/visible
              spectroscopy. Bifunctional cycloproparenes   will be synthesized and
              polymerized with silver ion catalysis to produce   a series of new aromatic
              materials including polyacenes,   polyphenanthrenes, molecular strips, and
              novel graphite-like molecules   with holes.    A major focus of the research of
              Dr. Billups is the synthesis of unique   organic compounds through new
              procedures discovered in his laboratory.   These novel approaches will create
              new substances that have interesting   bulk properties for the construction of
              new materials. The use of   reactive metal atoms will cause organic compounds
              to react by processes   that are unconventional and will  transform 
              hydrocarbons  into useful   substances.
