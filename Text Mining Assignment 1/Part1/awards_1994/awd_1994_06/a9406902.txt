Abstract    :
              9406902  Hester    With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Thomas Hester
              and  his colleagues will continue archaeological excavation at the  site of
              Cobweb Swamp, Belize. In 1987, during the course of  survey and test pitting in
              the area surrounding the known Mayan  site of Colha, Dr. Hester discovered
              highly patinated stone  artifacts which stratigraphically underlay Mayan
              artifacts.  Additional excavation in 1991 and 1993 yielded materials 
              radiocarbon dated to 2500 to 1400 BC. This predates the earliest  known Mayan
              presence in the region. Dr. Hester and colleagues  will now return to the site
              and excavate a board area to  determine the extent and nature of the
              occupation. He hopes to  recover abundant lithics as well as floral and faunal
              remains and  on this basis both describe this pre-Mayan culture and determine 
              its relationship to later Mayan occupation of the region. He will  also obtain
              material for additional radiocarbon dating, collect  pollen to reconstruct
              environment, and attempt to determine how  this changed over time.    The
              origins of the Mayan peoples who inhabited lowland Middle  America are not
              known. In Belize the earliest Mayan site dates to  about 1200 BC and by that
              time the roots of Mayan civilization  has been established. Archaeological data
              from earlier periods  exists, but it is minimal and does not come from 
              stratigraphically secure, well dated contexts. Cobweb Swamp  however is
              different and is important for this reason. It is  unclear whether Mayan
              culture emerged from this earlier pre-  ceramic context or if Mayan peoples
              entered the region from  elsewhere. The question is important because it bears
              on our  understanding of how complex culture developed in heavily  forested
              tropical environments.    This research is significant for several reasons. It
              will  increase our understanding of how complex societies arise and  will
              provide data of interest to many archaeologists.
