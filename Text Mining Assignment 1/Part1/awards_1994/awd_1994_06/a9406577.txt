Abstract    :
              9406577  Gaber       The PI, Dr. Richard Gaber, proposes to conduct genetic  and
              molecular analyses of K+ transporters in the yeast  Saccharomyces cerevisiae. 
              The proposal has four aims.  These are to investigate by molecular and genetic
              methods:  1)  the potassium transporting glucose transporters.  A  detailed
              analysis of potassium uptake by one of these  transporters, HXT3, will be
              carried out.  An extensive  collection of spontaneous suppressor mutations in
              HXT3 will  be obtained and the nature of each suppressor mutation will  be
              determined.  Their effects on potassium/glucose  stoichiometry, glucose
              transport kinetics and substrate  specificity will be determined.  2)  Genetic
              and molecular  analysis of potassium transporting amino acid transporters  will
              be carried out.  Some trk1d trk2d suppressors do not  show dependency on
              glucose.  DNA sequence analysis of one of  these, RPD4-1, revealed that it
              encodes a new member of a  family of genes  that encode amino acid 
              transporters.  Further experiments will determine whether  this mutant 
              transporter mediates potassium uptake, and if so, whether  potassium uptake is
              dependent  on co-transport of the  permeant amino acid.  3)  Genetic and
              molecular analysis of  additional trk1d and trk2d suppressors will be carried
              out.  Genetic analysis of the collection of these suppressors will  be
              completed and a representative of each genetically  distinct locus will be
              cloned and sequenced.  The collection  contains at least two more suppressors
              of interest, RPD7,  represented by 10 independent dominant alleles, and rpd6-1,
               which is allelic to VPS16, a gene encoding a vacuolar  sorting protein.  4) 
              Suppressor mutations will be targeted  to specific transporters.  %%%  Simple
              mutations in sugar transporters can confer upon these  proteins the ability to
              transport potassium ions thus  suppress the potassium-uptake-defective
              phenotype of  Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells deleted for their normal 
              potassium transporters.  These suppressor mutations alter   single amino acids
              within putative membrane spanning domains  to confer potassium/sugar
              co-transport.  A similar  suppressor mutation in a putative amino acid
              transporter has  also been found.  These novel transporters offer a unique 
              opportunity to study the molecular basis of solute  transport.  ***
