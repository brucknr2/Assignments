Abstract    :
              9406026  Molnar      The PIs will use laboratory and numerical experiments to
              examine  convective instability of mechanically thickened boundary layers,  in
              order to understand mantle dynamics beneath growing mountain  belts where
              crustal thickening occurs.  The thermal instability  results from the lateral
              thermal gradients resulting from the  cooler root, and may result in some of
              the know pecularities of  mountain belts.  ****
