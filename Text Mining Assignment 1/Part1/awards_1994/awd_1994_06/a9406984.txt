Abstract    :
              This main thrust of this research is the performance modeling of  routing
              algorithms.  Almost all prior research work on oblivious  and adaptive routing
              using virtual channel flow control relies on  simulation for performance
              prediction.  Although simulation can  mimic a physical system quite accurately,
              it is very expensive in  terms of computation time.  The analytical models
              being developed  will be quite effective in evaluating various routing
              algorithms  and architectural features, and are much more efficient than 
              simulation.  The project is also investigating the fault-tolerant  properties
              of adaptive routing algorithms.
