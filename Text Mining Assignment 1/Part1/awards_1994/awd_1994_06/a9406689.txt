Abstract    :
              9406689  Smith  PI and an interdisciplinary team, including Mexican collaborator
               Miguel Tellez (UNAM-BC), will integrate old and new sedimentologic  and
              biostratigraphic studies to produce a comprehensive geologic  map of the
              Vizcaino fore-arc basin.  Compiled data, including  strain analyses, will be
              used to interpret basin history and  tectonic evolution of the southwestern
              North American plate edge.   Paleo-magnetic evidence for long-distance
              translation will be  evaluated.  Combined with prior studies, this work will
              provide a  broad evaluation of this plate margin for the last 100 million 
              years.
