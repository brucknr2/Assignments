Abstract    :
              9406917  McCaffrey       During oblique plate convergence, the faults that take
              up the  strain can more oblique to the suture in sympathy to the oblique 
              convergence, or they can be partitioned with some being orthogonal  thrusts and
              others orogen-parallel strike-slip faults.  This  project will extend prior
              work on the partitioning of oblique  subduction in oceanic settings to
              continental setting.  factors  that control the style of deformation associated
              with oblique plate  convergence will be constrained by conducting
              three-dimensional  finite-element numerical experiments.  Results are expected
              to shed  light on how strain is partitioned in oblique continental plate 
              convergent situations.
