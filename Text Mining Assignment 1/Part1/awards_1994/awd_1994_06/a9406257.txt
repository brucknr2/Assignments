Abstract    :
              9406257  Constable      The PIs will visit Sao Miguel in the Azores to collect
              samples for  paleomagnetic study from the dated lava beds.  These measurements 
              will be used to investigate the local behavior of the geomagnetic  field over
              the last 4 million years.  The data will also be used to  improve the spatial
              and temporal resolution of existing global  field models.  ****
