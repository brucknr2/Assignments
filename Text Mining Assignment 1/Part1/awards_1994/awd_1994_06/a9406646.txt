              Ledbetter  Dr. Ledbetter s previous work has used simple assays to measure the
              ability of cultured fibroblastic or epithelial cells to share small cytoplasmic
              molecules through gap junctions.  This cooperation can be inhibited by
              treatment of the cells with the sodium-pump inhibitor ouabain.  Furosemide, a
              modulator of Na+,K+, 2C1- cotransport, stimulates communication.  When
              kidney-derived epithelial cells are treated with the steriod hormone
              aldosterone, their ouabain inhibition is reduced.  Recent work has suggested
              that calcium changes mediate the effects of ouabain and that aldosterone s
              action may involve an unusual mechanism independent of the classical Type I
              mineralocorticoid receptor.  Dr. Ledbetter plans to pursue these findings as
              examples of interactions between regulatory mechanisms that effect ion
              transport and those that influence junction-mediated communication.  She will
              carry out these studies in her own laboratories as well as in collaboration
              with Dr. Norton B. Gilula at the Scripps Research Institute (during her
              sabbatical leave) and with Dr. Fredic S. Fay at the Univ ersity of
              Massachusetts School of Medicine.  The goal is to establish how these and other
              modulators of ion support influence cell communication.  She will use Dr.
              Gilula s collection of connexin-specific antibodies and nucleic acid probes, to
              study.   a.  connexin protein localization by immunofluorescent staining intact
              cells;             b.  expression of connexin-specific RNA and protein and
              protein electrophoretic mobility in cell extracts; and  c.  rapid changes in
              functional communication, measured by dye coupling of cells.  The PI will also
              use digital imaging microscopy and spectrofluorimetry of cells loaded with
              ion-sensitive indicator dyes, along with radioactive tracer experiments to
              correlate effects on communication with influx, efflux and steady-state content
              of calcium and potassium and cytoplasmic ph. %%%  The results should help to
              refine new modes for the interaction between ion-transport regulatory
              mechanisms and regulation of gap-junction-mediated communication. ***
