Abstract    :
              9406809  Lynch  The central theme of the proposed research is the analysis of 
              logically definable properties of random finite structures.  The  kinds of
              finite structures that will be investigated occur in the  theory of relational
              databases, descriptive complexity theory,  operating systems, and the analysis
              of algorithms.  There are two  motivations for examining random structures. 
              First, the  logically definable properties of many formal languages have a 
              very regular behavior on random finite structures.  For example,  every
              sentence in the language may have probability that  converges to a limit, as
              the cardinality of the random structure  increases.  Often, the definable
              properties of a language  correspond to some class of computational problems. 
              Then the  regularity condition can be exploited to show that some problems  are
              not in the class:  if a problem does not satisfy the  regularity condition,
              then it does not belong to the class.  The  other motivation is that many
              computational processes, even  deterministic ones, are unpredictable because
              their inputs are  unpredictable.  Then in order to estimate the likelihood or 
              frequency of events, probabilistic analysis is necessary.  The  events be
              investigated include satisfaction of database queries  and deadlock in
              multiprogramming systems.  Both of these are  definable in certain formal
              languages.
