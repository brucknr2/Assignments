Abstract    :
              With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program Professors Warner and  
              Jebaratnam of Northeastern University will synthesize and test a DNA site  
              specific cleavage reagent containing a specific recognition element   tethered
              on both ends with  didiazonium ion precursors. Efforts will be   made to
              identify and enhance site specific cleavage of DNA using metal   ion catalysis
              to generate radicals and to study the site specific   cleavage caused by the
              generation of the tethered phenyl cations.     This project will undertake the
              design of unique carbon based compounds   which will  break large polymer
              molecules of DNA at selected bonds in the   structure  into smaller
              identifiable components. The successful design of   this technology could
              impact studies such as the human genome project,   the genesis of genetic
              diseases, and genetic engineering.
