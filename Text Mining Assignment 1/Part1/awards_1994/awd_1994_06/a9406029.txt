Abstract    :
              9406029  Wells       The Death Valley region is the most extended crustal
              section  in the western Basin and Range Province.  Numerous studies have led 
              to two models with varying predictions for the slip rates along the 
              strike-slip faults.  This project will employ tectonic land forum  techniques
              and new isotopic surface dating methods to elucidate the  rate and style of
              deformation of the Black Mountains terrane in  Death Valley, a parameter
              difficult to determine by other means.   Results will help discriminate between
              the competing models and  should also make a significant contribution to the
              application of  isotope geochemical techniques to geomorphology problems
