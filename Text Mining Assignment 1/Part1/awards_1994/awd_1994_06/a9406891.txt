Abstract    :
              9406891  Schore  The focus of this research is to investigate metal-catalyzed 
              coupling of dissimilar terminal alkynes and metal-catalyzed 
              cocyclotrimerizations using polymer-linked substrates. The  study of
              polymer-derived chemoselectivity control in polar and  pericyclic reactions and
              the application of polymer methodology  to free radical organic reactions will
              also be undertaken.  %%%  With this renewal award, the Synthetic Organic
              Program is  supporting the research of Dr. Neil E. Schore and Dr. Mark J. 
              Kurth of the Department of Chemistry at the University of  Califrnia, Davis. 
              The two investigators will focus their work  on developing methodologies to
              prepare and evaluate reactive  polymer systems for use in organic synthesis.
