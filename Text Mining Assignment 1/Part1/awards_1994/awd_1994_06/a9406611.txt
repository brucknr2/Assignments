Abstract    :
                The objective of the proposed research is to understand the 
              interrelationships among (a) the complexity of problems, (b)  the algebraic, 
              combinatorial, or graphical structure of  problem instances, and (c) the
              methods  used to describe  problem instances.  Further given this
              understanding, this  research will develop when possible more efficient 
              algorithms for the problems  considered.    Research will be carried out on
              several different fronts as  follows:  Work on succinctly-described objects is
              carried out to better  understand how the structure of the  description can be
              used to efficiently  solve the problem  instances described. Very efficient
              structure-preserving  reductions are used to identify problem similarities not 
              adequately  captured by polynomial time or log space  reductions.  Work on
              efficient  approximation algorithms and  scheme is carried out for hard
              problems  including  PSPACE- and EXPTIME-hard problems.  Finally, work is
              initiated  on the average case complexity of several hard    natural decision,
              optimization, and approximate optimization  problems.
