Abstract    :
              Funds are provided for development of a unique device for  the simultaneous
              application of uniaxial stress and  hydrostatic pressure to semiconductor and
              high-temperature  superconductors. Using the Boundary Element Method, the 
              device is calculated to withstand 1.4 GPa hydrostatic  pressure and 1 GPa
              uniaxial stress with a safety factor of  1.5. High-pressure experiments are
              important for the study  of high-temperature superconductors, and for the
              testing of  theoretical models to acquire clues for the improvement of  the
              compounds. The application of an external stress to a  semiconductor is also
              significant due to the modification of  the band structure. Currently, enormous
              effort is being  expended in order to engineer the band structure of 
              semiconductors for improved electronic and optoelectronic  devices. The device
              to be developed in this work will be  used in the investigation of laser diodes
              owing to the  commercial importance of this area.
