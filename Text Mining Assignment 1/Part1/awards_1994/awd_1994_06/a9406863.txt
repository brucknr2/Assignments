Abstract    :
              This award supports work on two sets of major problems in  commutative algebra. 
              The principal investigator will work on  Serre's conjecture on interesection
              multiplicity of modules and  Chow groups of a complete ramified regular local
              ring.  He will  also work on the canonical element conjecture of Hochster and 
              related problems.  This research is concerned with a number of questions in 
              commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.  Algebraic geometry  studies
              solutions of families of polynomial equations.  One can  either study the
              geometry of the solution set or approach  problems algebraically by
              investigating certain functions on the  solution set that form what is called a
              commutative ring.  This  dual perspective creates a close connection between
              commutative  algebra and algebraic geometry.
