Abstract    :
              9406745  Freese       Research in theoretical astrophysics will involve an 
              examination of the occurrence of phase transitions in the early  universe.  Two
              specific phenomena are studied.  The first  concerns the rapid expansion of the
              universe not long after its  beginning, and the research focuses on the
              mechanism for this  inflation.  The second concerns the effects arising from
              the  binding of quarks into ordinary particles.  Research in this area  focuses
              on the formation of "stringy" objects that accompany this  transition.  The
              results of the work provide a clearer picture of  what happens during a
              critical period in the evolution of the  universe.  ***
