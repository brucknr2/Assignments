Abstract    :
              9406520  McEnroe      The PI will investigate the optical mineralogy and
              magnetic properties of selected samples of high-grade metamorphic rocks exposed
              in the Adirondack Mountains that cooled during the Grenville orogeny about 1050
              my ago.  She will produce a selected suite of high-quality Grenville
              paleomagnetic poles, which have been lacking until now.  After this pilot study
              using paleomagnetic and rock magnetic techniques, she will utilize the results
              to select a broader suite of samples for a full determination of reliable
              Grenville paleopoles for the Adirondack Mountains.  ****
