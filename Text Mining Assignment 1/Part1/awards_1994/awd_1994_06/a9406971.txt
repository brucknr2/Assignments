Abstract    :
              9406971  Rodl    This U.S.-Polish Joint Cooperative Research in Probabilistic 
              Combinatorics is between Drs. Vojtech Rodl and Dwight Duffus of  Emory
              University and Drs. Michal Karonski, Tomasz Luczak, and  Andrzej Rucinski of
              the Institute of the Department of Discrete  Mathematics of Adam Mickiewicz
              University in Poznan.  The  problems addressed in this research belong to
              probabilistic  combinatorics.  They either deal with properties of random 
              structures or are expected to be solved by probabilistic means.   The Polish
              investigators are experts in the theory of random  graphs, which, besides its
              own interest, provides powerful tools  for solving many hard problems. 
              Specifically, the researchers  will examine: (1) extremal and Ramsey type
              properties of random  structures; (2) probabilistic approach to some extremal
              and  Ramsey-type problems; (3) matchings in random graphs and  hypergraphs; (4)
              phase transition in graph processes with bounded  maximum degree; and (5)
              enumeration of order preserving maps.      This proposed research in
              mathematics and computer science  fulfills the program objectives of advancing
              science by enabling  leading experts in the U.S. and Poland to combine
              complementary  talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual 
              interest and competence.  ***
