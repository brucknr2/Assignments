Abstract    :
              9406348  Cozarelli         The Program in Mathematics and Molecular Biology
              (PMMB) promotes  the discovery and expansion of the applications of
              mathematics,  including statistics and computer science, to molecular biology
              Because  of its precise measurement techniques, molecular biology appears now
              in  the position that physics was a century ago, ready for an explosion of 
              productivity and new insights arising from interactions with  mathematics.     
               Although administered through the University of California at  Berkeley, this
              is a Program without walls, a group unified by a common  goal. PMMB enables the
              collaboration of experimental biologists with  mathematicians, professions
              often viewed as disparate. PMMB members  apply state-of the-art mathematics and
              computational techniques to the  design and analysis of biology experiments.
              PMMB provides a forum for  mathematicians and biologists with interesting
              problems and a  commitment to the application of mathematics to molecular
              biology.       The Program uses three major mechanisms to achieve this 
              interdisciplinary collaboration. (1 ) An active fellowship program and 
              well-attended annual scientific meetings draw particularly the younger 
              scientists into the area of study and provide support for  interdisciplinary
              training. (2) The Program actively promotes the  education of the general
              mathematical and biological audiences on the  potentialities of the field
              through presentations and tutorials at  national meetingst focused small
              meetings, individual seminars,  courses, and didactic articles. (3) The Program
              provides modest direct  support for interdisciplinary studies by the members,
              their students  and postdoctoral associates, fostering a network of
              interactions among  the members for productive collaborations.
