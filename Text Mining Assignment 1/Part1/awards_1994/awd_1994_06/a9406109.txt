Abstract    :
              9406109  Furman  This is part of long-term research program that integrates 
              field, geochronologic, geochemical, isotopic, petrographic  and experimental
              data on young lavas to determine the  dynamics of continental rift volcanism. 
              The Rungwe volcanic  province in Tanzania was selected for detailed study
              because  samples for m this area will contribute to understanding  both
              large-scale geodynamic problems and regional tectonic  questions.  A
              fundamental  objective is to investigate the  geochemical consequences of
              mixing between asthenospheric  and lithospheric source melts.  A second
              objective is to  document temporal variations in lava geochemistry at 
              individual volcanic centers.  All samples analyzed in this  study are currently
              in hand; only fresh samples of young  lavas will be used.  High quality
              petrographic, mineralogic  and geochemical (including incompatible trace and
              rare earth  element) data will be interpreted in conjunction with  available
              isotopic (Sr, Nd, Pb, O, He) data on the same  samples.  The investigation at
              Rungwe will enable both local  and regional syntheses of data on the dynamics
              of  asthenosphere-lithosphere interaction in the genesis of  continental rift
              volcanism.
