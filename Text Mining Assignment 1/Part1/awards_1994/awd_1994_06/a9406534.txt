Abstract    :
              9406534  Mayock  Chestnut Hill College requests support from NSF for connection
              of  its campus network to PREPnet.  PREPnet is the midlevel network  located in
              the state of Pennsylvania.  PREPnet will provide  operations management and
              information services and it will give  Chestnut Hill College connection to the
              NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 -   45 million bits per second) National Backbone
              network.    The college needs greater functionality and network speed to be 
              able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers  along with
              being able to implement a more reliable mail system.  Students and faculty
              research will benefit from the link.  This is  also a unique opportunity for
              the school to explore innovative  educational resources.
