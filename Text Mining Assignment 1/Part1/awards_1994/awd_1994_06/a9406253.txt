Abstract    :
              9406253  Hollister       It is widely recognized that in the development of many
               orogenic belts there was a phase of rapid exhumation of hot  crystalline
              rocks, giving rise to nearly isothermal decompression  at peak temperature and
              clockwise PTt paths.  Several recent  studies in the Himalayas have focused on
              phases in the development  of the Himalayan orogen consisting of high
              temperature  decompression.  One of the continuing problems is identifying the 
              heat source for forming the migmatites in the middle crust, and  several
              conflicting models have been proposed.  This research is to  obtain well
              constrained metamorphic P-T data and interpretation of  P-T-time-deformation
              paths in order to constrain models pertaining  to the question of how migmatite
              can be formed in or tectonically  transported into the middle crust.  Results
              will help understand  the common occurrence of rapid exhumation of hot
              crystalline rocks  in the cores of many orogenic zones.
