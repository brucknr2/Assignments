Abstract    :
              9406570  Hanna  West Shore Community College requests support from NSF for a 
              connection of its campus network to Michnet and NSFNET.  Michnet  is the
              midlevel network located in the state of Michigan that  will provide operations
              and network information services.  It  will give West Shore Community College a
              56 thousand bits per  second connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45
              million  bits per second) National Backbone network.    The College needs
              greater functionality and network speed to be  able to access supercomputers,
              libraries, and make file transfers  along with being able to implement a more
              reliable mail system.  Students and faculty research will benefit from the
              link.  This  is also a unique opportunity for the school to explore innovative 
              educational resources.
