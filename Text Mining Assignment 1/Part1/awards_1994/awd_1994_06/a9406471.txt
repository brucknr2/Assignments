Abstract    :
              9406471  Moyer    Entomopoxviruses are poxviruses of insects and are related  to
              the more commonly studied vertebrate poxviruses such as  vaccinia.  The
              proposed project has relevance to  biotechnology, biological control, and gene
              expression.  The  PI's studies may open the way for a variety of applications 
              including genetically engineered biopesticides, vaccines,  and expression
              systems for foreign genes.  An entomopoxvirus  expression system would be a
              valuable tool for all these  areas in much the same manner as that of other
              insect virus  expression vectors have been.  There are potential uses of 
              entomopoxviruses in biological control of insects.  Grasshopper
              entomopoxviruses are presently being developed  for use in grasshopper control
              programs on rangelands.  Identification of viral genes associated with natural 
              virulence may offer clues to the control of insect  populations.  It is
              anticipated that the genetic engineering  methodology developed in this project
              will greatly aid in  the insertion of insect-specific toxin genes into 
              entomopoxviruses to enhance their potential efficacy as  biological control
              agents.  The PI's studies may also pave  the way for examination of the
              molecular aspects of disease  production of this as yet unexploited yet very
              different and  interesting group of viruses.  ***
