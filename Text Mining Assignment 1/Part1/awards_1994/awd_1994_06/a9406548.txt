Abstract    :
              With funding from the Organic Dynamics program Professors Garst,   Stickney, and
              Anderson at the University of Georgia will study the   mechanism of Grignard
              formation with particular emphasis on surface   effects that occur during the
              dissolution of magnesium metal as it reacts   with various organic halides.
              This study will help to delineate   mechanisms of Grignard reagent formation,
              provide knowledge about the   metal-solution interface and corrosion process,
              relate Grignard reagent   formation to classical theories of corrosion, reveal
              aspects of the roles   of polar solutes, and contribute to a knowledge base
              that will support   rational approaches to both synthetic problems and the
              problems of the   mechanisms of other dissolving-metal reductions.    This
              project will explore how a reactive metal like magnesium reacts with   organic
              halogen compounds to produce a reactive intermediate called a   Grignard
              reagent. In addition, the specific effects that occur on the   surface of the
              magnesium during the reaction will be studied and compared   with the 
              corrosion of metals that occurs in commercial products such as   cars, boats,
              and other consumer products.
