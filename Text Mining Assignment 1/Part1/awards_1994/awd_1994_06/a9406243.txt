Abstract    :
              9406243  McCallum  This research will provide a deeper understanding of the 
              processes that operate in the formation of layered mafic  intrusions,
              especially the Stillwater complex.  The proposed  research includes three
              subprograms:  (1) petrogenesis of  the platinum group element (PGE) ore zone,
              (2) origin of  macro rhythmic layering in gabbronorites, and (3) effects of 
              influxes of magmas into an evolving magma chamber.  The  study of the ore zone
              will utilize electron and ion probe  analyses and Pb isotopic studies to
              elucidate the  relationship between the host lithologies and the  stratigraphic
              sequence.  The second project will combine a  modeling approach with
              descriptive textural and  mineralogical data obtained by microprobe and image
              analysis  methods to test the predictive capacity of quantitative  models of
              layer formation.  The third project will utilize  mineral compositions
              determined by electron and ion probe  and Nd isotopic ratios of pyroxenes to
              determine whether  specific contact zones are the result of magmatic influxes 
              rather than fractional crystallization.  Study of the  Stillwater Complex is
              significant because it is the  repository of the largest reserves of (PGE) and
              chromium in  the western hemisphere.
