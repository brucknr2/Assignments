Abstract    :
              9406258  Carlson    This grant provides partial support for the  acquisition of
              a high-resolution, X-ray, computed  tomography (CT) scanner for innovative,
              sub-  millimeter scale studies of metamorphic textures,  vertebrate
              paleontology and physical anthropology  at the University of Texas-Austin. 
              Recent  advances in high resolution CT instruments,  especially with regard to
              X-ray focusing and  modular detector design, together with  sophisticated image
              processing software developed  for cross-platform usage, will allow 
              unprecedented, high resolution, non-destructive 3-  D imaging of many geologic
              materials for which  digital will be available both rapidly and in  formats
              that are readily exchangeable.  These data  will be made available for
              interested researchers  both interdepartmentally as well regionally and 
              further afield.  This facility will allow analysis  of a wide range of geologic
              materials of greatly  varying sample size and thus has great potential  for new
              advances in metamorphic petrology and  invertebrate paleontology that will
              available to  academic researchers at costs which will be  substantially below
              commercially available, high  resolution CT instrument time.  ***
