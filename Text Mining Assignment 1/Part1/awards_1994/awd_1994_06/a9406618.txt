Abstract    :
              9406618  McNulty       The Department of Mathematics and the University of 
              South Carolina will purcahse a Sun SPARC Center 1000 with 2  cpu's, 128 MB of
              RAM, and more than 6 GB of disk which will  be dedicated to the support of
              research in the mathematical  sciences.  This equipment will be used in several
              research  projects, including in particular:  and investigation into 
              irreducibility of some classical polynomials conducted by  Dr. Michael
              Filaseta, research in combinatorics conducted by  Dr. Jerrold Griggs, research
              on free resolutions in  commutative algebra by Dr. Andrew Kustin, and an 
              investigation of unavoidable patterns in strings of symbols  by Dr. George
              McNulty.  A common element in all these  investigations is their dependence on
              the use of algebraic  and symbolic computations as tools for discrete
              mathematical  experiments, on which to base the formulation of  conjectures,
              and as the means to carry out crucial  calculations as parts of mathematical
              proofs.  All four  mathematicians have made substantial use of computational 
              approaches in their prior research which have pressed the  limits of
              computational resources currently available to  them.
