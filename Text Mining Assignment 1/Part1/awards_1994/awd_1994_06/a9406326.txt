Abstract    :
              The diversity of neuronal cell types in vertebrates derives  from regional
              differences along the anterior-posterior (A/P)  as well as the dorsal-ventral
              (D/V) axes of the developing  nervous system.  Previous work has shown that A/P
              properties  are extremely labile during the initial phases of  regionalization.
               In order to investigate the corresponding  stages of neural regionalization
              along the D/V axis, this  investigator initiated a series of experiments
              examining the  early phases of D/V neural patterning using the amphibian 
              Xenopus as a model system.  Preliminary data suggest a model  in which D/V
              pattern in the prospective spinal cord region  is fixed at relatively early
              stages in contrast to the  anterior brain region in which D/V pattern remains
              labile  for a prolonged period of time.  Using tissue manipulations  in
              conjunction with molecular approaches, this proposal will  test and extend this
              model by systematically examining the  tissue interactions governing the early
              stages of D/V neural  patterning.  These experiments will not only provide a 
              framework for linking gene expression with biological  processes mediating D/V
              patterning events but will also  contribute to an understanding of the unique
              properties of  embryonic neuronal tissue, particularly its enormous 
              plasticity.
