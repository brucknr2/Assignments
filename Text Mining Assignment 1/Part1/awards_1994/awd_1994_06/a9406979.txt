              will purchase, at an estimated discounted price of  $48,374 ($24,187 requested
              from NSF and $24,187 cost shared  by UGA), computer equipment will be used for
              several  research projects, including in particular, bootstrapping,  function
              estimation, and inference for marked spatial and  spatio-temporal point
              processes.
