Abstract    :
              9406016  Marti    In the last few years, several cosmic ray produced
              radionuclides  (10Be, 14C, 26Al, 36Cl), as well as stable nuclides 3He, 21Ne
              and 22Ne  have been discovered  in terrestrial surface materials.  Some of 
              these nuclides are now employed as tracers in studies of  geophysical and
              geological phenomena and open up a new field of  study that is expected  to
              provide essential data on rates of  change in global change research.  Such
              studies require accurate  production rates, present and past, which are not
              currently  available .  We are using a direct method for the determination of 
              some present production rates by exposing relevant targets at  mountain
              altitudes.  Furthermore, we are evaluating the production  rate ratio P21/P26
              of the cosmic ray produced nuclides 21Ne and 26Al   by isotopic measurements of
              Ne in samples whic1h were exposed for  104-1047a.  Our experimental data are
              consistent  with inferred  neutron reactions in a 600 MeV proton irradiation
              experiment  (Aylmer et al., 1987), but do not agree with theoretical 
              predictions.  Measurements of the 3He21Ne ratio show that 3He is  incompletely
              retained in quartz.  Therefore, 21Ne production rates  and accurate 21Ne10Be
              and 21Ne/26Al production rate ratios are expected  to provide essential
              information for the evaluation of erosion  rates and to define geological
              processes (uplift, variations in ice  cover, etc.)  Further calibrations, such
              as activation energies for  long-term retention of Nec, are still required, but
              we are now ready  for research  on global change issues.    We propose to study
              the long-term exposure history of the Antarctic  ice field (the major
              controlling unit of the sea level).  We plan  to evaluate the 21Ne records in
              quartz separates  of documented  rocks from the Allan Hills region and to study
              a section adjacent  to the ice field in which the radionuclides 26Al and 10Be
              were   measured (Nishiizumi et al., 1991).  These authors estimate that  rocks
              in this region may have been exposed for millio ns of years   without ice
              cover, but caution that the record of an integrating   stable nuclide is
              required to define the early history.  We plan to  also include samples from
              the same area which indicate very erosion  rates.  The purpose is to increase
              the recorded  time interval of  cosmic ray exposure which is limited by the
              "erosion equilibrium".
