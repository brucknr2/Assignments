Abstract    :
              9406690  Brown       In convergent margin settings orogensis commonly involves 
              emplacement of batholiths, deep burial and Barovian metamorphism of 
              supracrustal rocks, thrust stacking of terranes and strike-slip  displacements.
               The connection between theses processes is not  entirely resolved however. 
              The cause of deep burial and  metamorphism is commonly ascribed to thrust
              loading; this proposal  entertains the idea that large-volume magma emplacement
              could also  accomplish the required loading.  Similarly, large-volume plutons 
              present difficulties in explaining how they could be emplaced in a  convergent
              margin, as they presumably require dilatational space.   This project will
              critically examine these issues in the Coast  Plutonic Complex of British
              Columbia in conjunction with personnel  of the Geological Survey of Canada. 
              Results will test the  viability of the magma loading idea and will contribute
              to the  resolution of the space problem for large batholiths.
