Abstract    :
              9406965  Delaney  This project will test the hypothesis that sites of
              hydrothermal  discharge may represent the confluence of up flow zones fed from 
              two adjacent convection cells.  A program of 30 ALVIN dives on  the Juan de
              Fuca Rise in the northeast Pacific is designed to  confirm whether mixing
              between fluids derived from two different  sources explains the gradients of
              temperature and salinity across  the Main Endeavour field, examine whether the
              same mechanism  operates at the High Rise vent field, develops regional context
               of these systems by defining the spacing for all active sites of  high
              temperature discharge, and establishing what chemical  characteristics of
              fluids are shared on a segment scale.  ***
