Abstract    :
              9406135  Bebout       This award provides three years of support for a 
              technician who will be dedicated to assisting operations in  the stable isotope
              and noble gas geochronology laboratories  in the Department of Earth and
              Environmental Sciences at  Lehigh university. The technician will assist in the
               maintenance and operation of the two laboratories, will  assist visiting
              researchers and students who have limited  experience in the use of the
              instruments, and will assist  the Principal Investigator in developing new
              geochemical  analytical applications of mass spectrometry. Research and 
              teaching in the two laboratories include studies of mass and  energy transfer
              in the Earth's crust, with a focus on  shallow crustal environmental and on
              problems of the deeper-  seated tectonic settings of metamorphic and igneous 
              petrology.  ***
