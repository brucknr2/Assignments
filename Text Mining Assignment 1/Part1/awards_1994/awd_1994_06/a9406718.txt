Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9406718  Gustavo Larsen    This is an investigation of the use of
              sulfated zirconia supported on zeolites as solid superacid catalysts. 
              Zeolite-supported, sulfated, zirconia clusters are prepared and their physical
              form and catalytic activity studied.  An objective is to produce catalysts with
              longer lifetimes than bulk sulfated zirconia.  Test reactions include
              isomerization of   n-butane to isobutane, isomerization of 2-methyl-2 pentene,
              and synthesis of ethyl tert-butyl ether.   Characterization techniques used
              include X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray absorption,
              and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy.    Environmental concerns have led
              to a large increase in the demand for oxygenates as gasoline additives.  At the
              same time, environmental and occupational-health concerns are forcing a
              phase-out of the fluid superacid catalysts used to make these materials.  This
              study looks at a solid  superacid that could replace these dangerous fluid
              catalysts.  A portion of the effort also addresses the use of ethanol in motor
              fuel.  ***
