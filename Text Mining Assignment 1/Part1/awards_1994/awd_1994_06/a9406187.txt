Abstract    :
              9406187  Tracy         This  award  provides  70  per-cent  of  the  funding 
              required   for  the  upgrade  of  the  electron   microprobe  instrument  
              housed  and  operated  in  the  Department   of  Geological  Sciences  at the
              Virginia Polytechnic  Institute  and  State  University.  The  institution  is 
              committed  to  providing  the  remaining funds necessary for this  upgrade. 
              The  upgrade  will  provide  new  computer  control  of  the  instrument  as 
              well as a contamination-free vacuum  pumping  system.  The  electron microprobe
              at VPI is used extensively  to  obtain  images  of element distributions  in 
              geological  samples  with  micron  scale spatial  resolution,  requiring 
              modern  computer automation and a pumping system  that  will  not  contaminate
              the sample surface during long exposure  to  the electron beam.  ***
