Abstract    :
              9406740  Grodzicker    Study of the biological bases of learning and memory is 
              among the most exciting fields in neuroscience.  Progress is  currently very
              rapid, particularly at molecular, cellular  and neural systems levels. 
              Commonalities of mechanisms  appear to be emerging from studies of gene
              expression,  synaptic plasticity (LTP and LTD) and processes of memory  storage
              in invertebrate and vertebrate systems.  This  meeting is planned to bring
              together major laboratories and  practitioners in the field of learning and
              memory at  molecular, cellular, systems and behavioral levels.  The 
              participation of younger scientists will be encouraged.
