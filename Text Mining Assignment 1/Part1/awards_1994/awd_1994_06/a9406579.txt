Abstract    :
              9406579  Linduff    Under the direction of Dr. Katheryn Linduff, Mr. Gideon
              Shelach  will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will conduct 
              archaeological fieldwork in the "Northern Corridor" region of  China, an area
              which lies to the North of the Yellow and Wei  River Basin. He will employ a
              variety of data to examine culture  change in the period between ca 2300 - 1600
              BC. During this same  interval, large complex societies arose in the river
              basins  immediately to the South. While the prehistory of the latter  region is
              relatively well known, the Northern Corridor has been  the subject of less
              intensive archaeological investigation. Mr.  Shelach has reviewed the published
              literature. He will now  conduct systematic regional surface survey to locate
              sites and  will also study unpublished site reports and curated collections. 
              On this basis he hopes to trace culture change.    The goal of the research is
              to gain insight into the processes  which lead to the development of complex
              societies in different  environmental settings. While it is clear that such
              societies  emerged in the Yellow and Wei River Basins and that they were 
              agriculturally based, the sequence to the North is less well  understood.
              Archaeologists know that Northern Corridor people  were primarily pastoralists.
              They have assumed that innovation  spread from South to North and that
              development could be  explained within a Southern "core", Northern "periphery"
              model.  However the data to support this is minimal and Mr. Shelach has 
              proposed a model in which interaction between the two areas leads  to
              simultaneous change in each. The data he collects will permit  him to evaluate
              these two alternatives.    This research is important for several reasons. It
              will provide  insight into the emergence of complex societies. The results 
              will, likely, be applicable in many regions of the world. The  work will also
              assist in the training of a promising young  scientist.  ***
