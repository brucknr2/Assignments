Abstract    :
              9406929  Phillips       The Department of Mathematics at Michigan State 
              University will purchase a SPARC server 1000 (with  processors, hard drives,
              disk cards, etc.), and three Sparc  10 workstations.  This will supply the
              needed speed and  memory necessary for the successful completion of the 
              following research projects.    (i)  Dirichlet-type Problems with Polynomial
              Data   (ii)  Compact Hypersurfaces Determined by a Spectral  Variational
              Principle  (iii)  Mathematical Methods for Population Genetics   (iv)  Analyses
              and Computations of Problems in Various  Applications    (v)  Scalable
              Algorithms for the Algebraic Eigenproblem
