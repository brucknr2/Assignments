Abstract    :
              9406921  Ding  A source of surface-emitting green light by frequency-doubling 
              infrared laser beam in the waveguide consisting of asymmetric  quantum wells is
              proposed.  Quasi-phasematching is achieved by  growing many units of asymmetric
              quantum wells, each of which is  composed of two domains of multiple asymmetric
              quantum wells  corresponding to "left" and "right" symmetries, and therefore, 
              modulating second-order susceptibility along the growth direction.   The
              conversion efficiency can be larger than 1%/W.    The principal investigator
              proposes to subsequently implement  miniature and integrable correlators,
              spectrometers, and phase  detectors, based on the surface-emitting
              second-harmonic generation  using asymmetric quantum wells.    These devices
              can be eventually used in optical communications and  ultrafast detection.  ***
