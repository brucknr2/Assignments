Abstract    :
              9406722  KASPERSON       Equity concerns play an important role in the formation
              of  rule structures which govern environmental management  institutions. Yet
              how equity considerations influence  institutional development, and thus
              specific patterns of  environmental and social outcomes, is a largely
              underdeveloped  arena of research. This project will study how equity concerns 
              enter into the structure and performance of an institutional  format that has
              long been utilized for managing common-pool  resources, namely common property
              resource management systems.  The study will first examine how three types of
              equity  conceptions (procedural, distributive, and redistributive) are 
              embodied in the formation and operation of rule structures  governing natural
              resource property regimes. Second, an analysis  of how the resultant property
              regimes produce specific patterns  of resource distribution and environmental
              change will be carried  out. The research will involve an historical and
              comparative  study of two different ethnic groups, the Yi (the minority group) 
              and the Han (the majority) in a poor agrarian region located in  the
              environmentally-degraded Liangshan Mountains situated in  Sichuan Province,
              China. The methodology uses a diversity of  methods focussed on the collection
              of primary qualitative and  quantitative data through surveys, interviews, and
              the  examination of village records and legal documents.       This study will
              provide important new insights as to how  cultural differences in the
              conception of equity enter into and  shape institutional rules, producing
              differential effects on the  environmental and social outcomes within the same
              mountain  landscape. As a doctoral dissertation research enhancement award, 
              this project will also provide support to enable a promising  student to
              establish a strong independent research career.  ***
