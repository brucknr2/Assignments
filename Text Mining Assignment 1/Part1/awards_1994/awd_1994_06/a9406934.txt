Abstract    :
                Faeth   This project comprises a series of field and laboratory observations
              and experiments to examine the role of endophytic fungi in deterring herbivory
              on Arizona fescue and enhancing its competitive ability against other plant
              species.  The investigators are also determining the costs to the plant (in
              terms of reproductive fitness) of the relationship with endophytic fungi under
              various environmental conditions.  The investigators are also examining the
              effects of maternal (vertical) transmission of the endophytes on seed predation
              and seed dispersal by seed-harvesting ants.  The results of this research have
              important implications for the role of microorganisms in dynamics of
              plant-animal interactions and the organization of plant communities.    The
              results of this research have applications in conservation biology, rangeland
              management, and reclamation ecology.  The re-establishment of native grasses in
              reclamation and range management efforts may be seriously affected by
              relationships with endophytes.  These relationships may also affect native
              ungulates and introduced livestock.
