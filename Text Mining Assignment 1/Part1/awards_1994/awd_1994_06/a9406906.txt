Abstract    :
              9406906  Oehlert       The School of Statistics at the University of Minnesota 
              will purchase 9 SGI Iris Indigo2 workstations which will be  dedicated to the
              support of  research in the mathematical  sciences.  The equipment will be used
              for several research  projects, including in particular:  1.)  Computing 
              Environments and Interactive Graphics;  2.)  Statistical  Inference using
              Markov Chain Monte Carlo;  3.)  Graphical  and Computational Elicitation of
              Expert Probability  Structures;  4.)  Regression Graphics;  and  5.)  Linear
              Smoothing in  Environmental Data.
