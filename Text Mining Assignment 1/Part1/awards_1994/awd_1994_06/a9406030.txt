Abstract    :
              9406030  Selverstone       Considerable progress has been made in understanding 
              proterozoic terrane assembly in Wyoming and New Mexico, however an  important
              spatial gap in information prevents on overall synthesis.   This project in
              focused on exposures in the Big Thompson River  area, Colorado where an
              unusually good opportunity exists to obtain  pressure-temperature-time
              information by virtue of variable  metamorphic grade and suitable lithology. 
              Results should provide  a more comprehensive account of the processes involved
              in the  assembly of crustal blocks and their addition to cratonic North 
              America.
