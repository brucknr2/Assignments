Abstract    :
              A planning grant is awarded to design a H2 (n,p) 2n  experiment and to establish
              a research collaboration between  North Carolina A&T State University and the
              Traingle  Universities Nuclear Research Laboratory.  The PI would  spend this
              summer designing an experiment to measure the  neutron scattering length from
              studies of n+d scattering.  The goal is to try to resolve discrepancies between
              previous  measurements and from estimates of this quantity from pi+d  capture
              reactions.  A broader goal is to establish a  research collaboration.  ***
