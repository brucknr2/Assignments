Abstract    :
                   9406576       Seaman       This proposal to the Career Advancement Program 
                   represents a redirection in the PI's research toward       the application
              of isotopic and rare earth element       analyses to problems involving the
              origin of magmas.       In the past she has focused on interaction between     
               magmas within plutons and volcanic terranes, and has       used textural
              relationships to evaluate mixing an       mingling of magmas as processes to
              produce       compositional diversity.  The use of isotopic data will      
              allow her to focus on larger scale, more tectonic       problems of mechanisms
              of melt genesis in extensional       and compressional settings and the
              physical means of       producing a magma chamber.  She intends to use isotopic
                    and rare earth element analyses for modelling igneous       systems and
              studying tectonic problems through magma       genesis well into the future. 
              The proposed research is       on the timing of Acadian magmatism and on the
              origin of       bimodal volcanic rocks of the coastal volcanic belt of      
              Maine.   These rocks provide an ideal research problem       for age and source
              material determination, and for rare       earth element analysis.  This work
              will use U-Pb dating       of zircons to date four volcanic successions of the 
                   coastal Maine volcanic province and use Nd and Pb       isotopic analyses
              and ICP-MS analyses to complement       existing field work, and  major and
              trace element       analyses to constrain the origin of the materials      
              involved in the genesis of the magmas represented in       these successions.
