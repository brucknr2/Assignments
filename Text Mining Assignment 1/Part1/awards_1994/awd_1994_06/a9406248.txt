Abstract    :
              9406248  Halliday       This award provides funding for personnel costs 
              associated with the development of a prototype inductively-  coupled plasma
              magnetic sector multicollector mass  spectrometer to be operated in the
              Department of Geological  Sciences at the University of Michigan. The
              instrument  combines the advantages of very efficient plasma ionization  with
              the precision of multicollector magnetic sector mass  spectrometry. The
              University of Michigan instrument is the  first of its kind in the world, and
              the analytical chemist  that will be supported through this award will assist
              the  Principal Investigator and colleagues in exploiting the full  capabilities
              of the instrument. Specifically, the person  will assist in developing new
              methods of chemical  preparation of samples, understanding the chemical 
              speciation involved in laser ablation and the effects of the  processes acting
              within the plasma that affect transmission,  molecular interferences,
              ionization efficiency, mass  discrimination, and matrix effects. The scientific
               applications for which this instrument and technique  development is intended
              include isotopic studies of natural  fluid inclusions, high precision Rb-Sr
              geochronology, In-Sn  geochronology of sulfides, U-Th disequilibirum dating of 
              small samples, and Lu-Hf isotope geochemistry of atmospheric  particulates.
