Abstract    :
              9406448  ROSEMAN       International contract labor migration is an important 
              source of currency for developing countries as well as an  important source of
              labor for capital-rich but labor-short  countries. The purpose of this project
              is to examine the  mechanisms involved in the production and transmission of 
              opportunities for such migration in one of the world's largest  exporters of
              labor, the Philippines. Opportunities for labor  migration are produced through
              institutional actions in the form  of emigration policies at the national level
              and then transmitted  to communities and individuals through recruiting
              agencies, mass  media sources, and social networks. The research will be based 
              largely on structured interviews, undertaken in the Philippines,  of key
              individuals in government, umbrella organizations, and  private recruitment
              agencies. This information will be  supplemented with secondary information
              collected in the  Philippines which will be used to further explain the
              production  and transmission of overseas opportunities.       This research
              will make significant contributions to our  understanding of the international
              migration of contract labor,  an important source of contact between developing
              and developed  countries and an important source of capital for developing 
              countries. As a doctoral dissertation research improvement award,  this award
              will also provide support to enable a promising  srudent to establish a strong
              independent research career.  ***
