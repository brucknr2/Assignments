Abstract    :
              9406208  Davis       The Colorado Plateau is a large area of relatively
              undeformed  rock that nevertheless was distal to a series of tectonic stress 
              patterns during Sevier, Laramide and Tertiary time.  The plateau  stratigraphy
              is rich in porous sandstones in which deformation  bands form with strains as
              small as 0.1%.  Because these are work-  hardening features, successive
              deformations are likely to form new  sets of deformation bands rather than
              extensively reactivate old  ones.  This project will map deformation bands in
              suitable  lithologies and related them to large features (faults) of known 
              age.  After spatial correlations, the stress orientations implied  by the
              deformation bands will be inverted from band orientations  and a set of
              paleostress patterns for the Colorado Plateau  produced.  Results should
              provide a much better understanding of  the directions, magnitude and degree of
              localization of stress of  these events in the Colorado Plateau.
