Abstract    :
              McBryan  9406582  The goal of the proposal research is to develop effective
              parallel sparse linear systems solvers for solving the algebraic equations
              arising in the finite element discretization of elliptic coupled systems of
              partial differential equations.  These solvers will be based on domain and
              subspace decomposition methods for use in the solution of linear coupled
              multicomponent problems, such as the fluid-structure interaction problems.  The
              emphasis will be scalable, transportable algorithms.
