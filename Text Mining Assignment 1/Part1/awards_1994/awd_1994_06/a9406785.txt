Abstract    :
              9406785  Mizuno    This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative
              research  in computer operating systems and system software.  The 
              investigators are Masaaki Mizuno, Gurdip Singh of Kansas State  University,
              Mitchell Neilsen, Oklahoma State University and  Michel Raynal of the
              University of Rennes and INRIA (French  National Institute for Research in
              Computer Science and Applied  Mathematics).  The objective of their research is
              to study the  definitions and implementations of distributed shared memory 
              systems by developing a general framework for classifying  protocols and for
              evaluating efficient implementations.  They  will develop protocols suited to
              different computer  architectures. The U.S. investigators bring to this
              collaboration  expertise in mathematical analysis, computer architectures, and 
              software implementation.  This is complemented by French  expertise in broad
              areas of distributed computing.  The project  also takes advantage of a large
              array of equipment at INRIA,  including a distributed parallel machine (a
              Hypercube with 32  processors), which will be used in the implementation
              studies.    Distributed shared memory systems are important because they 
              simplify programming. This project will further understanding of  these systems
              and its results could be applied to replication of  databases and distributed
              file systems in a high performance  computing environment.  ***
