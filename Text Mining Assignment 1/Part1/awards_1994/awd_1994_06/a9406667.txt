Abstract    :
              9406667  Grodzicker  Abstract  The seventh annual "Mouse Molecular Genetics"
              meeting is scheduled  to be held at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, August
              31st -  September 4th.  The emphasis of this meeting has been and will 
              continue to be, the study of the mouse as an organism rather than  simple in
              vitro tissue culture approaches.  Topics to be discussed  include genetic
              approaches, the mechanisms of embryonic patterning,  the role of cell signaling
              in development, the regulation of  embryonic, neural and organ development, and
              cell lineage.  %%%  The meeting will include students, postdoctoral fellows,
              and  established investigators in a setting conducive to interactions  between
              the various levels of expertise.  The timely exchange of  results, strategies
              and technological developments in this rapidly  moving field is central to its
              progress.  ***
