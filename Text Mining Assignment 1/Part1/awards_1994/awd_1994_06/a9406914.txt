Abstract    :
              9406914  Shimizu  The 8 x 10 Km Horoman Peridotite (Hokkaido,  Japan) is a 
              layered upper mantle peridotite that contains a record of  melt segregation,
              migration and reaction processes that have  created considerable geochemical
              heterogeneity.  In a  collaborative effort with Japanese colleagues, F. Frey 
              (MIT), graduate student  E. Takazawa (MIT) and N. Shimizu (WHOI) are
              determining the  geochemical characteristics of Horoman rocks and their 
              constituent clinopyroxene.  These data have been used to  establish that:  (a)
              the main rock type, plagioclase  lherzolite, is a suitable source rock for
              mid-ocean ridge  basalts but that (b) the plagioclase-free lherzolites and 
              harzburgites which are relatively depleted in CaO and Al2O3  have reacted with
              an incompatible element-rich melt.  This  enrichment of incompatible elements,
              expressed by high light  REE/heavy REE abundance ratios, is commonly known as
              "mantle  metasomatism".  By studying the spatial extent of the melt- 
              peridotite reaction in three dimensions (an objective that  cannot be attained
              by studying mantle xenoliths), the  mechanism and scale of this process is
              being determined.  The results of this study will identify the sequences of 
              events and processes that create heterogeneous upper mantle  in an arc and
              oceanic tectonic settings.
