Abstract    :
              9406811  Leary    This U.S.-Azech workshop will be held in Springfield,
              Illinois,  during October 11-13, 1994, and will bring together experts from 
              both countries to discuss Carboniferous stratigraphy of various  Czech basins
              and correlate the Czech information on environments  of deposition with other
              regions of the world.  Dr. Richard L.  Leary of the Illinois State Museum will
              serve as the U.S.  organizer.  His Czech counterpart is Dr. Zbynek Simunek of
              the  Czech Geological Survey.  The workshop will focus on topics in  1)
              Carboniferous fossil plant taxa, assemblages, taphonomy,  paleoecology, and
              evolution;  and  2) their paleographic  implications.  Results are expected to
              yield refined dating of  first known occurrences that will aid research on
              plant  migration.  Better knowledge of similarities and differences in  species
              common to both the U.S. and Czech coal basin regions will  aid in measuring
              rates of evolution and should contribute to our  overall understanding of
              global climate change.    This joint workshop in paleobotany fulfills the
              program objective  of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading
              experts in  the United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary 
              talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual  interest and
              competence.  It is expected that the meeting will  foster new U.S.-Czech
              research partnerships as well as promote  dissemination of information on
              current research and methods in  Carboniferous Euramerican paleobotany.   ***
