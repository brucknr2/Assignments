Abstract    :
              This research explores algorithms and techniques for symbolic  analysis of large
              linear or linearized integrated circuits in the  complex frequency domain.  The
              approach is to extract transfer  functions of circuits in symbolic form.  In
              the case of large  circuits, approximate symbolic network functions, in
              expanded or  nested format, are generated.  Both perturbation-based, and tree 
              enumeration approaches are being used.  The symbolic algorithms and  simulators
              are being integrated into an analog design automation  system.
