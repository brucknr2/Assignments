Abstract    :
              9406614  Reed  This award supports Professors Irving S. Reed and P. Vijay  Kumar
              of the University of Southern California, together with a  postdoctoral
              associate, to collaborate in applied mathematics  research with Professors Tor
              Helleseth of the University of  Bergen, Norway, and Henning Stichtenoth of the
              University of  Essen, Germany.  In general, they are working in the area of 
              the interaction between algebraic geometry and coding theory.   A major focus
              of their collaboration is the study of  exponential sums over Galois rings, and
              the application of this  to the design and study of error correcting codes. 
              Another  significant component involves Grobner basis techniques, both  their
              computation over finite fields and their application for  the decoding of
              cyclic and algebraic-geometric codes.  To  complement the U.S. groups'
              strengths in error correcting  codes, Professor Helleseth contributes necessary
              expertise in  the theory of algebraic functions and their applications to 
              coding theory as well as experience with Galois rings and  Grobner bases.  He
              also offers access to massively parallel  computing machines in Norway which
              will be used for some of the  joint research.  Professor Stichtenoth is an
              expert on  algebraic geometry and a world leader in the area of algebraic- 
              geometric codes.  The combination of their talents creates an  extremely
              powerful collaborative team.       The proposed research is an
              interdisciplinary combination of  discrete mathematics, symbolic computation
              and algebraic  computation theory.  Results will contribute to advances in the 
              theory of exponential sums and new and improved decoding  algorithms for
              error-correcting codes.  Such results will have  useful applications in several
              fields of mathematics, computer  science and engineering.  ***
