Abstract    :
              9406146  Orcutt       This experiment is designed to provide direct
              observational  constraints on the distribution of melt and the pattern of 
              upwelling beneath a mid-ocean ridge.  Studies of electromagnetic  and seismic
              wave propagation in the mantle with arrays of ocean-  bottom instruments will
              furnish measurements that can be inverted  to find horizontal and vertical
              variations in velocity and  conductivity structure that can be used to test
              theoretical  models of flow.         An array of 47 ocean-bottom seismometers
              will be deployed  for six months on the East Pacific Rise at about 17 degrees
              south  to record teleseismic and regional earthquake sources.  P and S  waves,
              as well as other body wave phases and Love and Rayleigh  surface waves recorded
              by the array will be used to probe lateral  variations in mantle structure to a
              depth of 100 to 200 km and  out to several hundred km from the ridge axis.  The
              mail goal is  to establish whether there is a narrow region of high melt 
              concentration and low seismic velocities directly beneath the  ridge axis and
              to map its vertical and horizontal extent.  Another goal is to constrain the
              pattern of upwelling.  ***
