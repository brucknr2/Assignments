Abstract    :
              9406063  Beavan       This award provides one-half the funding necessary to 
              acquire new generation receivers for use with the Global  Positioning System
              (GPS). The receivers will be acquired by  Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty
              Earth Observatory and  will be used primarily by its geophysicists in geodetic 
              field campaigns. The University is committed to providing  the remaining funds
              necessary for this equipment  acquisition.       Research applications for the
              new generation GPS  receivers will include measurement of strain fields across 
              major fault systems, sea level monitoring and seismogenic  strain measurements
              along the Alaska Peninsula, and precise  positioning associated with airborne
              geophysical  observations (gravity and magnetic field) in Antarctica.  ***
