Abstract    :
              9406195  Kay  Throughout Tertiary time, Kamchatka has collected fragments  of
              continental crust (terranes) that formed as oceanic  island arcs and plateaus
              in the Bering Sea and the Pacific  Ocean.  Accretion of the fragments has
              resulted in a  subcontinental mass.  The process is thought by many to be  the
              main mechanism of present day continental growth.  Kamchatka is a particularly
              good site to study this type of  continental growth due to its youth, due to
              the availability  of information on similar but as yet unaccreted oceanic 
              fragments (especially, the Aleutian islands) and due to  widespread
              post-accretion magmatism that records conditions  at depth.  This investigation
              focuses on alkaline basaltic  magmas that originate in mantle that lies under
              the  Kamchatka terranes.  Existing trace element data on these  magmas lack
              typical signatures (e.g. high Ba/La, La/Ta  ratios), and support delamination
              models that call fro  wholesale replacement of mantle lithosphere by underlying
               Oceanic Island Basalt (OIB)-like asthenosphere.  Isotope  analyses (Pb, Sr,
              Nd) as well as additional trace element  analyses will permit identification of
              mas reservoirs and  quantification of mas fluxes related to fundamental 
              processes of crustal growth and consolidation.
