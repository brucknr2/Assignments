Abstract    :
              9406043  Tzeng       This project is a program of research in the construction, 
              analysis, and decoding of error control codes.  The primary  objective is the
              development to efficient error control coding  techniques for reliable data
              transmission and storage.  The  specific areas of investigation are (1)
              developing algebraic  methods for determining the maximum error-correcting
              capabilities  of cyclic codes and algebraic-geometric (AG) codes; (2) 
              constructing efficient algorithms for decoding cyclic and AG codes;  (3)
              bridging the gap between the ;more traditional cyclic codes and  the AG codes;
              and (4) developing efficient concatenated coding  coding schemes using AG
              codes.  For the determination of minimum  distance, the project will develop an
              approach based on Newton's  identities and their extensions. Closely related
              approaches based  on the shifting method of  van Lint and Wilson and the method
              of  counting the number of"sentinels" in a syndrome matrix will be 
              investigated.  The techniques utilized will both lead to minimum  distance
              determination and to a procedure for constructing  algorithms capable of using
              the maximum error-correcting  capabilities. Considerable is planned to develop
              links between  cyclic and AG codes.  Concatenated codes using convolutional
              codes  as inner codes and AG codes as outer codes will also be studies.   Both
              theoretical and practical issues will be addressed.   ***
