Abstract    :
              McKinley  9412937        This is a joint U.S.- Taiwan workshop on deep-ocean
              water and  ocean resources development proposed by Drs. Kelton McKinley and 
              Clark Liu,  University of Hawaii and Professor Huang Min-Chih,  National Cheng
              Kung University.  The invited participants for  this workshop are the top
              current researchers in the field of  ocean resources and systems.  The
              participants plan to use this  workshop to identify opportunities for
              international cooperation  in ocean resources and environmental technology. 
              The workshop  will delineate areas of mutual interest, set research priorities,
               and address causes for past failure in the collaborative efforts  with a view
              to enhancing future cooperative projects in this  area.  The results of this
              workshop will be published in a  proceedings outlining important issues and
              cooperative  opportunity in ocean resources development.  This workshop is to 
              be held on August, 1994 in Taipei, Taiwan.
