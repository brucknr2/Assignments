Abstract    :
                Chui  DMS- 9406935   This grant is to support an international conference on
              Approximation Theory and Related Interdisciplinary Topics at Texas A&M
              University.  The objective of the conference is to bring together researchers
              from various areas closely related to approximation theory.  These include
              Computational Mathematics, Computer-Aided Design, Harmonic Analysis,
              Statistics, and Wavelet Analysis.  The conference will also feature awarding of
              the newly created Vasil A. Popov Prize in Approximation Theory.   
              Approximation theory centers on the problem of finding mathematical models for
              naturally occurring phenomenon.  This ranges form the synthesis and analysis of
              discrete data to computer assisted modeling of ontinuous phenomenon, and uses
              techniques from several branches of mathematics.
