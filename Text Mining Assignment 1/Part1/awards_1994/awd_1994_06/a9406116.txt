Abstract    :
              9406116  Lane  In this renewal, PIs will continue and expand research on Chinese
               echinoderm fossils, with a goal to understand echinoderm  biogeography and
              evolution in the aftermath of Late Devonian  extinction event(s) leading to the
              Carboniferous echinoderm  diversification.  Work will also contribute to
              paleoclimatic and  paleogeographic analyses, augmented by comparative studies
              of  related faunas from Europe.
