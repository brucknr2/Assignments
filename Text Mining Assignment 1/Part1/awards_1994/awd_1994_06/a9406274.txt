Abstract    :
              9406274  Segall       This award provides partial funding (61%) necessary to 
              acquire a computer system upgrade consisting of six  workstations and
              associated peripheral hardware to be  installed in the Department of Geophysics
              at Stanford  University. The University is committed to providing the 
              remaining funds necessary to acquire the equipment.       The computing system
              is to be used by the PI,  colleagues and students in computationally intensive 
              research in earthquake seismology, crustal deformation, in  situ stress
              measurements in boreholes, tectonics, and fault  mechanics.  ***
