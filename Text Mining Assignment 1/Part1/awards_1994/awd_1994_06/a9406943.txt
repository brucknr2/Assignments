Abstract    :
                          9406943  Ecker, Joseph  The goal of this research is to construct
              the physical map of the genome of Arabidopsis Thaliana.  Arabidopsis has become
              the best studied reference flowering plant due to its unique features such as a
              small genome of about 100 Mbp, a low amount of dispersed repetitive DNA, and a
              large amount of accumulated genetic data.  A Powerful method of furthering our
              understanding of the genetics and molecular biology of an organism is the
              construction of a physical map of its genome.  The unique features of the
              Arabidopsis system makes the prospects of construction of a physical map and
              sequencing of the entire genome particularly promising.    Specifically, Dr.
              Ecker plans to map the genome of Arabidopsis by sequence tagged site (STS)
              content mapping of yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clones with higher
              informative simple sequence length polymorphism markers.  The objectives
              include (1) the identification of a large number of simple sequence repeats
              spread throughout the genome which will form the framework genetic map, and (2)
              construction of the physical map of the genome by STS content mapping of YACs
              using these markers.    Dr. Ecker plans to share his data by releasing genetic
              and physical mapping information, DNA sequence information and biological
              materials on a monthly basis.  All DNA sequence data will be submitted to the
              STS database at the National Center of Biotechnology Information.  All
              biological materials generated from this projects will be distributed through
              the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center at Ohio State University.  ***
