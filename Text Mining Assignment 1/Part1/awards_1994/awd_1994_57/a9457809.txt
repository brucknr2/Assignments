Abstract    :
               For parallel computing to become the vehicle of choice for a  broad variety of
              computing problems, not just regular numeric  ones, the  expression and
              exploitation of irregular parallelism  must be efficient.  This  research
              addresses the major challenge,  programmability, by 1) supporting the 
              expression of irregular  parallelism with concurrent object-oriented
              programming  languages  and 2) supporting the exploitation of irregular
              parallelism with  high performance routing networks and network interfaces.   
              Concurrent  object-oriented languages enable programmers to hide  concurrency
              and  distribution, allowing incremental  parallelization and also confining the
               complexity arising from  irregular parallelism to a small part of the program.
               However,  efficient implementation requires aggressive locality and grain 
              size  optimizations in the underlying compiler and runtime system.  This
              project is  exploring aggressive type inference and dynamic  data structure
              analysis  techniques to enable such program  optimizations.  Type inference is
              used to  discover program  control flow, and dynamic data structure analysis
              approximates  the program storage map.  Runtime techniques are also being 
              explored.  These  techniques are embodied in the publicly  available Illinois
              Concert System.  This system is being used to  develop a number of parallel
              application programs.
