Abstract    :
              9457978  Al-Qadi  The proposed research includes developing: two focused
              antennae,  an algorithm to identify internal deterioration, a method to 
              predict structural deterioration and field validation.  The  teaching proposal
              includes development of: an undergraduate  course on infrastructure assessment;
              a graduate infrastructure  management course; an undergraduate nondestructive
              laboratory; a  multidisciplinary course for infrastructure engineers and
              defense  personnel, and introduce multi-media in the civil engineering 
              materials course.  ***
