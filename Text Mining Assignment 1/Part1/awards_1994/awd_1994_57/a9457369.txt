Abstract    :
              9457369  Fu  With this National Science Foundation Young Investigator (NYI) 
              award, the Synthetic Organic Program of the Chemistry Division  is supporting
              the research and teaching activities of Dr.  Gregory C. Fu of the Department of
              Chemistry of the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  The focus of
              Professor  Fu's research will be the development of new reagents and  methods
              for organic synthesis with an emphasis on asymmetric  catalysis and the
              elucidation of reaction mechanisms.  The  systems of interest span the periodic
              table, ranging from  organolanthanide and transition metal complexes to main
              group  metal species.  The focus of Dr. Fu's teaching activities will  be on
              both undergraduate and graduate classroom work and  participation in the
              Department's graduate student tutorial  program.
