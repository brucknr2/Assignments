Abstract    :
              Realistic formulations of performance-driven layout are the focus  of this
              research.  Accurate models of circuit delay are being  sought.  These models
              include technology parameters, such as  capacitance, resistance, inductance,
              etc.  The approach is to study  delay-optimal trees to define an envelope of
              achievable routing  performance.  Methods for constructing near-optimal layouts
              are  being investigated.  Additionally, the routing problem is being  recast as
              one of constructing low-delay routing graphs where cycles  are allowed.  This
              can have the advantage of designs being tolerant  to certain types of open
              faults due to manufacturing defects or  electro-migration.
