Abstract    :
              John Stanton is supported by an NSF Young Investigator Grant from the  
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to develop and implement  
              many-body ab initio molecular orbital approaches to the study of  
              photochemical processes.  The approach is based on equation-of-motion and  
              Fock space generalizations of the coupled-cluster approximation for  
              electronic ground states.  Specific aims of the research include: 1) the  
              theoretical formulation and computational implementation of techniques   for
              calculating reduced density matrices, electronic properties and   analytic
              energy derivatives for final states parameterized by a class of   Fock space
              methods that allow a spin-adapted, size-extensive, many-body   treatment of
              open-shell states; 2) extensions of existing   equation-of-motion methodology
              that will permit application of these   methods to the calculation of
              nonadiabatic processes; and 3) the design   of algorithms that will make these
              theoretical methods applicable to   relatively large systems.    Photochemistry
              tends to drive many of the important chain reactions that   determine the
              complex chemistry of the stratosphere, as absorption of   solar photons
              typically leads to photodissociation.  Of current   importance is the
              photolysis and subsequent photofragment chemistry of   chlorine containing
              compounds, as these systems have unambiguously been   implicated in catalytic
              mechanisms leading to destruction of ozone in   polar stratospheric regions. 
              Stanton's studies of excited states of   these open-shell molecules will assist
              in their theoretical   characterization and detection by spectroscopic
              techniques.  His research   will also contribute to the calculation of
              potential energy surfaces for   excited states which can be used to simulate
              photodissociation events
