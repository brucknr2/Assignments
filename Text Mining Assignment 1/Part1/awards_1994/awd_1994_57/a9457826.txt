Abstract    :
              9457826  Wang         This research, supported by a National Science Foundation 
              Young Investigator Award, will focus on the mathematical theory  of control
              systems.  Research will be conducted in the areas of  (1) feedback
              stabilization for nonlinear systems using a Lyapunov  approach and (2) the
              relationships between "input/output"  differential equations and state space
              representations.         The National Science Foundation Young Investigator
              Award  recognizes outstanding young faculty.  This award recognizes the 
              recipient's strong potential for significant development as a  teacher and
              academic leader.
