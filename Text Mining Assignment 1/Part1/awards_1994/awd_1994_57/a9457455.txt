Abstract    :
              9457455  Hawley      The data from the observations of the magnetic activity in
              low mass  stars can be used as a tool to study the formation, evolution, the 
              interior dynamo and atmospheric structure, and possibly the age of  the stars. 
              A concerted program will be carried out to investigate  stellar activity in low
              mass stars through two large observational  surveys and a major theoretical
              modelling effort.  The surveys will  focus on low mass stars in open clusters
              and in the field of our  Galaxy, and will comprise both photometric and
              spectroscopic  observations.  From the data obtained by observing the stellar 
              clusters, a snapshot of the activity at a given age (and  evolutionary state)
              is obtained, while the relationship between  activity and mass (and internal
              structure) is best studied in the  field stars.  To further the observational
              effort, a new Michigan  State University (MSU) optical spectrograph will be
              designed and  developed and used for the observations.  It will employ both a 
              grating and an echelle mode, suitable for low and high resolution 
              spectroscopic studies, respectively.  Several students will be  involved in the
              design phase which should be completed in 1994 or  1995.  Finally, the
              modelling effort employs a sophisticated  non-LTE radiative transfer method
              together with a self-consistent  description of the entire atmosphere of a star
              from corona to  photosphere to make models of the stars. The combination of 
              observation and theory promises to give new insight into the  physical
              processes and evolution of magnetic activity in low mass  stars.    This award
              is to recognize an outstanding young faculty member in  science and
              engineering.  This award will enhance the career of the  faculty member by
              providing flexible support for research and  educational activities. 
              Cooperation with industry and institutions  that support research and education
              is encouraged.
