Abstract    :
              This research investigates modeling and estimation of power  consumption as well
              as techniques for minimizing power at the  various levels of design abstraction
              (layout, logic, register-  transfer and behavioral levels).  Principles and
              methods to guide  the design of power efficient electronic systems are being 
              explored; and the impact of availability of low-power design  techniques on
              chip, module, and system level designs is being  assessed.  Topics being
              investigated include: spatio-temporal power  estimation; state assignment for
              low power; power dissipation in  boolean networks; common subexpression
              extraction; and FPGA  synthesis for low power.
