Abstract    :
              9457964  Hemker     Dislocation motion in intermetallic alloys is known to be
              governed  by the dislocation core geometry, but attempts to capitalize on  this
              knowledge have been inhibited by the small number of  experimental observations
              currently available.  This study, which  is unique in that it provides a very
              quantitative measure of  dislocation core geometries by combining transmission
              electron  microscopy with computer generated image simulations, provides a  way
              of experimentally observing and characterizing dislocation core  structures in
              intermetallic alloys.  These quantitative  observations are used to link the
              atomic structure of dislocation  cores with the macroscopic mechanical
              properties in several  different intermetallic alloys.  It is known that the
              addition of  iron to nickel-germanium reduces the anomalous flow strength 
              behavior and eventually results in alloys in which the flow  strength decreases
              "normally" with increasing temperature.   Deforming a series of specimens that
              vary systematically in iron  content and relating the measured fault energies
              with the yielding  behavior of the individual alloys will provide valuable
              information  about the sources of the flow strength anomaly in all L12 alloys. 
               %%%  A fundamental understanding of the processes that control  dislocation
              motion in intermetallic alloys will allow alloy  designers to modify alloy
              stoichiometry to maximize both ductility  and high temperature strength.  ***
