Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9457014  University of Minnesota  P.I.:  Ellen Longmire      This
              research over the next year will include several projects in the field of
              experimental fluid mechanics:  Particle-turbulence interaction near solid
              surfaces, investigation of model downbursts, effects of trailing edge geometry
              on jet mixing, and the effect of flow structure on liquid sprays.  In the first
              set of experiments, we are examining the motion of particles in a lightly-laden
              impinging jet.  Particle image and particle tracking velocimetry are use to
              measure particle velocities and trajectories in the presence of coherent
              vortices of known scale.  Separate experiments with high particle mass loadings
              will attempt to examine turbulence modification by the particles and any
              resulting heat transfer modification when the impingement surface is heated. 
              In the downburst study, we will obtain horizontal velocity fields with PIV to
              examine both the development of azimuthal instabilities and near-ground
              velocity gradients.  In the jet study, we will perform flow visualization and
              velocity measurements to understand parametric effects on mixing in round jets
              with stepped and sawtooth trailing edges.  Finally, we will design and
              construct a facility for the study of sprays subject to varying turbulence
              level and structure.
