Abstract    :
              Automatic planning, as a sub-discipline of AI, has been around for  over thirty
              years.  While formal foundations of the field have  grown increasingly
              sophisticated, progress has been slow in terms  of applications of AI planning
              techniques to realistic problems.   An important reason for this state of
              affairs is the lack of  adequate understanding of search-control and efficiency
              issues in  planning.                                                          
              Accordingly, the PI proposes to develop systematic approaches for  improving
              efficiency of AI planning techniques, so as to facilitate  their application to
              realistic planning tasks.  Specifically, he  will (1) study the fundamental
              design tradeoffs in planning  algorithms, and use that understanding to design
              more efficient  planners, (2) start a multi-pronged project to integrate
              speedup  learning techniques, including plan reuse, search control rules, 
              derivational replay and abstraction into partial-order planning  framework, and
              (3) develop hybrid planning architectures capable of  facilitating structured
              interaction between planners and other  types of domain-specific specialists,
              including humans.  Through  industrial and inter-disciplinary collaborations,
              he proposes to  evaluate the resulting planning frameworks in realistic
              planning  tasks such as manufacturing planning.
