Abstract    :
              9457260  Roberts  This is an award to support research through a National
              Science  Foundation Young Investigator Award to be performed by the  Principal
              Investigator who was nominated and selected through  procedures contained in
              NSF 93-148, Young Investigator Awards FY  1994 Program.  This investigator's
              research plan involves work on  the interactions of trace metal ions with
              inorganic ligands.  These have important ramifications with respect to the
              manner by  which metals exert their toxic effects such as influencing the 
              mechanisms that are involved in formation of toxic methylated  metal species by
              sulfate-reducing bacteria.  This work involves  development of techniques for
              investigating the mechanisms of  electron transfer in reductive dehalogenation
              reactions of  polyhalogenated alkanes.    The treatment of contaminated soils
              and aquifers by stimulating  abiotic or microbial reduction can result in
              byproducts that are  relatively persistent and toxic as well as others that are
               readily biodegraded.  Results of this research may be applied in  engineering
              design of systems for remediation of contaminated  soil and aquifers to avoid
              the formation of byproducts that are  relatively persistent and toxic.
