Abstract    :
              9457907  Bershadsky  This activity in theoretical physics will continue the 
              investigation of the anomaly master equation.  This study is  closely related
              to the properties of the Kodaira-Spencer theory  of Gravity.  In addition, a
              study of topological massive field  theories coupled to gravity will be
              initiated.  ***
