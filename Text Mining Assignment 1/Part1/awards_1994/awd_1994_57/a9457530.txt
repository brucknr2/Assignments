Abstract    :
              Malony  9457530  This NYI proposal lies at the heart of the HPC software crisis:
              the performance evaluation and optimization of software developed for
              high-performance, parallel computer systems.  The central theme of the research
              is that the challenge of maximizing the productivity of HPC software developers
              can be best addressed by an aggressive integration of sophisticated tools for
              program and performance analysis into an HPC programming environment. There are
              four research focus areas that will be actively pursued with this grant: 
              parallel performance visualization; performance prediction and extrapolation;
              knowledge-based automation of performance diagnosis and tuning; and
              language-based parallel program analysis environments.  The plan for each area
              is to establish the fundamental principles and techniques, build prototypes
              tools for evaluation, integrate the tools into program development systems, and
              test the benefits of the research in real HPC application environments.
