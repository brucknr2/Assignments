Abstract    :
               In this project, aggressive instruction scheduling  techniques  for
              instruction-level parallel (ILP) processors are  investigated. ILP processors,
              such as superscalar and VLIW  processors, are  used effectively in both general
              purpose and  scientific computer systems. For  general purpose systems, the 
              high frequency of branch instructions creates the  need for  aggressive global
              scheduling techniques that support  speculatively  and conditionally executed
              instructions. For  scientific systems, cyclic  scheduling techniques such as
              software  pipelining have been developed to  aggressively schedule inner 
              loops. The four areas that are explored in this  project are: (1) Investigate
              issues associated with the software pipelining  technique and Modulo
              scheduling. These include scheduling while  loops, handling  loops with cross-
              iter\-ation dependencies and  removing the uniform initiation  interval
              restriction; (2) Formalize an operation-level intermediate program 
              representation that allows the application of well-known local  scheduling 
              techniques to achieve globally scheduled code. This  approach has been 
              successfully applied to Modulo Scheduling and is extended to acyclic 
              scheduling; (3) Develop a task granularity adjustment methodology, similar in 
              concept to vectorization, for software pipelining in a  superscalar/VLIW based 
              multiple processor system; and (4) Analyze the control architectures for 
              superscalar  implementations of existing processors by studying the hardware 
              and compiler design complexities associated with scheduling multi-way 
              branching and partial predication architectures.
