Abstract    :
              9457028      ABSTRACT  CTS-9457028  PI-Mulholland    The research explores
              fundamental processes and chemical pathways governing the formation of toxic
              combustion byproducts.  Experimental and computational studies are proposed to
              study ignition and extinction phenomena, carbon growth pathways to polycyclic
              aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and soot, and the pyrolytic transformation and
              oxidative destruction of chloro-organic wastes.  The experiments will be
              conducted in a drop-tube reactor.  Gas and liquid chromatography with mass
              spectroscopy, infrared and ultraviolet detection methods will be employed to
              provide isomer specific identification and quantification.  Coupled with these
              experiments will be the development of reduced kinetic data sets for
              quantitative analysis of rate limiting phenomena and the utilization of
              molecular orbital models help to identify reaction pathways.
