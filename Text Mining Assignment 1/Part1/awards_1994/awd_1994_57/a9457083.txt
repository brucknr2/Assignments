Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9457083  Northwestern University  P.I.:  Wesley Burghardt      The
              central theme of research in my group at Northwestern in the relationship
              between flow-induced microscopic structural changes in complex fluids, the
              resulting mechanical rheological behavior behavior, and further, the
              consequences of nonlinear rheology in more complex fluid mechanical problems. 
              Under NYI support, we will pursue three projects, (i) Flow-induced alignment in
              block copolymer solutions.  Ordered block copolymers are characterized by
              complexity at two structural levels.  Molecular relaxations are reflected in
              viscoelastic behavior.  However, the self-assembly of the polymers into ordered
              microstructures (such as lamellae) renders both structure and rheological
              properties highly anisotropic.  We will use flow birefringence to study the
              development of macroscopic alignment under flow, coupled with mechanical
              testing to study how bulk rheological behavior is affected by the average
              orientation state.  (ii) Constitutive instabilities in highly entangled
              polymers.  We will investigate two classes of materials where the constitutive
              behavior has been proposed to be subject to an unstable nonmonotonic dependence
              of stress on deformation.  Highly entangled polymer solutions will be studied
              in step strain, while so called living polymers (micellar surfactant solutions)
              will be studied in steady shear flow.  In both cases, we will utilize optical
              approaches developed in our laboratory for studying the complete stress tensor
              using the stress-optical rule.  (iii) Non-newtonian fluid mechanics. 
              Experimental studies will be conducted on well-characterized viscoelastic
              polymer solutions in complex geometries.  These efforts are directed towards
              developing an experimental database with which to test numerical simulations of
              viscoelastic flow, and discriminate among competing constitutive models.
