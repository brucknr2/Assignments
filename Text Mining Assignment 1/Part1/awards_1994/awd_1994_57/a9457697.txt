Abstract    :
              9457697  Yu  Conceptually new multifunctional polymers and new polymerization 
              methodology will be developed.  New conjugated photorefractive  polymers with
              enhanced quantum yield and charge carrier's mobility  will be thoroughly
              investigated.  New conjugated liquid  crystalline (LC) polymers and their
              unique properties will be  studied.  %%%  ***
