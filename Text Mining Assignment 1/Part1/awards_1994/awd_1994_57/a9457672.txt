Abstract    :
              This NSF Young Investigator Award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and
              Organometallic  Program will support research on transition metal compounds
              with heteroatoms by Dr. John F.  Hartwig of the Chemistry Department, Yale
              University.  The goal of the research is to bring the  catalytic effectiveness
              and stability of organometallic compounds to new areas of chemistry.  
              Organometallic compounds contain metal-carbon bonds; here new species which
              also contain  metal-boron bonds will be synthesized and studied for their
              potential as catalysts and as starting  materials for new materials.  Tungsten,
              niobium, iron, ruthenium, iridium and gallium  compounds will be prepred and
              emphasis will be placed on catalysis of reactions of alkenes.   In addition,
              catalytic metal-mediated coupling of carbon and nitrogen and of carbon and
              oxygen  will be studied.  Work on metal-nitrogen systems will also involve use
              of organometallic  compounds with peptides and DNA in which photolytic cleavage
              of the metal-nitrogen bond will  aid in the identification of intramolecular
              protein folding processes and other protein-protein or  protein-DNA
              associations.
