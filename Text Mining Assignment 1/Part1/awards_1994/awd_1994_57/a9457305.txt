Abstract    :
              9457305  Betti    This project is a NSF Young Investigator Award.  The subject
              of  the research is focused on bridge engineering analysis and design 
              features, including retrofitting concepts.  Research will be  directed towards
              analysis of vibration control systems for long-  span bridges, dynamic
              soil-structure, interaction effects, non-  destructive global testing, and
              evaluation.  Techniques for  bridge damage detection and the analysis of
              corrosion processes.  ***
