Abstract    :
              9457928  Gelfand  This NSF Young Investigator award is for condensed matter
              theory  including numerical studies of models for phenomena in which  disorder
              and quantum fluctuations play a crucial role (quantum Hall  effect and quantum
              antiferromagnetism) and for studies of fullerene  solids.  The teaching
              component includes the development of a  mathematical methods course including
              numerical techniques.  %%%  ***
