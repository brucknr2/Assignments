Abstract    :
              9457596  Blanchet  An NYI award will support research on the formation of high 
              temperature carbon solid lubricants directly on bearing surfaces  from the
              decomposition of carbonaceous gases.  Process models  incorporating kinetics
              and thermodynamics of the processes will  be developed and validated
              experimentally.  The feasibility of  controlling the deposition process will be
              assessed.  ***
