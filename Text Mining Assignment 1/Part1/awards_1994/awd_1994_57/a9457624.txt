Abstract    :
              This research project will explore principles of computational  decision making
              for single-and multiagent systems based on economic  rationality concepts.  For
              multiagent decision making decentralized  computational markets supporting
              distributed resource allocation  will be developed.  This market-oriented
              programming approach will  be applied to transportation planning, concurrent
              engineering, and  distributed information services.
