Abstract    :
              The use of adaptive and learing strategies in engineering systems  is  important
              for several reasons including increased  robustness  against  changes in
              operating conditions and errors in  data  and  modeling,  reduced  need for
              explicit programming,  and  improved  performance  over time.  However,
              although such  strategies  have  been  widely  used and studied, certain basic
              questions  such  as  "What are optimal strategies for adaptation?" and "How
              much  data  is  required?" remain largely unanswered.  Therefore, the  design 
              of  adaptive and learning systems is generally done in an ad  hoc  manner with
              little experience gained from on e application to the  next.   furthermore, 
              very  few  performance  guarantees  can  be  provided  for the algorithms used.
               The goal of this research  is  to  contribute  to the theoretical foundations 
              of  adaptive  and  learning  systems.  Some particular topics to be pursued 
              include  the  analysis of estimation and adaptive control algorithms under 
              arbitrary  disturbances, the study of fundamental limitations  in  system 
              identification,  and  understanding  the  role  of  prior  uncertainty and
              feedback in determining system performance.   The  primary goal is to obtain
              results on the fundamental capabilities  and  limitations  of adaptive and
              learning systems  in  order  to  allow more principled design and analysis of
              such systems.
