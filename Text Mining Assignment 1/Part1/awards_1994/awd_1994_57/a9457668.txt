Abstract    :
              Under this NSF Young Investigator Award Professor Seung Koo Shin will   examine
              photoinitiated reactions in ion-molecule complexes near the   transition state.
               Ionic reaction intermediates weakly held by   charge-induced dipole
              interactions are isolated in an ion trap or are   mass-selected with an ion
              reflector.  State-selective laser spectroscopic   studies provide details of
              structural and dynamic information about   ion-molecule complex mediated
              chemical processes such as SN2,   charge-transfer, and oriented orbital
              reactions.  %%%  With the experimental techniques available to him, Shin will
              be able to   examine on a microscopic level what happens when one molecule,
              sometimes   an electrically charged particle called an ion, reacts with a
              different   neutral molecule.  The weak molecular associations which are formed
              are   called complexes.  The study of these complexes gives information about  
              how reactions occur, and what products result under given starting  
              conditions.  These studies have broad application, especially to   atmospheric
              processes, including those involved in the formation of smog   an the
              destruction of greenhouse gases.
