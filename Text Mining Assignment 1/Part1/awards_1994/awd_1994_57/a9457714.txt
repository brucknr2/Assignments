Abstract    :
              This NSF Young Investigator Award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and
              Organometallic   Program provides support for research in bioinorganic
              chemistry by Dr. Charles G. Riordan of   the Chemistry Department, Kansas State
              University.  Water-soluble organometallic complexes   will be used as
              photolytic sources for carbon radicals which will be reacted with nucleic
              acids.    A class of cobalt complexes has been found to cleave both single- and
              double-stranded DNA.    Organometallic derivatives of these complexes will be
              prepared to deliver different kinds of  alkyl  radicals and the specificity of
              the attack of these radicals on DNA will be determined.   The  steric bulk of
              some of these alkyl radicals may result in sequence specificity because of  
              recognition of DNA's tertiary structure.  Also, methyl radicals produced in
              this manner will be   used as footprinting probes to identify
              metalloprotein-DNA binding regions.
