Abstract    :
              This National Science Foundation Young Investigator project is in the   general
              area of analytical chemistry, with a specific focus on the   characterization
              of environmentally relevant aerosols.  During the   five-year tenure of this
              award, Professor Prather and her students will   carry out fundamental studies
              on aerosol particles that are thought to   participate in a number of
              environmentally important reactions.  The size   and composition of individual
              particles are measured using a laser-based   gating system in conjunction with
              laser desorption and time-of-flight   mass spectrometry.  Particles composed of
              inorganic salts and   polyaromatic hydrocarbons will be investigated.  The goal
              is to identify   the particle characteristics important in controlling
              atmospheric   reactions.    This project should advance the state-of-the-art of
              environmentally   relevant analytical measurements, and will provide a more
              thorough   understanding of chemical processes affecting air quality. 
              Additionally,   this award will enable Professor Prather to further her overall
                professional development as a researcher and educator at the University   of
              California at Riverside.
