Abstract    :
              9457859  Nistor       This research, supported by a National Science Foundation 
              Young Investigator award, will involve research in "non-  commutative"
              geometry. This very active field is a program to  extend the subject of the
              usual differential geometry of space to  "non-commutative" settings that are
              typical of quantum mechanics  and other related phenomena. The work centers
              around new  character and index invariants previously pioneered by Nistor.     
               The National Science Foundation Young Investigator award  recognizes
              outstanding young faculty. The award recognizes the  recipient's strong
              potential for continued professional growth as  a research mathematician and
              for significant development as a  teacher and academic leader.  ***
