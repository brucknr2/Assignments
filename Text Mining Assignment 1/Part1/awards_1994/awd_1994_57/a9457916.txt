Abstract    :
              9457916  Falk  A program of research in the theory of elementary particles will 
              be initiated.  This will include a study of heavy quark effective  field theory
              and the properties of heavy quarks.  Another study  will be of the nature of
              the breaking of the electroweak gauge  symmetry.  ***
