Abstract    :
              In this NSF Young Investigator Award in the Physical Chemistry Program of   the
              Chemistry Division, Gruebele will use ultrafast laser techniques and   high
              resolution sources to study the dynamics of complex chemical   reactions. 
              Specific goals of the research are the study of   pathway-selective
              ion-molecule reactions, a better understanding of   energy relaxation to allow
              reaction control in large molecules, and a   better understanding of the
              dynamics of biopolymers.  %%%  The results of this research project will aid
              scientist who are   attempting to direct the pathways which can be taken by
              chemical   reactions by allowing a better understanding of what drives chemical
                reactions.  Another result is a better understanding of how biological  
              molecules such as proteins fold into their unique molecular   configurations. 
              Such an understanding has a variety of applications,   including the ability to
              tailor medicines for specific tasks.
