Abstract    :
              9457481  Swartzlander  The five-year experimental effort will be executed in
              three phases.   (I) Develop techniques (generation and control of vortices
              using  computer-generated holograms or spatial light modulators,  preparation
              of materials), laboratory and numerical experiments,  proof-of-concept
              demonstrations of novel lightwave technologies  (optical interconnection and
              logic, optical trapping, nonlinear  spatial filtering, sensing) using thermal
              nonlinear media, form  cross-disciplinary collaborations (some are already
              underway),  train Ph.D. and B.S. students, prepare lab for phase II.  (II) 
              Obtain state-of-the-art nonlinear materials from collaborators 
              (semiconductors, liquid crystals, atomic vapors, doped glasses),  demonstrate
              photonic devices, perform linear and nonlinear  experiments with optical vortex
              traps.  (III) Establish industrial  contacts for technology transfer, identify
              novel nonlinear  applications including neural network schemes and
              self-organizing  structures, address fundamental issues such as optical
              turbulence,  chaos, and nonlinear scattering from single or clustered atoms.
