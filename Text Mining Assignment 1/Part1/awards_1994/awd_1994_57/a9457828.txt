Abstract    :
              9457828  Bruno       This research, supported by a National Science Foundation 
              Young Investigator Award, will focus on mathematical problems  related to
              microstructure and material properties.  In  particular, research will be
              conducted on homogenization of  composite materials and nonlinear
              homogenization for shape memory  polycrystals.  Existence problems for
              three-dimensional  magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium, resonant electromagnetic 
              scattering, and related issues in numerical analysis and  approximation theory
              will also be considered.         The National Science Foundation Young
              Investigator Award  recognizes outstanding young faculty.  This award
              recognizes the  recipient's strong potential for significant development as a 
              teacher and academic leader.
