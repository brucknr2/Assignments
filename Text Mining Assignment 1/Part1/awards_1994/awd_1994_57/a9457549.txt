Abstract    :
              9457549  Frost  This is an NSF Young Investigator Award.  It involves the  study
              of computer-based systems and methods for the  acquisition, management and
              visualization of geotechnical  engineering information. The research seeks to
              further  integrate the use of imaging and information technologies in  the
              analysis of geotechnical information, by taking  advantage of the fact that the
              analyzed data is in digital  form, and thus can be readily used in  computer
              visualization of geomechanics processes.    The focus is on the development of
              analytical techniques.  Specific aspects of the research involve digital
              imaging  processing and analysis techniques for acquiring  information,
              geographic information system hazard analysis,  and the visual analysis of
              geotechnical processes.  The  development of imaging and information system
              algorithms and  procedures for these specific tasks is fundamental to the 
              longer term goal of creating an integrated visual analysis  framework.    There
              are strong links between the research and the teaching  plan, which comprises
              an educational research component  involving visualization.  It involves the
              development of a  "Geotechnical Test Simulator" which will be evaluated and 
              compared with conventional teaching methods.  The combined  teaching and
              research plans seek to integrate the results of  interdisciplinary research and
              teaching developments into  education and practice.  ***
