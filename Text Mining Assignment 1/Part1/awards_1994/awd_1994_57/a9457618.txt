Abstract    :
              Humans  use their body  to communicate with each other.  Much  of  this
              communication is  mediated by vision, however vision is  not  currently   used 
              in human-to-machine  interfaces.  If  we  could  imitate    nature   and  
              obtain  good  human-to-machine   visual  communication we could  build
              convenient,  portable and  powerful  interfaces.   This   technology  would 
              contribute  immensely  to  industries  such as  entertainment,
              telecommunications,  portable  computing  and security.  Dr. Perona will study 
              techniques   for  tracking  and  recognition aimed  at building  visual 
              interfaces  between  humans and computers.  His research will concentrate  on 
              three  systems:  the face, the hands, and  the  limbs,  including  head  and 
              body  posture.  In  order  to access  the  information  conveyed  by  the limbs
              and the hand  it is first   necessary  to  locate  them  in  potentially 
              cluttered   images  and   then  to  reconstruct their configuration in space
              and  time. The face  has  to  be  detected,  its  3D  orientation computed,  
              its  features  located   and  its deformation measured.   Dr. Perona's 
              research  will  accordingly concentrate on scene segmentation  from  motion 
              flow  and  3D  motion, recursive estimation of the 3D  motion  of  kinematic   
              chains   with  partially   known   kinematics   from  monocular  and
              stereoscopic  sequences  of  perspective   images,  detection of complex
              objects (hands, face) in cluttered   scenes,  representation and estimation of
              nonrigid motions.
