Abstract    :
              9457376  Yennello  A research program in nuclear physics will be initiated. 
              This will center on the ultilization of beams of exotic  nuclei to investigate
              nuclear reaction mechanisms.  It will  be possible to explore separately both
              isospin equilibration  and the effects on nuclear properties of the Coulomb
              force.  ***
