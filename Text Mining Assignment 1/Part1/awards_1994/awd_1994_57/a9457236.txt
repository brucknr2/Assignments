Abstract    :
              9457236  Sah  Investigations to be conducted in this project will  contribute to
              the development of a knowledge base for  cartilage tissue engineering through
              integrative  experimental, theoretical, and computational studies.  The 
              principal investigator expects to characterize the spatial  variation of the
              biophysical properties of articular  cartilage and relate the macroscopic to
              the molecular  constituents.  The biophysical mechanisms of cartilage  repair
              and degeneration  are to be delineated by relating  biophysical perturbations
              to structural and functional  responses.
