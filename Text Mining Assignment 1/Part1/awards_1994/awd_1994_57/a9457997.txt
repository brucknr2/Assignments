Abstract    :
              9457997  Winey  This research explores the interdependence of structure and 
              properties in complex systems, particularly systems involving  copolymers. 
              Using a comprehensive approach involving synthesis,  structure and properties,
              this proposal addresses the fundamental  questions of sequence distribution and
              non-universality.  With the  inspiration of nature's remarkable protein
              engineering, it will  strive to develop the technological applications of
              copolymers and  their blends to their full capacity.  %%%  ***
