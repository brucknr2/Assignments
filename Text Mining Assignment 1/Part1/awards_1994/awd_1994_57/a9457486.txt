Abstract    :
              9457486  Mastrangelo  The research supported shall aid in the development of
              tools, processes and techniques for reliable micromechanical devices.  These
              include fabrication process synthesis programs and new transduction mechanisms,
              devices and techniques for microsensors.  In addition, the development of
              micromachined chemical reactors for biological analysis, such as DNA
              sequencing, and nanofabricated tools for intracellular studies will be pursued.
