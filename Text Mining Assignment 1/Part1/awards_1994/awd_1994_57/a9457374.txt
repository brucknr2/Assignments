Abstract    :
              This NSF Young Investigator Award from the Organic Dynamics Program   supports
              the work of Professor Kahr at Purdue University to understand   and control 
              crystal growth. Inorganic crystals with included organic   dyes called hour
              glass inclusions will be investigated to study their   applications for
              materials research, non linear optical devices, and   solid state lasers.
              Research into the factors affecting the rates of   crystal growth will be
              undertaken in order to control unique features of   crystals and to design
              special crystals from first principles.    With this NYI Award Professor Kahr
              will study the behavior of  molecular   compounds included in solid crystals
              made up from inorganic substances   such as sodium sulfate or Glauber's salt.
              These novel mixed crystals will   be studied to see if they can act as solid
              state lasers or if they   exhibit unique optical phenomena applicable to
              materials research. This   research will advance the understanding of the
              control of crystal growth   which is important to diverse areas such as drugs,
              materials, and   semiconductors.
