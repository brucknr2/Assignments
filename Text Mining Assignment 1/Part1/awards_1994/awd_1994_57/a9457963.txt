Abstract    :
              9457963  Singh    The Principal Investigator plan to develop the area of sub- 
              nanosecond laser ablation related to deposition of diamond-like-  carbon thin
              films.  The high power densities and the unique nature  of laser-solid-plasma
              interactions is expected to give rise to  smooth diamond-like-carbon films
              which possess increased diamond-  like character and improved adhesion with the
              substrate.  Detailed  simulation of the laser-target interactions, insitu
              analysis of the  laser generated plume and property-structure correlationships 
              experiments will be carried out as a part of this investigation.   My teaching
              plan is to develop multi=media instructional materials  for a proposed
              materials synthesis and processing course.    %%%    The Principal Investigator
