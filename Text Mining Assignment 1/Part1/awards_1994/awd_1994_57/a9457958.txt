Abstract    :
                                                                                       
              Technical  abstract:   It  is  proposed  to  investigate  the  quantum 
              interaction of a single-electron device with the local electromagnetic 
              environment.  It is also planned to carry out a detailed study of  the 
              even-odd  electron  number physics in mesoscopic superconductors.   An 
              additional   project   is  the  development   of   an   ultrasensitive 
              electrometer based on single-electron tunneling.    Non-technical  abstract:  
              It  is  now  technologically  feasible   to  fabricate  ultrasmall  materials
              systems that  exhibit  a  fascinating  variety of phenomena known as mesoscopic
              quantum physics.  Perhaps the  most  exciting recent advance is our ability to
              make devices in  which  the   flow  of  electrical  charge  can  be  controlled
               at  the  most  fundamental level possible: one electron at a time.  The
              objective  of  the  current  research program is the advancement  of 
              single-electron  device  physics  as  an impending technology and  the 
              utilization  of  single-electron  techniques to probe the physics of  condensed
               matter  systems on an atomic scale.
