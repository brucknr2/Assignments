Abstract    :
              To research the design of a natural language generator capable of  exploiting 
              previous  discourse in subsequent  explanations,  and  appropriately  using 
              discourse markers to  convey  relationships  among  discourse elements.  The
              methodology uses corpus  analysis  to  form  hypotheses  to  be  implemented 
              and  evaluated  in   a  computational discourse planner based on principled  AI
               planning  formalisms.
