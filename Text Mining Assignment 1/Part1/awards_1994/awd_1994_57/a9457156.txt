Abstract    :
              9457156  Mantell       The goal of this research is to develop and implement a 
              noncontact, nondestructive method for evaluating interlaminar  bonding during
              in-situ consolidation of composites.  An airborne  acousto-ultrasonic technique
              will be implemented in closed loop  control of tape laying.  In the early
              phases of this research, the  focus will be on developing a better
              understanding of airborne  ultrasonic waves for detecting defects in
              composites.  A  theoretical model relating airborne acousto-ultrasonic
              operating  parameters to the resulting stress wave will be developed and 
              experimentally validated.  The second phase of the research will  entail
              sensing and evaluating bond quality off line using the  proposed air contact
              NDE method.  Specimens of varying thickness  with an poorly bonded top most
              layer will be manufactured and  tested.  Nondestructive evaluation of bond
              strength will be  compared with mechanical tests of the bond strength.  In the
              final  phase, the proposed air contact NDE method will be integrated into  an
              existing tape laying apparatus.  Following statistical design of  experiment
              techniques, an empirical process model will be developed  and a closed loop
              control algorithm implemented.       This research is significant on several
              fronts.  In processing  of advanced materials via in-situ consolidation,
              adequate  interlaminar bonding is critical to part structural integrity.  
              Because cost of these materials is high, it is desirable to monitor  part
              quality during processing.  Defects identified during  processing can be
              reworked immediately as part of the process  control scheme; thereby improving
              yields and reducing scrap and  costs.  A noncontact method also offers
              portability to remote sites  and on line (during manufacture) sensing
              capabilities.  Moreover,  similar methodologies could be applied to other
              in-situ  consolidation and bonding processes.
