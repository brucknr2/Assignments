Abstract    :
                                                   Technical  abstract:  Atomic scale
              structures will be  fabricated  and  studied on metal and semiconducting
              surfaces.  The structures will  be  built  atom  by  atom using a liquid helium
              cooled, ultra-high  vacuum  scanning  tunneling  microscope (STM).  The  STM 
              chamber  will  house  surface  analytic tools, thin film epitaxi equipment, and
               a  1  Tesla  magnet.   The combined abilities of atomic manipulation, imaging,
               and  spectroscopy  will  allow  study  of  the  electronic  structure   and 
              transport  properties  of  nanometer scaled objects.   Potentials  for  device
              application will be evaluated.    Non-technical abstract:  Nanometer scale
              structures will be built  and  studied  using  a low temperature scanning
              tunneling microscope  (STM)  The  structures  will  be built by sliding
              individual  atoms  along  a  conducting   surface  using  the  tip  of  an 
              STM.   The  microscopic  structures will be studied under various conditions,
              such  as  in  the  presence  of  a flowing current or in a magnetic field.  
              Solid  state  phenomena  will be studied at the smallest possible length
              scales,  as  well as the potential for device applications.
