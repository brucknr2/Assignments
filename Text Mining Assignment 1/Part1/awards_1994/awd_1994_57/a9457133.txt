Abstract    :
              9457133  Baldick  Currently, optimal power flow and other software tools in use
              in  the electric power industry assume a centrally dispatched and  planned
              network.  However, with increased non-utility generation  and increased trades
              of electricity over larger distances, the  assumption of centralized dispatch
              and planning is less  reasonable.  I plan to incorporate models of
              organizational  structure, such as separated ownership, control, and planning 
              into optimal power flow, unit commitment, and transmission  planning
              formulations.  This work will build on my ongoing  research projects and
              consolidate them.  ***
