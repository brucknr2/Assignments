Abstract    :
              9457903  Robicheaux  This research involves the theoretical description of
              atomic and  molecular states near the ionization threshold.  Time dependent 
              techniques will be studied for insight into the electronic  dynamics.  The
              direct calculation of experimentally measured  parameters that include
              statistical errors will be undertaken for  correlated systems.  ***
