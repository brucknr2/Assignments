Abstract    :
              9457179  Renaud   Existing multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) 
              technologies do not generally account for system design and  manufacturing
              variances.  In this research robust design strategies  for optimization (i.e.,
              Taguchi based) will be embedded in MDO  algorithms currently being developed
              which make use of both  artificial neural networks and global sensitivities for
              system  approximation.  As part of this effort an investigation of the  utility
              of artificial neural networks for modeling design and  manufacturing
              uncertainties will be undertaken.  Based on current  investigations of
              artificial neural networks for design space  mapping, it is thought that
              artificial neural networks may provide  an ideal mechanism for modeling
              variance throughout a product's  life cycle design.     In order for the United
              States companies to remain competitive in  advanced product design and
              manufacture, new technologies to aid  designers in making decisions throughout
              the product design cycle  must be developed.  The design tools and
              methodologies to be  developed in this research will help ensure the
              advancement of  United States competitiveness in advanced product design and 
              manufacture.
