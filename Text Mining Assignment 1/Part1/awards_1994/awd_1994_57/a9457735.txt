Abstract    :
              9457735 Jin  The overall objective of this research project is to develop
              accurate and efficient computational methods for analysis of electromagnetic
              problems in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and high power microwaves.  The
              focus will be on the development of hybrid finite element methods capable of
              simulating large and complex objects.    To be more specific, a finite element
              method will be developed to characterize the interactions between the
              radio-frequency (RF) field,  generated by an MRI antenna, and the human body in
              an MRI environment.  A better understanding of such interactions can provide
              guidelines for designing MRI antennas that have a high signal-to-noise ratio
              (SNR) and good RF magnetic field (B1 field) homogeneity in the region of
              interest.  The method to be developed will be able to model the MRI antennas,
              the environment of the MRI system, and the anatomical and inhomogeneous
              dissimilar tissues.  Based on this method, we then plan to develop an inverse
              method for a systematic optimization of the design of MRI antennas. In
              addition, a hybrid finite element methods will be developed to characterize the
              interactions between high power microwaves and complex cavity situated in a
              large object such as an airplane.  A clear understanding of such interactions
              is instrumental in developing new electronic system capable of functioning
              normally in any high-intensity ambient (i) complex internal structures,  (ii)
              external environments, and (iii) coupling of energy form external environments
              to internal systems. ***
