Abstract    :
              9457217  Tyler  The tightly adherent biomolecules that are utilized in the 
              adhesion of microorganisms to surfaces are to be examined by  Time-of-Flight
              Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) in  order to determine surface
              interactions of the initial attachment  of microorganisms to surfaces.  Basic
              research/development on  spectra interpretation is to be an additional focus of
              this  project, and used as a means of opening this area of research to  this
              new surface analysis technology.  ***
