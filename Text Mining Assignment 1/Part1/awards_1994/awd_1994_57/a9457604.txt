Abstract    :
              9457604  Idriss    This project is a NSF Young Investigator Award.  The subject
              of  the research is concerned with the safety of bridges, in  particular steel
              bridges.  The research activity includes  modelling the safety of steel bridges
              which have undergone  various degrees of deterioration.  The use of
              nondestructive  evaluations and monitoring determine the condition of the
              bridge,  and full or large scale testing to verify the mathematical  models.
