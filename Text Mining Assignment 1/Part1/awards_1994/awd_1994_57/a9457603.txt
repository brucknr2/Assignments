Abstract    :
                    9457603  Ghosh  This NYI award is to provide linkage between fundamentals
              of  mechanics, materials science, design and manufacturing.  Novel  methods of
              computational mechanics using multiple scale analyses  for concurrent design
              and processing of advanced materials will be  employed.  Industrial interaction
              will be used to validate the  procedures.  ***
