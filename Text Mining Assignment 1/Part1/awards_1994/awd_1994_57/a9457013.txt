Abstract    :
              9457013  El-Halwagi    This is an NSF Young Investigator Award (NYI) for
              research which focuses on waste reduction though chemical process synthesis. 
              This approach provides a systematic framework to efficiently tackle pollution-
              prevention problems.  In order to address the problem of waste recovery through
              recycle/reuse units, the PI has introduced several new problems and developed
              tool for designing recycle/reuse systems.  These concepts include the synthesis
              of mass-exchange networks, "MENS", membrane-hybrid systems and heat-induced
              separation networks "HISENS".  A wide spectrum of separation technologies for
              waste management (e.g. adsorption, absorption, solvent extraction, ion
              exchange, reverse osmosis, pervaporation, condensation, crystallization and
              drying) can be tackled through these design tools.  Economic and environmental
              benefits can also accrue as a result of using these design tools.    The PI's
              teaching objective is to prepare a new generation of practicing engineers who
              are familiar with waste-reduction design tools and concepts.  The PI has been
              working on incorporation systematic tools for the optimal design of
              environmentally-acceptable plants into the curriculum.  In addition to teaching
              these concepts in the classroom, the PI has started to write a textbook on
              "Systematic Design Tools for Pollution Prevention".  The book contains various
              educational tools and industrial applications on the design and assessment of
              environmentally-acceptable chemical plants.  ***
