Abstract    :
              9457897  Bigelow  A research program in experimental atomic physics will be 
              initiated.  A novel trap will be developed that will be able to  store two
              species of atoms simultaneously.  This will allow the  study of the collisions
              of different ultra-cold atoms, in which  different processes will dominate as
              compared to same-atom  collisions.  ***
