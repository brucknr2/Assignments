Abstract    :
              9457206  Doumanidis       The research addresses the issue of simultaneous,
              real-time  regulation of part geometry and thermal field, in thermal rapid 
              prototyping, by redesigning the process arrangement and  implementing a scanned
              thermal actuation.  In thermal rapid  prototyping, both the material supply, by
              a wire feeder or spray,  and heat transfer, by a plasma or laser source, need
              to be  modulated during the process as successive layers of material are 
              deposited or removed from the part surface.  The layer profile  geometry and
              thermal distribution on the product surface will be  measured by a laser vision
              system, and an infrared camera  respectively, and used for feedback to the
              thermo-geometrical  controller.  This will adjust the material and heat source 
              intensity and guide their motion on dynamic trajectories to the  areas where
              their action is needed most, so as to obtain the  desired geometric tolerances,
              the material structure and  properties, and stress effects in the part.      
              The calibrated controller will be implemented experimentally  on several rapid
              prototyping techniques, i.e. laminated object  manufacturing, laser milling,
              fused material deposition and thermal  spray deposition.  The research will
              also be coupled to supportive  teaching activities, enriching the thermal
              manufacturing curriculum  at the university.  These include the establishment
              of a graduate  manufacturing automation seminar with guest lectures and
              industrial  sponsorship.  A series of motivating introductory courses will also
               be developed, with multidisciplinary manufacturing content and  hands-on
              prototyping projects, in the laboratory.
