Abstract    :
              9457909  Patterson  This is the initiation of a research program in experimental
               particle physics.  Techniques will be developed to make precision 
              measurements of tests of the current theory of particles (the  "Standard
              Model").  One such measurement will be of a rare decay  process of particular
              particles.  Another will be a search for  particle decays that violate certain
              basic symmetries.  ***
