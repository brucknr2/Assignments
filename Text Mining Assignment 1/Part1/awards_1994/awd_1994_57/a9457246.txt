Abstract    :
              9457246  Alvarez-Cohen  This is an award to support research through a National
              Science  Foundation Young Investigator Award to be performed by the  Principal
              Investigator who was nominated and selected through  procedures contained in
              NSF 93-148, Young Investigator Awards FY  1994 Program.  This investigator's
              research plan includes work  directed toward enhancing our understanding of
              microbial-mediated  cometabolic degradations, reactions carried out by
              microorganisms  without yielding significant benefits to them, necessitating an
               alternate substrate for their growth.  Her plan includes  simultaneous
              dual-labeling of compounds using stable isotopes and  radio-labeled compounds. 
                Results of this work are expected to be used in devising  mathematical models
              that can be used in engineering design of  bioreactors.   These models are
              expected to be used in  formulation and validation of mathematical models that
              can be  used in the engineering design of bioreactors for decontamination  of
              water.
