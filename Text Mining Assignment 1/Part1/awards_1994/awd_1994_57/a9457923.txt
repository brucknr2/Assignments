Abstract    :
              9457923  Shull  The primary objectives of this work are to relate polymer
              adhesion  to the molecular structure of the interface, and to quantify the 
              interfacial features which dominate many of the properties of  polymer/metal
              composite systems.  Well characterized polymers  synthesized by anionic
              polymerization will be used as model  systems.  %%%  ***
