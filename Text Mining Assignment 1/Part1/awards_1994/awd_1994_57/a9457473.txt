Abstract    :
               Visual programming is intuitively very appealing, because it allows  the
              programmer to express relationships among, or transformations to, data  simply
              by sketching them, pointing at them, or demonstrating them -- not by 
              translating them into sequences of commands, pointers, and abstract symbols. 
              This removal of many of the concepts traditionally required to program
              computers,  combined with continuous visual feedback, offers the promise of
              making   programming easier and more reliable.  Yet, there is a problem that
              has  caused the potential of visual programming to remain largely untapped. 
              Most visual programming languages (VPLs) to date are not  easily extended
              beyond small demonstration programs to adequately handle  realistic programming
              without re-introducing the very concepts they have  tried to remove.  This
              problem is called the scaling-up problem.  The   objective of this research is
              to improve the scalability of VPLs.   The focus is in three directions:  (1)
              developing ways to increase  expressive power and code reuse that also maintain
              the qualities of   simplicity and concreteness; (2) developing a concrete
              approach to   implicit polymorphic types suitable for VPLs; and (3) extending
              the   applicability of VPLs.  Research results from investigating these  three
              directions are prototyped in the research system Forms/3, a  lazy declarative
              visual language.
