Abstract    :
                      9457573  Bhattacharya  This National Young Investigator award is to
              develop and apply  mechanics techniques to understand the behavior of novel
              modern  materials.  The purpose is to develop more quantitative models of 
              various fundamental phenomena that are presently viewed in  qualitative ways. 
              Shape memory materials will be studies as well  as martensitic and displacive
              phase transformations.  ***
