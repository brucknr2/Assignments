Abstract    :
              9457518  Danzig       This project deals with packet networks for computer 
              communications.  A major portion of the project deals with control  algorithms,
              in the context of multimedia traffic,  reserved-bandwidth channels, and
              high-bandwidth and  asymmetric-bandwidth paths. Simulation and emulation are
              the tools  utilized for performance evaluation, and the work contributes to as 
              well as utilizes these tools.  For the admission control algorithm  to meet its
              delay bounds and maintain high link utilizations, must  it know the traffic
              model a priori or can it adapt to observed  traffic behavior? Is "predictive
              service" only usable with  high-levels of multiplexing? What innovations are
              required for  efficiently software implementation?  Hybrid-simulations are
              under  development to study high-bandwidth wide area networks.  The tools  are
              driven by artificial workload models of TCP/IP traffic.  An  emulator,
              consisting of 10-30 workstations configurable into  arbitrary  topologies,
              driven by the workload models, has been  built and will be used to evaluate
              reliable multicast and traffic  control and load sensitive routing algorithms.
