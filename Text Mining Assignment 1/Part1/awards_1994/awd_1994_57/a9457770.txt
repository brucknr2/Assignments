Abstract    :
               The goal of this research is to make parallel  computing simple and efficient
              on general-purpose, commodity processors and  networks.  Recent work has
              focused on algorithms for the  efficient implementation of software distributed
              shared memory (DSM) on  low-cost, high-performance workstation clusters.  This
              work has shown that  software DSM can achieve performance close to a hardware
              implementation of  shared memory on a variety of scientific applications that
              synchronize with  moderate frequency.  The objective is to improve this work in
              two ways;  (1) to achieve the efficient execution of applications that
              synchronize with  greater frequency and, (2) to support languages ordinarily
              used to solve  symbolic problems.  Specifically, the following approaches are
              evaluated:  (a) run-time support for  programming high-level synchronization
              operations, such as task queues, that  reduces the amount of communication by
              the DSM system, (b) compiler support to  reduce the amount and/or hide the
              latency of communication by the DSM system,  and (c) garbage collection
              algorithms integrated with the DSM system to enable  the efficient execution of
              advanced programming languages.
