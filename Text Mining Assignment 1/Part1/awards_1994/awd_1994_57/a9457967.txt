Abstract    :
              9457967  Dawson       In this project, the primary focus will be the design and 
              implementation of high precision actuators for manufacturing  applications. 
              Specifically, advanced nonlinear position tracking  controllers will be
              developed for several types of electric motors  for the actuation of mechanical
              loads.  These nonlinear controllers  are designed at the voltage input of the
              motor; therefore, the  electrical dynamics of the motor as well as the
              mechanical dynamics  of the load are both accounted for in the low level
              control  synthesis.  The nonlinear control techniques to be considered can  be
              divided into two general categories: (1) controllers which  require full state
              feedback, for example, rotor position, rotor  velocity, and per phase currents,
              and are capable of compensating  for system uncertainty, for example,
              parametric uncertainty and/or  system disturbances, and (2) controllers which
              require only partial  state feedback, for example, rotor position only, but
              rely on  perfect knowledge of the entire electromechanical dynamics.       The
              research is expected to lead to advancements in  high-performance servo drives
              using electrical actuators.  Machines  used in manufacturing applications are
              expected to benefit from  this research.
