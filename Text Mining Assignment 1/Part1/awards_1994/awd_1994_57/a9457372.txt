Abstract    :
              9457372  Chmielewski  With this National Science Foundation Young Investigator
              (NYI)  award, the Synthetic Organic Program of the Chemistry Division  is
              supporting the research and teaching activities of Dr. Jean  A. Chmielewski of
              the Department of Chemistry at Purdue  University.  The focus of Professor
              Chmielewski's research is  to design a new approach to enzyme inhibition which
              is based on  the dissociation of enzyme subunits.  The dimeric enzyme HIV-1 
              protease has been targeted as a test case to assess the  inhibition strategy. 
              The focus of Dr. Chmielewski's teaching  activities will be the redesigning of
              the departmental  laboratory curriculum in organic chemistry.
