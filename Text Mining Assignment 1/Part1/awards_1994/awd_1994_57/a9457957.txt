Abstract    :
                9457957  Lewis    Principal Investigator would pursue new areas of research
              and  instrumentation which are emerging in materials science and  engineering.
              In particular, the proposed research and educational  plan would focus on
              developing a fundamental understanding of  cross-disciplinary interactions in
              polymer-stabilized nanosized  ceramic systems.  Novel materials with unusual
              properties are  expected at the size and scale of nanosized particles, which
              are  greatly different or improved over conventional bulk ceramics.   Efforts
              will be directed to design organic processing aids their  effects on
              microstructural development.  The specific research  objectives are to study
              the role of "free" and adsorbed polymeric  species on interparticle forces,
              suspension stability and rheology,  and the influence of such properties on the
              resulting  microstructures of ceramic forms and coatings derived from these 
              systems.  The educational component of the proposed plan would  focus mainly on
              two activities:  new course and text development.   The Principal Investigator
              plan to develop a new graduate level  course entitled "Sol-Gel and Nanosized
              Particulate Ceramic  Processing Science" to be taught in the Spring, 1995. 
              These course  notes and those developed for a senior level course "Ceramics 
              Processing and Microstructural Development" which the Principal  Investigator
              currently teach will serve as a basis for preparing a  much needed text book --
              Colloidal Processing of Advanced Ceramics.    %%%    The specific research
              objectives are to study the role of 'free'  and adsorbed polymeric species on
              interparticle forces, suspension  stability and rheology and the influence of
              such properties on the  resulting microstructure of ceramic forms and coating
              derived from  these systems.  The Principal Investigator also plan to develop a
               new graduate level course and may prepare a text book in the field  in the
              near future.  ***
