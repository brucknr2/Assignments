Abstract    :
              This NSF Young Investigator award supports the research and teaching interests
              of Ludwig C. Nitsche of the University of Chicago.  The nature of the
              recipient's teaching plan involves "one day at a time, one student at a time"
              in fundamental principles, computational opportunities, technological
              innovation, and undergraduate research projects.  His research includes
              antipolarization dialysis for fractionating complex mixtures and acoustic
              diffusion gates for microporous membranes.
