Abstract    :
                This project covers theoretical and implementation work on both  deductive
              databases and on a declarative object-oriented database  language.  In the area
              of deductive databases, foundational work on  the semantics and optimization of
              rules with recursive aggregation  and negation is being pursed.  Efficient
              techniques for incremental  computation of aggregation functions are being
              developed.   Syntactically checkable stratification conditions that are more 
              general than past proposal are also being investigated.  In the  area of
              declarative object-oriented databases, a language called  Noodle has been
              designed, and is being implemented as part of the  SWORD/Oda database systems. 
              Once implemented, the system will be  tested on realistic applications.
