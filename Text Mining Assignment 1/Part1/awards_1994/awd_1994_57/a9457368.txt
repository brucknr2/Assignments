Abstract    :
              This NSF Young Investigator award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and
              Organometallic  Chemistry Program supports research on metal silicides by Dr.
              Ziling B. Xue of the Chemistry  Department, University of Tennessee at
              Knoxville.  Two areas are emphasized:  development  of synthetic routes to
              metal silicides and polysilanes, and investigation of the mechanism of solid 
              state organometallic reactions.   On the first topic, early transition metal
              silyl complexes which  do not contain cyclopentadiene or analogous ligands will
              be prepared; very few compounds of  this type are known.  These compounds will
              be used to develop a new route to metal silicides  and polysilanes, which are
              useful for electronic devices.  Tetrahydrosilane will also be used to  form
              metal silicides under chemical vapor deposition conditions.  In the second
              area, solid-gas  reactions of alkyl compounds with phosphines will be studied. 
              Research will focus on the  factors affecting retention of solid state
              structure during reaction.  Instrumentation from Oak  Ridge National Laboratory
              will be used for some of the structural determinations.  This work  has
              implications for synthesis of heterogeneous catalysts.
