Abstract    :
              9457750  Vakakis  This is a National Science Foundation Young Investigator
              Award.  The main research efforts by the PI include dynamics and control  of
              periodic engineering systems; response of layered composite  media and system
              identification of mechanical structures using  analytical and numerical
              techniques. His teaching activities  involve a design of laboratory exercises
              on the dynamics of  physical systems, development of two new graduate courses
              in the  area of nonlinear dynamics and structural acoustics, and 
              dynamics/control integration in undergraduate education.  ***
