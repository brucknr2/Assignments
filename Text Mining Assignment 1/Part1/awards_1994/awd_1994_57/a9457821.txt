Abstract    :
              9457821      WEITSMAN             Jonathan    TITLE:   Mathematical Sciences : 
              NSF Young Investigator         Technical Narrative:              This research,
              supported by a National Science  Foundation Young Investigator award, will be
              concerned with  results and conjectures arising in mathematical physics and the
               geometry of moduli spaces associated to Riemann surfaces. It is  intended to
              pursue specific applications of several techniques  arising in integrable
              nonlinear differential equations, three  dimensional topological structures and
              the cohomology ring of the  moduli space of curves. The research is potentially
              of an  interdisciplinary nature with anticipated applications to  mathematical
              physics.              The National Science Foundation Young investigator  award
              recognizes outstanding young faculty. This award recognizes  the recipient's
              strong potential for continued professional  growth as a research mathematician
              and for significant  development as a teacher and academic leader.  ***
