Abstract    :
              Professor Beckerle of the Chemistry Department of Clemson University is  
              supported by an NSF Young Investigator Award from the Experimental   Physical
              Chemistry Program to investigate the rates and mechanisms by   which the
              vibrational energy of molecules adsorbed on metal surfaces is   redistributed. 
               These studies will be carried out in real time using   ultrafast laser
              spectroscopy.  In this research, femtosecond   time-resolved infrared spectral
              hole-burning  will be employed in a   comparative study of the rates and
              mechanisms of vibrational energy   transfer for adsorbates on the surfaces of
              metal structures ranging in   size from bulk sigle crystals to ultrathin metal
              films to nanometer size   metal particles.    Much of contemporary surface
              science is devoted to the understanding of   heterogeneous catalysis, and the
              growth and processing of advanced   materials. An important aspect of such
              studies is the effective   comparison of adsorbates on metal surfaces of widely
              ranging sizes and/or   geometry.  The research undertaken in this project will
              serve to provide   important insight into the way in which vibrational energy
              of adsorbed   molecules redistributes itself across a metal surface.
