Abstract    :
              9457981  Long       This research addresses the interaction between humans, 
              machines, and electronic media by exploring the potential of Force-  Reflecting
              Haptic-Environment for Computer-Aided Design,  Telerobotics, and Virtual
              Reality applications.  The research draws  upon an indepth understanding of
              haptic recognition in humans,  force-reflection and haptic-simulation schemes,
              and screw-systems  theory.       The force-reflecting haptic-environment is
              comprise of  adjustable left/right haptic hand-imprints, each mounted on 
              separate six degree-of-freedom in-parallel force-reflecting plat-  forms.  the
              hand-imprints simulate various haptically important  properties such as
              texture, hardness, and thermal conductivity.   The six degree-of-freedom
              in-parallel force-reflecting platforms,  which engage the upper limbs,
              constrain hand motion along  prescribed geometric contours.  The entire system
              is compact and  light enough to place in a brief case.       This novel
              force-reflecting haptic-environment is intended for  rapid development of
              computer-designed products, manipulation of  remote physical objects
              (telerobotics and robotics-surgery), and  interaction with computer-generated
              non-physical objects (virtual  reality).
