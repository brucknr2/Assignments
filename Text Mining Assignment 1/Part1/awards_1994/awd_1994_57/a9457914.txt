Abstract    :
              9457914  Barker  A research program will be initiated in elementary particle 
              physics.  This will include a search for several possible  reactions in which a
              basic symmetry will not be conserved.  The  discovery of such reactions would
              be an important step in  understanding the reason for this non-conservation.
