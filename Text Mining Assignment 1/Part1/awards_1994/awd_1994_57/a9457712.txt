Abstract    :
              In this NSF Young Investigator Award in the Physical Chemistry Program of   the
              Chemistry Division, James R. Heath will focus on understanding and  
              controlling the chemistry and physics of size and shape on a   nanometer-length
              scale, with emphasis on Group IV and III-V quantum   crystals.  The physics of
              size and shape is probed through a variety of   single-particle and time- and
              frequency-resolved spectroscopies.  Silicon   and germanium quantum dots,
              atomically straight Ge quantum wires, and   atomically flat Ge quantum wells
              have all been synthesized and are   candidates for study.  Ordered, complex
              structures over three dimensions   will be prepared by coupling wires, dots,
              and platelets together.    Self-assembly techniques are also investigated. 
              Biological systems are   also being examined as templates on which to fabricate
              tiny   superconducting metal wires.  %%%  The synthetic methods developed and
              investigated under this award offer   the promise for substantially better size
              resolution than   state-of-the-art lithographic techniques.  The challenge in
              this program   is to learn how to assemble nanometer-size structures over two
              dimensions   with regularity.  Such nano-scale structures are important in the 
               fabrication of miniaturized electronic devices which could help form the  
              microchips for future applications.
