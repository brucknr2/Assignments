Abstract    :
              Under this National Science Foundation Young Investigator Award, Thomas   J.
              Curtiss will explore the chemical dynamics of gas/surface collisions.    High
              purity, high intensity neutral radical beams (for example, OH or CFx   where x
              is 1, 2, or 3) are generated using electric field focussing   methods.  Charge
              transfer interaction mechanisms are investigated using   state-selective laser
              detection methods to probe vibrational state   populations of inelastically and
              reactively scattered products.  %%%  The chemistry of gas phase atoms and
              radicals with semiconductor and   metal surfaces is central to modern
              processing methods of thin films,   namely plasma activated etching and plasma
              activated chemical vapor   deposition.  This is particularly true in the
              microelectronics and   coatings industries.  To date, optimization of thin film
              processing   methods has been done empirically, by adjusting feedgas
              composition,   pressure and temperature.  This study is an attempt to study the
              surface   chemistry more systematically.
