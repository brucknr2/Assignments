Abstract    :
              9457950  Balsara  The objective of this project is to understand molecular 
              organization in microstructured polymer mixtures under quiescent  conditions
              and under the influence of external fields.  This will  enable the use and
              processing of existing materials more  effectively, and lead to the fabrication
              of new polymer-based  materials such as photonic bandgaps.  This work is
              concerned with  the synthesis and characterization of such materials and the 
              quantification of thermodynamic interactions that lead to  microstructure
              formation.  %%%  ***
