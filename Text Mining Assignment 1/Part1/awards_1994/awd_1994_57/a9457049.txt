Abstract    :
              This National Science Foundation Young Investigator project is in the   general
              area of surface chemistry, with a specific focus on the   characterization of
              semiconductor surfaces.  During the five-year tenure   of this award, Professor
              Maboudian and her students will carry out   fundamental studies on  the
              interaction of hydrogen and hydrocarbons with   indium-antimony surfaces, which
              serve as useful models for gallium   arsenide semiconductors.  This chemistry
              will be explored using a wide   range of surface sensitive techniques, such as
              x-ray photoelectron   spectroscopy, low energy electron diffraction, Auger, and
              high resolution   electron energy loss spectrometry. The use of self-assembled
              monolayers   to provide unreactive, defect free semiconductor surfaces will
              also be   explored during the course of this research project.    This project,
              in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program of the   Chemistry Division,
              should yield important insights into the structure of   semiconductor materials
              that are of great importance in the electronics   industry.  Additionally, this
              award will enable Professor Maboudian to   further her overall professional
              development as a researcher and educator   at the University of California at
              Berkeley.
