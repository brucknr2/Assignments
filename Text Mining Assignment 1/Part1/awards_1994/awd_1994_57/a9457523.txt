Abstract    :
                This is the first year base funding of a five-year National Science 
              Foundation Young Investigator Award.  The overall goal of this  research is to
              establish a science base for automated assembly by  analyzing its basic
              components.  The research involves development  of algorithms and interactive
              systems that analyze the low-level  geometry of assembly lines and their
              components, such as part  feeders, sorters, and fixtures.  An underlying theme
              is the use of  simple sensors and actuators such as light beams and
              parallel-jaw  grippers.  Although the hardware bears a close resemblance to 
              existing "hard'' automation systems, this research introduces  computational
              methods to rapidly configure and reliably control  this hardware.  At a higher
              level, modular components such as  flexible feeders and conveyor belts are
              interactively configured to  facilitate the design and evaluation of assembly
              lines prior to  installation.  The research addresses basic theoretical
              questions  such as the complexity and completeness of algorithms and involves 
              several companies in efforts to transfer basic results into  industrial
              practice.
