Abstract    :
              The research exploits the advantages of using synthetic aperture  radar (SAR) to
              detect, analyze, and quantify environmental changes.   The first research
              thrust focuses on improving SAR image formation  with a phased array airborne
              or spaceborne radar.  Efficient SAR  image formation techniques are being
              developed by appropriately  designing the transmitted waveforms of the phased
              array radar. The  trade-offs between nonparametric and parametric techniques
              are  being studied and understood.  The second research thrust focuses  on the
              SAR image understanding and ground truth evaluation.   Statistical clustering
              algorithms and various feature extraction  schemes that adequately incorporate
              electromagnetic phenomenology  are being developed and evaluated.  The third
              research thrust  focuses on the detection, analysis, and quantification of 
              environmental changes through repeated SAR imaging of critical  regions
              including the environmentally fragile Florida wetlands.   Change detection
              techniques are being developed to quantify and  document subtle environmental
              changes from these images.
