Abstract    :
              9457926 DenBaars  This research program is directed toward  understanding and
              developing novel metallo-organic chemical vapor  deposition schemes for the
              synthesis of III V nitride  serniconductor films.  The growth techniques of
              atomic layer  epitaxy and flow modulated epitaxy by metallo-organic chemical 
              vapor deposition (MOCVD) will be used to fabricate (aluminum,  gallium, indium)
              nitride heterostructure materials and devices.   These novel approaches of
              MOCVD growth are proposed in order to  lower the growth temperature and
              increase the quality of the films.   Growth on a variety of substrates such as:
              sapphire, silicon  carbide, zinc and magnesium oxides, and the use of
              alternative  precursors, such as tertiary-butylamine, will be investigated to 
              improve the optical and electrical properties of the nitride films.    %%% This
              research project involves the fabrication of newly  emerging nitride
              semiconductor materials and devices.  This  material system has enormous
              commercial relevance since it is one  of the most promising materials for
              optoelectronic devices  operating in the ultraviolet to blue wavelengths.  A
              laser diode  fabricated with these materials will vastly improve the optical 
              storage density for CD ROMs and could conceivably enable full  color projection
              displays.  An important feature of the program is  the training of graduate and
              undergraduate students in a  fundamentally and technologically significant area
              of materials and  processing research.  This research will contribute to
              improving  the general perform ance and to the realization of advanced  devices
              and integrated circuits used in computing, information  processing, and tele
              communica tions.  ***
