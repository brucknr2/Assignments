Abstract    :
              9457168  Wilhelm   The research addresses the design, manufacture, and metrology
              of sculptured surfaces.  Bezier splines, introduction of the coordinate
              measuring machine, and advances in design tools and maintaining systems have
              all spurred the use of surface descriptions in design and manufacturing.  Data
              from many industries suggests that engineering practice for surface design and
              manufacture is inefficient and far from robust.   To address these problems,
              the research program is focused on specification and control of form
              variations, high speed computation of surfaces to be machined, and
              opportunistic metrology procedures that use process and design knowledge for
              improved speed and accuracy.  This research will be incorporated into the
              principal investigator's teaching activities in mechanics, precision
              engineering, computer-aided design, and computational metrology.
