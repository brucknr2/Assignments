Abstract    :
              9457883  Blucher  This research program will study the properties of  elementary
              particles.  One key question to be investigated  is the mass and other
              properties of the "top quark".  Another topic will be the nature and origin of
              the violation  of a particular symmetry in one form of particle decay.  ***
