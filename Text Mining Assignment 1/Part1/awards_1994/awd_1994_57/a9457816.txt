Abstract    :
                Lewis       This is a National Science Foundation Young Investigator  grant. 
              Under its auspices, the investigator studies mechanisms  that give rise to
              spatial patterns of self-organization in  biological populations.  These
              include territories, herds and  swarms, and also spatial invasion/extinction
              processes.  Models  are expressed as nonlinear partial differential equations. 
              Analysis entails methods from bifurcation theory, singular and  regular
              perturbation theory, and computation.       This project focuses on three main
              environmental  applications: (1) the process of swarm formation in insects such
               as locusts, (2) the movement, spread and fate of genetically  engineered
              microbes applied in agricultural systems, and (3) the  process of territorial
              pattern formation in animals such as  wolves and badgers.  An understanding of
              these processes of  population aggregation, invasion and extinction, and
              territorial  pattern formation is key in evaluating the ecological impact that 
              a population has in the environment.  Such processes depend not  only on
              individual movements but also on complex spatial  behavioral interactions
              between individuals.  While developing  new biological models, this research
              employs a blend of applied  mathematical analysis and large-scale numerical
              computation to  analyse them.  The models are evaluated by their ability to 
              predict and explain data observed in the field.
