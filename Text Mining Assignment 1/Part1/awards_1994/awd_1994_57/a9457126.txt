Abstract    :
              9320041  Venkatasubramanian  The proposed research is in the area of dynamic
              theory underlying  the security analysis of large interconnected electric power
               systems.  Among the expected contributions of the proposed  research are the
              resolution of certain modeling issues which  arise near singular surfaces, and
              a practical procedure for  finding homoclinic orbits.  Another objective is the
              development  of a useful theory to deal with the common problem of changes in 
              system dimension as various devices  reach hard limits, or in the  case of
              structural changes.  ***
