Abstract    :
              Scalable shared-memory machines are a promising way of attaining  large-scale
              multiprocessing without surrendering much  programmability.  Achieving high
              performance from these machines,  however, is challenging because many complex
              architecture and  architecture-software implementation issues that have been
              only  partially studied considerably impact the performance of the  machines. 
              The objective of this research is to contribute in three  areas to help make
              shared-memory multiprocessors the preferred  source of computing power.  The
              three thrusts of this project are  to:  study the optimal division of
              responsibilities among the  hardware, compiler, and operating system to
              maintain cache  coherence in scalable share-memory multiprocessors; design 
              algorithms and hardware to effectively support multiprogramming of  parallel
              programs in scalable shared-memory multiprocessors; and  optimize the
              management of memory hierarchies and the interaction  of the operating system
              with the architecture.
