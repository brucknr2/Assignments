Abstract    :
                    ABSTRACT  CTS-9457111  MIT  P.I.:  Gregory Rutledge      At the heart of
              this research initiative lies the fundamental goal of understanding and
              engineering polymer properties from a knowledge of first principles of
              constituent chemical structure.  The need for such capability is manifested in
              many practical industrial problems related to the design of high performance
              polymers, the control of properties through nanoscale manipulation of chemical
              structure and morphology during processing, and current re-engineering of
              processes to produce better products from the same raw materials at reduced
              cost and with less waste.  The groundwork for this plan has been laid in the
              development of statistical thermodynamics for complex chemical systems and the
              computer-aided methods therein, and in the progress made in such techniques as
              X-ray diffraction, solid state NMR, and scanning probe microscopy to determine
              the accuracy with which engineering design principles may be reliably employed
              to develop new technologies and new materials.
