Abstract    :
                The primary focus of this research is the role of randomness  in  computation.
               Randomization has proved extremely useful in almost  all areas  of computer
              science, such as Monte Carlo simulations,  cryptography, distributed 
              computing, and network constructions.  These uses of randomness seem wonderful,
               until one realizes that  computers don't have truly random bits available to 
              them.    Most computers get their random bits by using pseudo-random 
              generators.  Usually, these pseudo-random generators work well in  practice. 
              Nevertheless, it is not at all unusual to find  instances where they don't.  It
               is therefore important to find  generators that are provably good, if such 
              generators exist.  Can  we always remove the randomness from an efficient 
              randomized  algorithm, and be left with an efficient deterministic algorithm 
              that produces the correct answer?  This is the general problem,  which has 
              different theoretical formulations, depending on the  notion of efficiency
              used.  Since polynomial time is the most  common measure of efficiency, the
              most common  theoretical  formulation is as follows:  does randomized
              polynomial time   (BPP) equal deterministic polynomial time (P)? 
              Unfortunately,   the only  direct progress on  the BPP vs. P question has
              relied on unproven  assumptions.     This work focuses on  two more specific
              questions.  First, can BPP be simulated using a general weak  random source 
              that outputs n bits with bounded entropy?  Second, does  RSPACE(S) = DSPACE(S)
              or, more realistically with five years, can  randomized  SPACE(S) algorithms
              that use more that poly(S) random  bits be simulated  deterministically in
              SPACE(S)?
