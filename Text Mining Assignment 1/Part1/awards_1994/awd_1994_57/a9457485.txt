Abstract    :
              9457485  Khammash  The research plan involves the creation and development of
              new  analytical and computational tools for the analysis and synthesis  of
              control systems in the presence of modeling uncertainty.   Another goal is to
              develop new robustness tools suitable for  handling more refined models of
              uncertainty and disparate  performance objectives.  The research will address
              the robustness  issues specific to particular application areas such as power 
              systems and compressor control systems.  The design of power  systems
              stabilizers, high voltage direct current modulation, and  static VAR
              compensators will be investigated.  ***
