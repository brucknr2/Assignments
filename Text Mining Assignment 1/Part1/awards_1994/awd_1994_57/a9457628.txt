Abstract    :
                Current  "engineering models of human performance" can  predict    the 
              processes experts use to accomplish tasks with a  computer    system and the
              time it takes to complete these tasks.  In  this    project  the models are
              extended to predict the problem-solving    behavior  exhibited  by  novice 
              computer  users,  learning  in    realistic  situations, and their commission 
              and  detection  of    errors.   As  is  the case with the previous models  of 
              expert    users, these new models can be used by computer developers  who   
              understand  the  predictive power of these improved  models  of    behavior to
              evaluate alternative interface approaches early  in    the  specification
              stages of their design, even before  running    systems or prototypes are
              available.
