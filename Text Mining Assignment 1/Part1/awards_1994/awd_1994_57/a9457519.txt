Abstract    :
              9457519  Kim    This project is aimed at designing, evaluating, and implementing
              a high-speed multimedia network based on the ATM technology and other
              alternatives.  Critical research issues include modular high-performance switch
              architecture, user-access and congestion control of multimedia traffic, and
              performance evaluation of a resulting network architecture with multiple-hop
              tandem nodes.    The proposed multicast ATM switch differs significantly from
              currently existing switches in terms of switch performance and hardware
              complexity.  The main characteristics of the switch architecture include: 
              shared-memory queue, distributed control, multicast capability, and low
              hardware cost.  Research will include implementing and extensively testing
              multiple 16x16 switches using real user data and evaluating performance of a
              multiple-hop ATM network using a recursive queueing model and simulation tools.
               Research will also include the investigation of the impact of heterogeneous
              and unbalanced multimedia traffic on the performance of multiple-hop  ATM
              networks.  The principal investigator (PI) will use a network testbed
              consisting of the proposed switches to evaluate various traffic control
              algorithms using real network traffic.  Success results from these experiments
              will improve analytical techniques using queueing models and validate the
              accuracy of traffic and network models.
