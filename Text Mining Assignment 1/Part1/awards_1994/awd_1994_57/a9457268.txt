Abstract    :
              9457268  Glaser    The research plan focuses on application of nondestructive 
              evaluation techniques to geotechnical engineering, combining  elements of
              electrical and mechanical engineering with the rich  heritage of geotechnical
              engineering.  The plan attacks on two  sales.  1. Diagnostic acoustic emission
              analysis of rock failure  mechanism for real-time monitoring.  2.  Application
              of recursive  system identification to soils excited by earthquake strong 
              motion for anlaysis of nonlinear behavior and damping.  ***
