Abstract    :
              9457148  Blumenthal  All optical photonic switch networks shall be studied, by
              developing and experimentally implementing new bufferlens all-optical routing
              techniques.  These techniques will be applied to novel multiwavelength photonic
              switch architectures.  Physical limitations to the size and scale of multihop
              multiwavelength networks will be experimentally investigated.  ***
