              Communication    The award will support two projects.  The first project
              integrates and  extends results from algebra, system theory, symbolic dynamics,
              and  coding theory to develop a structural framework for the analysis and 
              synthesis of nonlinear trellis codes.  Trellis codes, introduced by  Ungerboeck
              in 1982, are used in essentially all modern voice-band  modems; the recent V.34
              ITU modem standard specifies three types of  trellis codes that achieve
              communication rates exceeding 28800 bits  per second over ordinary telephone
              lines.  Despite the continued  interest in their construction, no comprehensive
              theory of trellis  codes has emerged.  The trellis codes specified in current
              and  proposed standards, for example, were designed largely via ad hoc 
              pencil-and-paper heuristics and computer search.  These methods have  reached
              their complexity limit, and future codes, with 256 states or  more, must be
              found by other means.  The aim of this project is to use  systems over groups
              to describe the symmetries inherent in good codes,  thereby facilitating the
              analysis of existing codes and the  construction of new ones.    The second
              research project will develop results in multiple access  communication.  There
              has been a recent explosion of interest in  wireless voice, video, and data
              communication over newly allocated  radio bands.  The multiple access
              communication environment in these  bands is characterized by fading,
              multipath, and non-Gaussian noise.  Intuit ion and rules of thumb for
              point-to-point communication over  Gaussian channels is often misleading when
              applied to this new  environment.  The goal of the project is to develop a new
              intuition  appropriate to radio.  This will require both a deeper theoretical 
              understanding of the fundamental performance limits of the channel and  also an
              understanding of how information-theoretic results can be  translated into
              practical implementations.  Specific subproblems  include optimal detection,
              adaptive antenna algorithms, and multiple  access coding techniques, especially
              as applied to communication at  rates 1 Mb/sec or more.
