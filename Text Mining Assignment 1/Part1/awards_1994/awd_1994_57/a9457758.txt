Abstract    :
              9457758  Aydil  Chemically reactive gas plasma, used in microelectronics 
              processing, will be studied.  The objective of this research  is to understand
              how the process conditions dictate the  properties of the plasmas, the
              transport phenomena and gas  phase and surface kinetics, which in turn affect
              the  properties of the materials processed.  The research is  organized along
              two lines:  developing and improving new  experimental  plasma and surface
              diagnostic techniques that  give fundamental information on the surface and gas
              phase  chemistry, and using these techniques to study and  manipulate
              processing conditions and engineering designs in  order to produce materials
              with desired properties in  applications such as plasma-enhanced chemical vapor
               deposition.  ***
