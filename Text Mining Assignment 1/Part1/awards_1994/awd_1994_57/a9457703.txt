Abstract    :
              9457703  Griffin  Stanford University  Two major projects will be pursued under
              this NSF Young Investigator Award: (1) The detailed analysis of oxidosqualene
              cyclase (OSC) enzymes and (2) The elaboration of antibacterial agents which
              exhibit catalytic activity towards their cellular targets (i.e., catalytic
              antibiotics). A long-term goal in the first project will be to gain a detailed
              mechanistic and structural understanding of OSC enzymes, which catalyze the
              transformation of oxidosqualene to sterols and related triterpenoids.
              Inhibitors of OSCs will be prepared that will include inhibitors with promising
              anti-fungal activity. In the second project, the hypothesis that antibacterial
              agents which act catalytically against their targets will be more potent than
              those which act stoichiometrically will be tested. In this study, bacitracin,
              which sequesters intermediates in cell wall biosynthesis containing bactoprenyl
              pyrophosphate will be investigated.    This grant from the Organic Dynamics
              Program supports the research of Professor John H. Griffin at Stanford
              University. The mechanism by which an enzyme affects the cyclization of a
              molecule into steroids will be pursued and related to the structure of enzyme.
              From a knowledge of the structure of the enzyme, inhibitors of this enzyme will
              be prepared that include those with anti-fungal activity. In another project,
              the mechanism of antibacterial action will be investigated from a molecular
              perspective. A hypothesis will be tested to determine if antibacterial agents
              that operate in a catalytic manner are more potent than those that do not.
