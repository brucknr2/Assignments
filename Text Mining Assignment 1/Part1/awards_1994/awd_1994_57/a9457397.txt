Abstract    :
              There are three major architectural models used in high-performance 
              signal/image processing: (1) VLSI- signal processing - high-  throughput VLSI
              architectures for low-cost application-specific  implementations used in
              applications such as communication systems,  speech, video/HDTV, and radar; (2)
              parallel signal processing on  massively parallel computers - parallel
              algorithms for complex  signal/imaging systems used in computer vision, medical
              imaging,  and the processing of vast amounts of data in deep space 
              exploration; (3) distributed signal processing on high-speed  networks - used
              in applications such as document image processing,  multimedia, automatic
              signal processing in manufacturing, and  medical signal/image processing.   
              This research will focus on the development of efficient algorithms  and
              architectures for each architectural model, and in comparative  studies of the
              advantages and disadvantages of these different  computing schemes.  The goal
              is to investigate which signal/image  processing problems can be carried out
              optimally under different  computing and communication schemes.
