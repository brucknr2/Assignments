Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9457097  Daniel Schwartz      The general objective of this effort
              is the correlation of molecular level  processes with laboratory-scale
              processing variables in electrochemical systems.  Molecular-level spectroscopic
              measurements are coupled to macroscopic transport and reaction processes.  An
              in situ  Raman or luminescent image provides a molecular-level "snapshot" of an
              electrochemical interface or boundary layer that can be resolved spatially with
              micrometer resolution.  These imaging capabilities allow the study of
              processing-property relationships in a variety of electrolytic or
              electrodeposition systems, including conducting polymers, ferroalloys, and
              biological systems.  They are especially useful when homogeneous chemistry in a
              reactive boundary layer is an important factor.  They also permit the study of
              the coupling between redox reactions (homogeneous or heterogeneous) and
              transport processes.    The processes studied represent the applications of
              electrochemical technology to modern "high-tech" devices, including advanced
              batteries, magnetic storage devices, fuel cells and space-age metals.  They are
              also applicable to separation and decontamination  procedures for chemicals,
              soils, and nuclear wastes.  ***
