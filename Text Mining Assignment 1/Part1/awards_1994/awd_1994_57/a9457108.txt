Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9457108  Cecilia Richards    Turbulent dispersion of droplets in
              turbulent jets, and particle behavior in two-phase reacting flows, will be
              experimentally investigated.    Dr. Richards will implement various design
              components in her teaching of undergraduate and students.  ***
