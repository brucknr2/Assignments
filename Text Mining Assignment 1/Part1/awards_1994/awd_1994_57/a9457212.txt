Abstract    :
              9457212  Pollard  The principal investigator will investigate electrical 
              waveform propagation during action potential depolarization  and repolarization
              using computer models of the heart.  High  performance computing will be
              employed to study propagation  across the heart wall, propagation between
              myocardium and  the conduction system, and the onset of re-entry.
