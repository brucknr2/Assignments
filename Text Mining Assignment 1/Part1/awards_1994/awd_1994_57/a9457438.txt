Abstract    :
              This research aims to extend current methods of time-frequency and  time-scale
              analysis by developing a general theory for signal  analysis and processing in
              alternative coordinate systems.   Specific tools under investigation include
              optimal, signal-  dependent time-scale representations, information measures
              for  time-frequency and time-scale analysis, and operator-based,  generalized
              coordinate systems.  Test signals are being drawn from  problems in machine
              health monitoring, magnetic resonance imaging,  and dispersive signal
              processing.
