Abstract    :
              9457693  Rubin  With this National Science Foundation Young Investigator (NYI) 
              award, the Synthetic Organic Program of the Chemistry Division  is supporting
              the research and teaching activities of Dr. Yves  F. Rubin of the Department of
              Chemistry and Biochemistry of the  University of California, Los Angeles.  The
              focus of Professor  Rubin's research is the functionalization of 
              buckminsterfullerene with an emphasis on the preparation of  compounds with
              biological relevance and new materials that  arise from mono- and
              regioselectively controlled  multicycloadditions. Also, the total synthesis of 
              buckminsterfullerene and its endohedral metal complexes from  acetylenic,
              bowl-shaped precursors will be investigated.  The  focus of Dr. Rubin's
              teaching activities will be  curriculum  development at both the undergraduate
              and graduate levels.
