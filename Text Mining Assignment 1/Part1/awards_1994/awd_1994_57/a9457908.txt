Abstract    :
              9457908  Gibble  A research program in experimental atomic physics will be 
              initiated.  The collisions of very slow moving atoms will be  studied.  This
              will lead to an attempt to condense such  ultracold atoms ("Bose
              condensation"), and to the  development of new atomic clocks of unprecedented
              stability  and accuracy.  ***
