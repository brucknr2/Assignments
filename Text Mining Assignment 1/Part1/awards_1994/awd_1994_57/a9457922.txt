Abstract    :
                                                Technical abstract:      The condensation of
              ferrofluids  in  both  zero and applied fields is of fundamental and  applied 
              interest.  It  is  proposed  to  investigate  the  following  aspects  of this
              field: 1) Phase separation in zero magnetic  field;  2)  new  structure induced
              by an externally  applied  magnetic  field,  and 3) Glassy behavior  due  to 
              competing  interactions  and  disorder in the  system.   The  study  is  guided
                by   searching  the  relation   between   geometry,  structure,  and 
              dynamics and understanding  the  effect  of  frustration  on  the  physical 
              properties  of  the  system.  Results  from this work will not only  improve
              the  existing  technology but will also lead to new directions and  greater 
              potential for future applications.      Nontechnical  abstract:       A
              ferrofluid/magnetic  colloid  is  a system consisting of magnetic nanoparticles
              (typically  100    in diameter) suspended in a nonmagnetic solvent.   It  has 
              wide  industrial  applications such  as  vacuum   feed-  throughs,   shaft 
              seals  used  in  computer  disk   drives,  mechanical  power transmission, etc.
               However, many  of  the  fascinating aspects of the physics of ferrofluids 
              have  not  been  worked  out.   Amazingly,  mechanisms  governing  many 
              phenomena  observed in the system are intimately related  to  some  
              fundamental   questions  in  condensed   matter   and  statistical  physics.  
              It  is  planned  to  carry   out   a  comprehensive  investigation  of 
              structure,  dynamics,  and  magnetic   properties  of  ferrofluids  with  
              emphasis   on  understanding the interplay between geometry, structure, and 
              dynamics.    Results  from  this  work  will   provide   new  directions  for
              improving the existing technology  and  will  lead to even greater potential
              for future applications.
