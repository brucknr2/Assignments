Abstract    :
              9457445  Walker    One of the major goals of both ground and space based
              observational  astronomy is the identification and study of protostellar
              objects.  A study of protostars will provide insight into the initial 
              conditions required for star formation, protostellar evolution, and  the
              formation of solar systems like our own.    Over the next five years the
              following research, which will involve  the participation of students, will be
              carried out:    1) conduct a vigorous observational search for protostellar
              objects  using telescopes operating at submillimeter wavelengths,      2) write
              the radiative transfer computer codes needed to interpret  the complex
              spectroscopic line profiles obtained by observing  candidate objects, and    
              3) construct the low-noise submillimeter wavelength heterodyne  receivers
              needed to successfully detect infall and other  motions associated with
              material around protostars. Two graduate  students will be working on thesis
              projects related to these goals.    The research program at the University of
              Arizona has an  established laboratory for the development of state-of-the-art 
              submillimeter wavelength receiver systems.  Receivers for the 
              Arizona/Max-Planck-Institute fur Radioastronomie (MPifR)  submillimeter
              telescope operating in the 1300, 870, 610, 450, and  350 micron wavelength
              atmospheric windows will be constructed.  A dual-channel (610/370 micron
              wavelength), low-noise receiver will  be constructed for use on a 1.7m
              submillimeter wavelength telescope  at the South Pole.  The receiver will be
              used to observe the  distribution of atomic carbon in the Milky Way and other
              galaxies  visible from the South Pole.  There will be participation in the 
              analysis and interpretation of the huge astronomical data base that  will be
              generated by making the observations.    New technology will be used to
              construct a high performance,  heterodyne array instrument which will consist
              of a 5 by 5 array of  receivers. This instrument will increase the scientific
              throughput   of the telescope by at least a factor of 25. Projects which were 
              previously unthinkable due to limited telescope time will become  tractable.   
              %%%    This award is to recognize an outstanding young faculty member in 
              science and engineering.  This award will enhance his career by  providing
              flexible support for research and educational activities.   Cooperation with
              industry and institutions that support research  and education is encouraged.
