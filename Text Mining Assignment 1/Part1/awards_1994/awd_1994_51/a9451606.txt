Abstract    :
              9451606  Campbell  A high-resolution germanium photon detector and associated 
              electronics will be acquired for use in a variety of experiments in  the
              advanced undergraduate laboratory as well as for independent  studies.  Among
              the experiments to be done are the study of  characteristic x rays from various
              elements, determination of  gamma-ray absorption coefficients, gamma-ray
              spectroscopy of  radioactive isotopes from environmental sources, Compton 
              scattering, and neutron activation.  These experiments will give  undergraduate
              students hands-on experience with radioactivity and  with modern
              high-resolution spectroscopy applied to x rays and  gamma rays.
