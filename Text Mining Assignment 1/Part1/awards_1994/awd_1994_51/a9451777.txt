Abstract    :
              9451777  Cluley                               Nondestructive testing (NDT) of
              aging steel and concrete structures  for detecting deterioration and damage to
              constructed facilities  has been introduced in a concrete testing laboratory.
              Students use  information from NDT to determine the effects of aging on the 
              resistive capacity of concrete structures by comparing analyses of  concrete
              frames using the material properties as found by NDT with  solutions which
              assume conventional design values for these same  properties. Concrete
              specimens are also tested under loads through  the service range to observe
              cracking and deflection, and up to the  ultimate load capacity to observe
              ductile capacity and failure  mode. The results of NDTs on these specimens help
              explain any  discrepancies with resistive capacities calculated using ACI 
              strength formulas. Testing is also conducted on steel specimens to  determine
              stresses, column buckling loads, and lateral buckling of  beams. The results
              are compared with AISC Code predictions and  discrepancies are explained in
              light of test observations. The  service load and ultimate load tests are
              conducted using an  enhanced test setup which allows testing of full-scale
              specimens  with the aid of automatic data acquisition equipment. The 
              experiments in NDT also indicate how to determine where more  rigorous
              maintenance procedures should be used, and provide  information concerning the
              appropriateness of the various  structural design codes. The laboratory
              features group learning by  students and emphasizes oral and written
              communications.
