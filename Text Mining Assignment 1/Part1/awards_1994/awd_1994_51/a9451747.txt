Abstract    :
              9451747  Cameron                              The objective of the project is to
              develop a laboratory component  to a new course - Acoustics, Noise and
              Vibration.  GMI students and their employers represent a broad spectrum of 
              manufacturers. For many of these manufacturers the control of noise  and
              vibration has become a major concern as public demand has  increased for
              smoother and quieter appliances, vehicals, etc.   Employees in industrial firms
              also require protection from  potential harmful industrial noises and
              vibrations.  The intent of the Acoustics, Noise and Vibration course is to 
              convey physical insight into these processes by covering the theory  of
              acoustics and vibration while presenting practical examples of  solutions to
              frequently encountered noise and vibration problems.   This project supports
              this course by the creation of a laboratory  which will have exercises
              developed around a Modal/Spectrum  analyzer capable of both bodal and acoustic
              data acquisition and  analysis.  These exercises will give students hands-on
              experience  with the equipment and procedures used in industry for noise and 
              vibration measurement while demonstrating underlying physical  principles.
              Exercises will include tests to determine: noise  generated by mechanisms and
              machine components; noise attenuation  in materials, and active and passive
              silencers; and the  cross-correlation of noise with modal vibrations in
              structures.
