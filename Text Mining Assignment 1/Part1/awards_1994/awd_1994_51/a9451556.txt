Abstract    :
              9451556  Morstad                                                   A Mathematics
              Computer laboratory is being developed for use with  all sections of the
              calculus sequence. The three main goals are: 1.  To help students construct
              mathematical concepts through active  exploration in a computer laboratory
              setting. 2. To motivate  students to think and communicate about mathematics by
              stimulating  discussion in the laboratory setting and by requiring students to 
              write about their results. 3. To model effective teaching methods  for
              Secondary Education Mathematics majors and provide them with  experience in
              teaching mathematics in a controlled laboratory  setting.
