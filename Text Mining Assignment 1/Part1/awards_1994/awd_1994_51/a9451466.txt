Abstract    :
              9451466  Halpern  The Department of Mathematics of Brooklyn College is equipping
              a  classroom and a laboratory with computers for use in advanced  post-calculus
              courses serving the needs of mathematics, computer  and information science,
              secondary mathematics education, science,  pre-engineering, and pre-med
              students. The aim of the project is to  enhance the courses by enabling
              instructors to present topics in  their lectures both graphically and
              numerically and by deepening  the students' understanding of core ideas of
              mathematics and the  classical interplay of arithmetic, algebra and geometry
              via the  computer.
