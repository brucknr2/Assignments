Abstract    :
              9451131  Wildi                               The project will purchase a
              permanent magnet, FT-NMR, for use in  upgrading the curriculum in several
              chemistry courses.  These  include introductory chemistry, organic chemistry,
              an  instrumentation course for non-chemistry majors, and advanced level 
              laboratory.  In addition, the instrument will be used in  undergraduate
              research projects. The student body is about 75%  women who will be served by
              these improvements.  There are also  plans to do outreach to help upgrade
              teaching at local schools.    This project will fit well into the Chemistry
              Department objectives  which include: 1. To continually update lecture material
              in all  courses to reflect advances in the field of chemistry; 2. To 
              strengthen all laboratory courses by providing hands-on experience  with modern
              instrumentation of the quality and type comparable to  that used in research
              and industry; 3. To enrich the Department of  Chemistry programs by providing
              increased opportunities for  students to engage in independent projects using
              research quality  instrumentation; 4. To acquaint the students with modern
              techniques  in computational analysis and computer data acquisition methods; 5.
               To replace and upgrade existing equipment for purposes of increased 
              efficiency and versatility in all laboratory courses.
