Abstract    :
              9451442  Sherren                              The Chemistry Department is
              acquiring a GC/MS in support of  continuation of its ongoing program to promote
              chemical inquiry  based laboratory instruction.  The instrument is being used
              by  students across the entire departmental curriculum, from non-majors  and
              students in related programs such as pre-health sciences and  pre-engineering
              through advanced courses for chemistry majors.  A  emphasis is being placed on
              investigations of both naturally  occurring and synthetic mixtures in the
              consumer marketplace.
