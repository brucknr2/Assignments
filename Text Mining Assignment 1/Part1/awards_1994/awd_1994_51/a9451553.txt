Abstract    :
              9451553  Poston  The goal of this proposal is the development of a laboratory 
              component requiring students to solve problems utilizing multiple  laboratory
              techniques. An advanced laboratory course will be  developed in which students
              draw upon laboratory skills acquired  in general, organic, analytical, and
              instrumental analysis to  solve problems posed in real life scenarios that
              simulate  investigations a laboratory chemist might encounter. The students 
              will gain experience in developing problem-solving approaches,  obtaining and
              preparing samples for analysis, analyzing data  collected from several
              techniques, determining the relevance of  collected data, and articulating the
              results of an investigation  in a format appropriate to the type of inquiry.
              The  investigations will rely heavily on such instrumental techniques  as gas
              chromatography (GC), high pressure liquid chromatography  (HPLC), atomic
              absorption spectroscopy (AA), infrared  spectroscopy (FT-IR), and mass
              spectroscopy (MS). This proposal  requests funds for the acquisition of the
              GC-MS system, graphite  furnace (AA applications) and ion specific electrodes
              necessary  to enable implementation of this course. Use of the requested 
              equipment will not be restricted to the advanced laboratory  course described
              in this proposal. The GC-MS system will be used  throughout our program. It
              will be introduced in general  chemistry and extensively used in organic and
              instrumental  analysis. The graphite furnace will be used in instrumental 
              analysis and the ion selective electrodes in the general,  analytical and
              instrumental courses. It is anticipated that about  150 students per year will
              gain direct experience with this  equipment.
