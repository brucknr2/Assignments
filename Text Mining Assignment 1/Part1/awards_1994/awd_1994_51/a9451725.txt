Abstract    :
              Six neurophysiology workstations, capable of both intracellular and 
              extracellular neurorecording techniques, will equip a new  one-semester
              upper-level undergraduate Neurobiology course.  Students will design
              experiments to elucidate important phenomena  in cellular and integrative
              neurobiology, such as the ionic bases  of the resting and action potentials,
              coding of sensory  information, synaptic integration, and modulation of
              synapses. The  proposed equipment will also be used to improve teaching of 
              elementary principles of neurobiology in the General Biology  course, and to
              expand the range of opportunities for student  research projects. Funding of
              this proposal will permit integration  into the curriculum of a major field of
              biological inquiry, and  remedy the only major deficiency that remains after
              several years  of sustained curricular improvement.
