Abstract    :
              9451814  Noble                                                     A instruction
              laboratory is being established for introductory  statistics courses to develop
              data analysis skills that will be  applied in other laboratories and student
              research, and to  introduce examples relevant to the curriculum in the social
              and  life sciences. The project will create team taught  multi-disciplinary
              introductory statistics courses and thereby  integrate statistics instruction
              in the mathematics department with  the curriculum in economics, psychology,
              anthropology, government  and biology. The laboratory will provide a hands-on
              learning  environment in which students can practice the methods and 
              experimentally explore the concepts presented in lecture. The lab  will also
              provide an opportunity for students to learn computing  intensive methods such
              as graphical data exploration, resampling  techniques, and a variety of
              multi-variate techniques.
