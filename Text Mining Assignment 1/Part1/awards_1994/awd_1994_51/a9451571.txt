Abstract    :
              9451571  Granger  Chemistry students will be introduced to modern, state of the
              art,  chromatography instrumentation and techniques involving high  pressure
              liquid chromatography (HPLC). The major impact on the  undergraduates will be
              in the Intermediate and Advanced integrated  laboratory courses directed by the
              Chemistry department. These  upper level courses are designed to present
              laboratory techniques  and methods as applied to realistic questions and
              applications. As  well, we plan to initiate exposure to the technique and the 
              instrument in at least one introductory (general) chemistry  laboratory for
              science and non-science majors. These underclassmen  will be introduced to
              chromatographic principles in lecture as well  as lab. Juniors and Seniors will
              be involved in using the system in  mini-research projects at the end of the
              Integrated and Advanced  laboratory series and will also have the opportunity
              to use the  system in faculty directed undergraduate research programs. 
              Applications involve organic and biochemical systems as well as  fundamental
              analytical chemistry and techniques.
