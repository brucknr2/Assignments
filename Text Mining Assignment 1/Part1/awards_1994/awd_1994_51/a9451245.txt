Abstract    :
              9451245  Ogden                                                     Students
              majoring in biology and biochemistry receive hands-on  training using modern
              technical procedures, instrumentation and  computers, thereby enhancing their
              preparation and stimulating  their interest in pursuing careers in the
              biological sciences.  Project-oriented laboratories are introduced in the
              Recombinant DNA  and Biochemistry courses.  New laboratory exercises have also
              been  introduced in Molecular Biology, Immunology, Microbiology and  Medical
              Microbiology courses.
