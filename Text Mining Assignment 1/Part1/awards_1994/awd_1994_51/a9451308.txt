Abstract    :
              9451308  Irvin  A dedicated computer laboratory is being developed to introduce 
              real-world collaborative problem-solving laboratories in  precalculus,
              calculus, linear algebra, and differential equations  courses.C The goal of the
              project is to integrate five major  curricular improvements throughout the
              college-level math classes:  To prepare students to work with the kinds of
              sophisticated  mathematical software they will encounter in upper-division math
               courses or on the job; To incorporate real-world computer-based  simulations,
              applications, visualizations, and problem-solving  exercises that will
              translate the often-theoretical world of  mathematics to practical applications
              that students can identify  and handle; To utilize computer-based calculation
              software to  foster student experimentation, manipulation, and problem-solving 
              with mathematical concepts and relationships; To diversify the  presentation of
              mathematical skills and concepts to accommodate the  range in learning styles
              among Howard Community College students;   To assist students in developing
              team skills and collaborative  problem-solving techniques.
