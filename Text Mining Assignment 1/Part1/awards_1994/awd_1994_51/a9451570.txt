Abstract    :
              9451570  Jameson                              This proposal is for the assembly
              of a 200 MHz NMR spectrometer for  undergraduate instruction from a
              decommissioned spectrometer. We  propose to utilize only the low-level rf
              section and the magnet  from older systems. The transformation includes a state
              of the art  PC based computer, peripherals, timing section, and pulse 
              programmer. The result will be a high-field spectrometer which will  be
              routinely used in many undergraduate courses. At Loyola  University we will
              transform our pedagogy from one in which  hands-on NMR spectroscopy is almost
              non-existent in the beginning  Organic courses into one in which a high-field
              spectrometer plays  a routine and integral part of the course, separating
              acquisition  from processing, thereby making possible 25 student spectra in one
               hour of laboratory. In Instrumental Analysis the students will  understand the
              conversion between time and frequency domain data.  They will delve into
              understanding the manner in which optimal  control of experimental parameters
              is related to instrument design.  We wish to have our undergraduate students
              become more  sophisticated in the use of NMR spectroscopy so that their 
              undergraduate research will be significantly enriched, and make  them better
              prepared for their future chemistry careers. We suggest  that assembling an NMR
              spectrometer for undergraduate instruction  from existing commercial modules is
              quite possible, well within the  competence of capable spectroscopists (NMR or
              not) or Instrumental  Analysis instructor. We will demonstrate that a
              spectrometer can be  obtained for a cost well below $100,000. Ten year old
              (entirely  serviceable) 4.7T magnets (200 Mhz 1H) are becoming available from 
              the decommissioning of older instruments, prices ($15-35K)  depending on
              availability, extras and demand. An extremely useful  instructional tool is
              possible.
