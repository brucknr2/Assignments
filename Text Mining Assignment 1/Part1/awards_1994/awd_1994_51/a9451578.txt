Abstract    :
              9451578  Ibrahim  The instrumentation and control systems experiments and
              manuals  developed in this project are used to instruct electrical,  chemical,
              mechanical, industrial, bio-medical, and environmental  engineers and
              engineering technologists. The laboratory integrates  physical systems and
              instrumentation with computer software and  hardware. The computers are used
              for simulation, data logging and  analysis, and as controllers for physical
              systems with their  inherent nonlinearities. The basic software packages used
              in the  laboratory are Lab View, Matlab/Simulink, CC and Excel. The wide  range
              of laboratory experiences developed can be readily duplicated  or adapted to
              meet the curricular goals of other institutions.
