Abstract    :
              9451360  Hoft                                                      The
              University of Michigan at Dearborn in cooperation with Eastern  Michigan
              University and Siena Heights is developing an upper level  interactive and
              interdisciplinary laboratory course for mathematics  and computer science which
              channels some of the recent  technological advances in communications and
              computations into the  undergraduate mathematics curriculum. At the center of
              the course  is the interplay between mathematics and computer science and its 
              effect on computational mathematics. A computer algebra system is  used
              interactively for all teaching and learning activities in the  classroom and
              the laboratory. This helps students to integrate  ideas, concepts, and
              applications from both fields in a natural and  transparent way. The teaching
              model of the course is based on  interactive learning materials, locating the
              laboratory wherever a  student and a computer running the software interact,
              and on the  extensive use of electronic communication between students and 
              faculty, distributing the laboratory through access to the  Internet.  The
              course content is designed for the junior/senior  level of the mathematics and
              computer science curricula, and it  builds on topics and concepts in the
              sophomore level core of both  fields. The course fits into a curriculum on
              mathematics,  computational mathematics and computer science with minor changes
               in emphasis only. The course is particularly well suited for  academic
              institutions where mathematics and computer science are  programs in a single
              department.  The materials for the course,  including a teacher's manual and a
              collection of student projects,  are being printed and electronic form.
