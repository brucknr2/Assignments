Abstract    :
              9451887  Niedzwiedz  The Geography and Public & Environmental Affairs programs
              at the  University of Wisconsin-Green Bay are seeking funds to incorporate 
              state-of-the-art methods of Geographic Information Systems into our 
              undergraduate GIS Lab curriculum. Given student demand for GIS  courses and the
              evolution of GIS technology, our GIS Lab is  seriously deficient in equipment
              and software.     The improvements proposed incorporate results of the NSF
              supported  National Center of Geographic Information and Analysis (NCGIA) 
              study of core curriculum requirements for GIS. The improvements  will provide
              our students with strong hands-on training in raster  and UNIX vector GIS
              systems, GIS concepts, geocoding, data  structures and editing, the building of
              topology, analytical  modeling, GIS applications and cartographic presentation.
              The  requested equipment will allow major improvements in the  Geographic/Land
              Information Systems course and allow immediate  development of three new GIS
              courses: Advanced Methods in GIS,  Environmental Applications of GIS (an
              innovative team-oriented  course), and GIS Applications in Business (tentative
              title). Four  additional courses also will experience significant improvement. 
              With the new equipment, image processing and several levels of  networking are
              made possible. Additionally, the proposed  improvements will allow
              implementation of a local GIS Adopt-A-  School Program. This innovative program
              is designed to enrich  education within environmental science, earth science,
              and  geography curricula. The improvements will ensure that students  receive
              up-to-date training in the technology and methods that are  becoming important
              tools for the stewards of our natural, social  and economic systems.
