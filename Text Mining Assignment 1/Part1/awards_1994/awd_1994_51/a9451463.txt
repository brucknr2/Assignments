Abstract    :
              9451463  Thompson                                                  A
              ultraviolet-visible-near infrared spectrophotometer specifically  enhanced for
              analytical and biochemical applications significantly  affecting intermediate
              and advanced levels of the curriculum.  Students are gaining experience with
              such modern techniques as  ultra-fast scanning, high resolution spectroscopy,
              diffuse  reflectance measurements, computerized quantitative analysis and 
              kinetics analysis, DNA melts, gel scanning, rapid temperature  control,
              controlled mixing, and remote instrument operation. Over  a three-year period
              approximately 100 undergraduates will have  hands-on experience with the
              instrument, while others are  benefitting from materials prepared through use
              of the instrument.
