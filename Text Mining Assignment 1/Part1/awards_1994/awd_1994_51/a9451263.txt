Abstract    :
              The aim of the project is to develop a multimedia, PC-based, power  system
              simulator to interface, via real time data acquisition and  control, to
              programmable logic controllers. A variety of  operations, ranging from simple
              DC motor control to complex  synchronous generator modelling can be simulated.
              The goal of the  multimedia presentation is to augment Junior- level power
              systems  labs with simulation-based exercises that "connect" the laboratory  to
              the real world. The simulation exercises provide videotaped  illustrations of
              an actual power plant, the operation and  description of sensors, and a
              detailed description of the control  objectives.
