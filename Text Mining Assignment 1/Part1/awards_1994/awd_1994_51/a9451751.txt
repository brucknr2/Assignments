Abstract    :
              9451751  Delemesster  A computer laboratory for economics has been established
              and is  designed to strengthen the pedagogical effectiveness of teaching 
              undergraduate economics. The experimental markets approach is used,  and
              students gain a better understanding of economic behavior  through interactive
              participation rather than only through passive  learning. The use of economic
              experiments in instruction also  enables students to experience the functioning
              of markets and to  discover (or reinforce) the principles of economics in a
              laboratory  setting. The computer lab consists of personal computers linked to 
              a local area network. The networked system is necessary to run  real-time
              experiments, such as a double-auction market, which  requires shared
              information.
