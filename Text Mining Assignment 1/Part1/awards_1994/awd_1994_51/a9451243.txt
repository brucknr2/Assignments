Abstract    :
              9451243  Crittenden  Too many of our precalculus and calculus students do not
              seem able  to learn to think about mathematics, but only to perform rote 
              computations. Too many do not even make it through the course.  A  computer
              laboratory to accompany calculus courses addresses these  problems.  The
              project follows successful pilot projects that have  been run since the Fall of
              1990.  The first project used Apple  IIe's in 12 of 77 calculus sections over a
              period of two years.   During the summer of 1993 these machines were replaced
              by 15 486  PC's with Maple V, to offer an optional lab in 7 of 40 sections in 
              the 1993-94 academic year.  Simple algorithms first, and then the  more
              sophisticated commands and graphics of Maple were employed  successfully to
              generate data that the students use to develop  intuitions about theoretical
              relations, to gain a deeper  understanding of the theory, and to make it
              credible through  verifying examples.  The addition of 30 Gateway 4DX2-66's
              builds  upon the successful pilot experiences by providing a sufficient  number
              of PC's to make these labs a required part of the calculus  sections.  The 30
              new machines allow the expansion of the current  facility to 20 machines and
              establishment of a second, dedicated  computer lab of 25 PC's with Maple V, to
              handle classes of as many  as 45.  The project will result in a laboratory
              manual and the  requirement of a laboratory component for all calculus sections
               which allows the experiences of the laboratory to be integrated in  the
              teaching of the calculus.  Future plans include using the  laboratory for
              pre-calculus as well as calculus.
