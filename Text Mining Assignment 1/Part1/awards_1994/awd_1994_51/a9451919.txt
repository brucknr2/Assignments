Abstract    :
              9451919  Haglin                                                    Parallel
              processing is demanding an ever-increasing role in modern  computer science.
              This is apparent in modern computer architectures  and is reflected in the ACM
              curriculum guidelines.  The purpose of  this proposal is to provide a
              significant exposure to parallel  processing for the undergraduate students at
              Mankato State  University. This exposure will be provided through changes to 
              several existing courses by adding one or more parallel processing  lab
              exercises to each course and by a new course devoted entirely  to parallel
              processing.  A MasPar MP-1 processor has been  identified to serve as the
              hardware platform.  This processor will  provide students with a high degree of
              parallelism and a user  interface built upon the familiar Unix/C/X-windows
              base.   Documentation of the experiences, including both successes and 
              difficulties, will be published allowing other universities to  better evaluate
              this approach and platform.
