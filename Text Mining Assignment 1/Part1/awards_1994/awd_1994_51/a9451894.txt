Abstract    :
              9451894  Poskozim                             The project will purchase a
              Differential Scanning Calorimeter  (TA-2000 DSC 912 Dual Sample System) and
              build or assemble a  non-commercial thermogravimetric unit. The two instruments
              will  share computers. Both instruments will be rapidly phased into  existing
              chemistry lab courses, significantly upgrading experiments  and creating new
              ones. It is expected that knowledge gained in  constructing the sophisticated
              thermal gravimetric instrument from  available, rather inexpensive parts, will
              inspire others to build  similar instruments, thereby expanding participation
              in the field.  The project, begun in Spring of 1994, should be completed by the
               end of that year. Over their projected lifetimes, both instruments  will be
              used directly by numerous students and faculty. Hands on  experience and
              expertise gained by students should further their  scientific careers. A goal
              of the project is to design new  experiments related to thermal analysis for
              labs in advanced  inorganic, physical chemistry, instrumental analysis,
              analytical,  and even general chemistry. Another project goal is the
              compilation  of a library of standard thermograms insofar as possible for 
              distribution to the scientific community.
