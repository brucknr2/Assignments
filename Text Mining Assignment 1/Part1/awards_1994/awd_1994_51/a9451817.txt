Abstract    :
              9451817  Thompson                                                          This
              project is helping to carry out a plan to enhance a major  component of the
              Mechanical Engineering curriculum. The plan  requires modification of existing
              courses and introduction of new  courses and laboratories. The objective is to
              prepare our  engineering graduates to design dynamic physical systems which 
              include intelligent sensors and actuators and embedded control  systems. The
              changes needed to reach this objective are:  1. Strengthen the electrical
              engineering science component of our  curriculum to provide more instruction in
              applied electronics and  computer circuits.  2. Strengthen the dynamic systems
              modeling and analysis component  of our curriculum to provide analytical and
              experimental methods in  modeling, analysis and simulation of dynamic physical
              systems.  3. Strengthen the automatic control system design technical  elective
              component of our curriculum to provide both analog and  digital control system
              design, analysis and implementation.  This project is creating a new integrated
              dynamics and control  laboratory which will serve the two new courses and one
              of the  modified courses.  The laboratory incorporates seven different  types
              of experiments (torsional mass, mass/spring/damper system,  inverted pendulum,
              3-D robot, heat transfer, electronic cooling,  and mixing).  The detailed
              design and manufacture of the  experimental apparatus is being performed by
              teams of honors  research students.
