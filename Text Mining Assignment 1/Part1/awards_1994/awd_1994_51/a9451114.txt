Abstract    :
              This proposal is based on an inter-disciplinary collaboration, in  the form of a
              senior design project, between the Textile  Engineering Department and the
              Materials Engineering Department.   During the course of the project teams of
              students will choose a  specific product that can be manufactured using textile
              composites  (e.g. golf club, baseball bat, handicapped walker). This will be 
              followed by literature review of related topics, material  selection,
              constituent materials property prediction, engineering  design, manufacturing
              and testing of the textile composites  product. Industrial partners,
              manufacturing textile composites  (e.g. Tech. Textiles USA), will be invited to
              provide expertise and  supplies for this project.
