Abstract    :

              physiology is best explored through active, personal  participation. The
              project will implement a new approach to  laboratory instruction in
              Horticulture 301 (Plant Physiology).  Its  goal is to achieve a better balance
              between presenting factual  content and allowing students to become personally
              engaged in the  process of scientific inquiry. The proposal seeks funds for an 
              array of instruments, including a gas chromatograph, a  photosynthesis
              measurement system, spectrophotometers,  psychrometers, electrophoresis
              equipment, centrifuges, incubators  and plant growth chambers. These devices
              will be used in a  two-stage approach to instruction. First, a "core" of nine
              lab  experiments will engage students in structured studies of plant 
              physiology and will teach the principles of modern techniques of  measurement.
              Second, after students have mastered a body of  technical skills, they will be
              presented with several  demonstrations of plant responses, where the underlying
              cause of  the phenomenon is not evident. Working in small groups, students 
              will observe the response, consider possible explanations and  hypothesize on
              the underlying mechanisms. After study plans have  been approved, students will
              proceed to investigate their problem.  Various approaches and outcomes will be
              possible, but the essence  of the structure is that it permits open-ended
              inquiry, where  initial results are explained, new hypotheses are constructed
              and  new experiments are designed.
