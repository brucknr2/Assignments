Abstract    :
              9451944  Cushing                                       An interdisciplinary team
              of faculty in biology, chemistry and computer science recognize both the 
              criticality and challenge of integrating scientific visualization into the
              undergraduate curriculum. They  propose to use the computer graphics hardware
              and software in conjunction with existing personal  computer laboratories and
              computation workstations to support (1) advanced student projects using and 
              developing software for scientific visualization, (2) undergraduate student
              research, and (3) image  generation for use in sophomore-level introductory
              science programs.
