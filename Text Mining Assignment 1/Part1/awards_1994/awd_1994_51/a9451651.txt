Abstract    :
              This project focuses upon the creation of an interactive physical  sciences
              computer lab at Trident's Main Campus, as well as the  incorporation of
              computers into the physics labs for data  acquisition and analysis.  The use of
              the interactive physical  sciences computer lab, which supports both chemistry
              and physics,  has been integrated with assignments in the chemistry and physics
               wet labs to reinforce concepts and provide students a more  comprehensive
              understanding of entry-level and college transfer  physical sciences. This
              approach encourages further exploration and  practice on the part of the
              students so they can proceed to more  complicated experiments in a safe
              environment.  A computer  interfaced with traditional laboratory equipment in
              the physics  labs enables the student to store, manipulate, and retrieve data 
              from any particular experiment.  Through the use of innovative and  integrated
              course delivery between the existing wet labs and the  proposed interactive
              lab, students become more involved in  sciences, develop a better knowledge
              base from which to progress to  upper level courses, and they become more
              confident in pursuing a  science-related career path. The proposed approach of
              combining  lecture, wet lab, and computer lab in the teaching of physical 
              sciences provides the student with an integrated learning  environment.
