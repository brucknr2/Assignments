Abstract    :
              9451475  Chandrasekhar  The University of Missouri will add modern spectroscopy
              experiments  to the Optics Laboratory for the upper division Light and Modern 
              Optics course. The equipment will also be used for demonstration  purposes in
              Modern Physics and for Undergraduate Research. Atomic  Molecular and Solid
              State Spectra will be studied.  Two modern  spectrometers will be set up to
              perform Raman and  fluorescence/photoluminescence studies at room and low 
              temperatures. The spectrometers will be set up so that the four  experiments
              can be performed with minimal or no change in the  alignment. This feature is
              critical in a limited time laboratory  class.  A Fabry Perot triple pass
              interferometer which lacks a few  components will be completed and will be used
              to perform Brillouin  scattering and laser mode studies.  A Fourier transform 
              spectrometer will be set up to study the vibrational modes in  liquids and
              solids, and will be a complementary tool to the Raman  and Fabry Perot
              spectrometers.  All the above instruments will be  computer controlled. At
              present our Optics laboratory lacks all of  the above instruments, and we are
              able only to perform experiments  where data is taken manually, so that
              intensity measurements and  comparison with theory is not possible. The
              instrumentation above  will provide a closer link between the theory studied in
              class and  the experiments done in the lab.
