Abstract    :
              9451439  O'Neill                                                   This project
              involves equipment which allows us to maintain living  specimens in the lab and
              to modify our program to include  physiology and molecular biology using
              contemporary methods of  investigation. Marine biology is a non-majors course
              and for many  students, including those transferring into primary teaching 
              credential programs, their only exposure to college biology. It is  important
              that our laboratory exercises reflect the diversity of  modern biology. Also,
              exercise are being developed that will be  incorporated into a "soft manual"
              and made available to instructors  at other schools. Circulation of a soft
              laboratory manual will  allow instructors to tailor their curriculum to fit
              their  individual needs and resources.
