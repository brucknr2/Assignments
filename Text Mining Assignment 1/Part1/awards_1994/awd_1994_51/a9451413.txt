Abstract    :
              9451413  Werner  Spatial analysis and Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
              integrate  previously separate disciplines. Therefore, this project allows 
              undergraduate students to synthesize their studies in Geography,  Biology, and
              Environmental Studies using the spatial data and  methods available in GIS to
              model environmental problems. The  project permits faculty to demonstrate a
              wide range of analyses,  and enhances learning by allowing the students to
              implement the  principles of spatial analyses and experiment with algorithms
              and  input parameters. This project also integrates our curricula,  enabling
              students to link data, projects, and methodology among  such disciplines as
              geography, biology, and environmental studies.
