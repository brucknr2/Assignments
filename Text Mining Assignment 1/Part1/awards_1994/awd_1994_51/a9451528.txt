Abstract    :
              9451528  Dorner                                                         Pacific
              Lutheran University is equipping a modern computer  classroom that will deliver
              to mathematics and science students,  especially future teachers of
              mathematics, an environment where the  use of current technology is natural and
              becomes second nature.  Students are using the computer both as an aid to
              problem solving  and as a tool for writing mathematics as they work on daily 
              assignments of a realistic nature as well as more extensive  projects requiring
              a formal presentation of results.  These future  teachers are getting
              experience on the type of computers in use in  many school systems and will
              have experience with the best  mathematical software. More importantly, these
              future teachers are  becoming experienced first hand the use of technology in
              group  problem solving activities that exemplify the best current  approaches
              to mathematics education. They also have the opportunity  to work as assistants
              in classrooms where they help provide  instruction via this approach.
