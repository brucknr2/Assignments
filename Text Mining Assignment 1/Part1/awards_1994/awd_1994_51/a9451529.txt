Abstract    :
              9451529  Davis                                Chesterfield-Marlboro Technical
              College, a small (1,020-student),  rural two-year college engaged in technician
              education at the  Associate degree level, proposes to improve its approach to
              Machine  Tool Technology instruction through the development of a laboratory 
              course in Integrated Manufacturing Systems.  The new course will provide a
              laboratory environment centered  around a modular integrated manufacturing
              cell, permitting students  to perform experiments and develop scientific and
              technical skills  in the fields of applied metallurgy, precision measurement, 
              statistical process control, robotics, metalworking, computer  numerical
              control, and programmable logic controller theory in any  integrated format
              which simulates the interactive, process-based  technology of modern
              manufacturing.  While the college presently  teaches the individual skills
              described above, there is no  opportunity for students to perform experiments
              and projects which  apply these techniques in the collaborative, integrative
              structure  which is typical of a modern production environment.    The
              equipment required to develop the proposed course includes a  lab-scale
              Computer Integrated Manufacturing cell, together with a  personal computer for
              process input and statistical process control  data analysis, and two computer
              output devices.
