Abstract    :
              9451893  Beatty  This project is designed for teaching introductory biology to
              both  majors and non-majors in a large course setting. The new course  with
              laboratory is also expected to become the institution's  largest-enrollment
              introductory biology course.  Central topics are  genetics, evolutionary
              biology, ecology, and the process of  scientific inquiry. Laboratories for the
              course are designed to use  the educational strategies of "conceptual change"
              teaching and  "collaborative group" learning. We also combine computer
              simulation  exercises with experiments involving plants and animals with rapid 
              life-cycles in one laboratory period. Computer stations are  established in
              four laboratories, and the stations are designed for  students to work in
              pairs. In addition, one TA computing station is  used to introduce and train
              students in software. Concepts and  processes with graphics and animations can
              also be illustrated.
