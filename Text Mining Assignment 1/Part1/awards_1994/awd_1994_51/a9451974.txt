Abstract    :
              9451974  Redborg  Molecular Biology equipment allows addition of PCR and gene 
              sequencing to two recently introduced courses; Techniques in  Molecular Biology
              and Molecular Genetics.  In addition the  equipment is used to further
              student's independent research  projects.
