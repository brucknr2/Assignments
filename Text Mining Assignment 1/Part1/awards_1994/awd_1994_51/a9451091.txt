Abstract    :
              9451091  Hadley  This project, which includes the development of several laser- 
              based experiments in Raman spectroscopy, laser fluorescence,  and 
              excited-state dynamics, will be at the center of a modernization  program in
              our undergraduate physical chemistry laboratory  program. The project will have
              a beneficial effect on our other  upper-division laboratory courses as well,
              including   instrumental analysis and analytical chemistry.  Students will 
              perform three sets of experiments using a pulsed nitrogen laser  and attendant
              equipment:    1) The fluorescence and absorption spectrum of I2, with special 
              attention paid to the nature of state-selected excited electronic  and
              vibrational states as well as their lifetimes.    2)   A Raman and IR study of
              CCl4, wherein students will compare  the vibrational information derived from
              each type of  spectroscopy and determine bond forces.    3) A dynamic study of
              the fate of excited states of rare-earth  complexes with the intent of studying
              the effects of fluorescence  quenching, ligand rigidity, and solvent viscosity
              on the  lifetimes of these complexes.
