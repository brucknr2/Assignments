Abstract    :
              9451937  Ott                                                          The
              Evergreen State College proposes to improve and expand its  upper-division
              laboratory instruction in physiology by purchasing  nine networked work
              stations to enhance student explorations in  muscle, cardiac, respiratory and
              neurophysiology. Each station will  include a computer with the necessary
              transducers, hardware and  software. The College's curriculum consists
              primarily of full-time  integrated, interdisciplinary programs. Instruction in
              laboratory  physiology centers on an upper-division program integrating 
              physiology, molecular biology, organic and biochemistry. A second  program
              emphasizes neurophysiology integrated with cognition and  philosophy.
              Laboratories in both programs will be greatly improved  by allowing the
              collection and immediate analysis of a variety of  physiological data such as
              electroencephalograms,  electrocardiograms and electromyograms. Advanced
              students, also  currently hampered by the lack of sophisticated equipment, can 
              follow up on proposed experiments. The new instruments will provide  much
              broader and more up-to-date laboratory instruction than  currently available
              and will greatly strengthen a program that has  been very successful in
              preparing many students for more advanced  studies.
