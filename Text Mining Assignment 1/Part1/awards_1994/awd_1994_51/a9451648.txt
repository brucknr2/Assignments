              Southern University requests matching funds to purchase a  300 MHz Fourier
              Transform Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectrometer  (FT-NMR). This purchase will
              greatly enhance the laboratory  experience of undergraduate chemistry students
              across the chemistry  curriculum. This instrument will provide a capability not
              currently  available at this school or the entire South Georgia region: 
              structural determination and observation of dynamic processes using  the most
              powerful of spectroscopic techniques.  Student exposure to  the instrument will
              begin at the sophomore level and continue  throughout the chemistry curriculum,
              affecting all classes above  the general chemistry level and playing a central
              role in two new  courses under development. Additionally, dozens of chemistry 
              students and faculty from three other area colleges will have  controlled
              access to the instrument. Through the cooperation  between these colleges and
              GSU, the benefits of this powerful NMR  spectrometer will be felt beyond GSU
              itself.
