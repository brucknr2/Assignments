Abstract    :
              9451324  Tsang                                                     This project
              will implement a sophomore-level laboratory course on  materials, manufacturing
              and design. The course will be activity-  and inquiry driven, and will provide
              mechanical engineering  students with an opportunity early in their college
              career to  investigate and practice some general principles of materials 
              science and some general concepts in manufacturing to solve a  real-world
              problem in a design project involving  press-forming/press-shaping.  The
              laboratory course will carry one  (l) credit hour with half (0.5) credit hour
              of design, and will  meet once a week for three hours. It will consist of 
              lecture/demonstration during the first 20 to 30 minutes of the  class period,
              hands-on investigation by students during the next  hour-and-a-half to two
              hours, and will conclude with a class  discussion devoted to interpreting the
              results of the investigation  and how they relate to the design project.
              Students will work in  teams of two or three.  The four basic elements of
              materials  science and engineering -- synthesis and processing, structure, 
              properties, and performance -- will be investigated by students in  laboratory
              experiments and applied in the design project.  Statistics and probability as
              they relate to product descriptions,  tolerance, and properties will be applied
              by students in the design  project. They will also practice the process of
              design for  manufacturability, tool selection, and tooth path optimization.  
              The laboratory course will be team-taught. The project will be  assessed by
              tracking the progress of students who are enrolled in  the proposed course as
              they move forward in the engineering  curriculum. Results of the project will
              be disseminated by paper  presentations in regional and national conference,
              and published in  journals.
