Abstract    :

              this proposal envisions the introduction of modern  technology into the General
              Biology and Microbiology laboratories  in the form of horizontal agarose gel
              electrophoresis. This  technique will be used to:  1) separate and compare DNA
              fragments  resulting from digestion with different endonucleases 2) bacterial 
              transformation by uptake of exogenous DNA 3) protein  electrophoresis to
              illustrate molecular mass determination,  separation, and identification of
              proteins from different sources.   Phase II of this proposal will be to sponsor
              workshops for college  and precollege teachers in the use and implementation of
              this  technology in the laboratory.
