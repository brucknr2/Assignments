Abstract    :
              This project enables Franklin Pierce College to introduce  "Discovery Laboratory
              Exercises" to 47% of its undergraduates. Our  working definition of a
              "Discovery Laboratory", which is compatible  with Pierce's newly implemented
              interdisciplinary curriculum plan,  includes: exercises to encourage the
              induction of principles by  experiment and not merely verification; a forum for
              students to  investigate scientific processes at a level consistent with their 
              own intellectual development; experiments with instruments that  offer state of
              the art laboratory experiences to emulate the future  workplace; generating the
              excitement of discovery in science to  attract undergraduates to careers in
              science; opportunities for  both science and non-science majors to experience
              the capabilities  of technologically advanced instrumentation.  The twenty-four
               discovery laboratory exercises cited in this work will be applied  to Biology,
              Chemistry, Environmental Science, and Integrated  Science courses. These labs
              are designed to improve the scientific  and technological literacy of both the
              science and non-science  major students and to convey that the study of science
              is an active  process - not a reactive one.
