Abstract    :
              9451581  Bush  We are introducing a laser spectroscopy laboratory course in 
              Physical Chemistry in order to improve the chemistry curriculum and  thereby
              significantly enhance the education and training of  virtually all of our
              graduates.  The equipment for laboratory  improvement has been selected to
              maximize the number and variety of  experiments that may be carried out in the
              course, and students are  also developing undergraduate research projects which
              can be  pursued using the same equipment.
