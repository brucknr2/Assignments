Abstract    :
              9451643  Lowe  Alabama A&M University, an HBCU in Huntsville, Alabama, will 
              develop a new approach to teaching modern optics. The central parts  of the
              program are laboratory courses for undergraduates in  holography (first
              semester) and fiber optic communication (second  semester). The last part of
              these courses will stress preparation  and rehearsal for our undergraduate
              students to teach the subject  to 11-12th grade students and college freshman
              at "Alabama Space  Camp,"  which will reach roughly 2000 highly select and
              highly  motivated students.  Payoffs include motivating young black science 
              and engineering students to get involved in an area at the  forefront of
              research and development; doing outreach to 2000  precollege students; and
              testing of a new approach to teaching  science to undergraduates.
