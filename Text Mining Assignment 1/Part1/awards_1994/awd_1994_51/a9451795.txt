Abstract    :
              9451795  Lion  A laboratory has been developed to support hands-on student 
              experimentation with current aspects of environmental engineering.  The focus
              is on providing a context for the use of modern  analytical tools and
              instrumentation by addressing current  environmental problem areas such as:
              assessment and remediation of  contaminated soil and groundwater; lake
              acidification; oxygen sag;  biological wastewater treatment; removal of mixed
              wastes from soil;  water removal from sludge; biodegradation in landfills; and 
              pollutant mixing in river flow. Laboratory exercises reflect recent  and
              ongoing research of the Cornell faculty in Environmental  Engineering. This
              focus on current environmental problems,  facilitated with modern analytical
              tools, allows participating  students to experience the excitement and
              challenge of a  dynamically evolving field.
