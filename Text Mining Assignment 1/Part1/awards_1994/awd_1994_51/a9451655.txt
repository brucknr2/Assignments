Abstract    :
              9451655  Melendez                             A 200 MHz FT-NMR with
              multi-nuclear and variable temperature  capabilities is being acquired to
              provide students of chemistry,  biology and health-related fields with
              opportunities to become  proficient in theory, operation and application of
              contemporary NMR  spectroscopy.  Innovative experiments including 1D and 2D
              (13C, 1H)  NMR techniques are being incorporated into the chemistry curriculum 
              in a stepwise approach beginning with the introductory Organic  Chemistry
              Course. Students in the other courses affected,  Spectroscopy, Organic
              Synthesis, Physical Chemistry, Inorganic  Chemistry, Biochemistry, then apply
              more advanced NMR techniques to  learn: structure elucidation of complex
              organic molecules and  organometallic complexes, determination of kinetic and 
              thermodynamic parameters, determination of substrate specificity  and
              stereoselectivity of enzymes, and other principles or  techniques, as well.
              Also, the diversity and range of current and  future student research projects
              is being enhanced through new  capabilities for multinuclear- and variable
              temperature NMR  applications.
