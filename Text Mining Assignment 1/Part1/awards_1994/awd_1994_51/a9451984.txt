Abstract    :
              9451984  Walters                                                    A computer
              laboratory at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga  allows the Department
              of Mathematics to increase substantially  student use of mathematical software
              in a variety of courses. The  lab is being used in single and multi-variable
              calculus to support  the work being done in calculus reform, using, adapting,
              and  enhancing the Ostebee and Zorn materials.  The other primary uses  of the
              lab are in Linear Algebra, expanding upon the ATLAST  materials, and in two
              upper division courses, Discrete Mathematics  and Graph Theory and
              Combinatorics.  The lab is used by students  during some regular class meetings
              and outside of class time for  longer projects.  The use of the lab enhances
              current curricular  efforts and offers the possibility of publishing the
              results  together with new teaching materials.  The revision of courses for 
              the use of the lab builds upon the work of several faculty members  who are
              actively
