Abstract    :
              9451116  Bieber                                                    The major
              goals of the project are to develop and perfect a number  of NMR and molecular
              modeling experiments that are suitable for  integration into the undergraduate
              chemistry curriculum. An NMR and  molecular modeling software will be
              purchased. Several excellent  NMR experiments have been designed and tested by
              faculty for the  biophysical, inorganic, organic and physical chemistry 
              laboratories. and more than a dozen undergraduate students are  engaged in
              research projects that use NMR. Funding the proposed  project will allow
              faculty to develop additional NMR experiments  for undergraduate courses, will
              expose all majors and many non-  majors to NMR, and will permit students to
              apply powerful molecular  modelling tools to chemical problems. The project
              will make it  feasible for other institutions which lack NMR instrumentation to
               carry out NMR data analyses and molecular modelling studies at  modest cost,
              because NMR data, processing macros and documentation  will be available from
              Arizona State University through electronic  communication or in tape formats.
              By using electronic networks, the  impact of the project will extend well
              beyond undergraduate  instruction at Arizona State University.
