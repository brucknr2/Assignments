Abstract    :
              9451674  Spratt  William Woods College for Women (WWC) is a 120-year-old private
               liberal arts college located in mid-Missouri. This proposal  requests a
              $51,056 grant, to be matched by an equal contribution  from the college, to
              purchase equipment for the undergraduate  biology laboratory. The proposal
              responds to a dual need. First,  scientific advances in the field of biology
              are proceeding at a  rate that has outstripped the ability of many institutions
              to keep  pace, especially small, rural colleges in the Midwest.  Particularly,
              these schools are deficient in delivering  state-of-the-art concepts of DNA,
              cellular and molecular biology.  Second, for the past seven years, William
              Woods students have been  sent to neighboring Westminster College (formerly all
              male) for  math/science courses, conveying the message to students that math 
              and science are "male fields". Under a new administration, the  college has
              been working to return a strong math/science presence  to campus and has
              committed substantial resources toward this end,  including employing a
              tenure-track full-time biology faculty member  and restoring a biology
              laboratory. This proposal requests NSF  support for equipment that will enable
              the college to (1) develop  an upper level cellular and molecular biology
              course to be taught  on the WWC campus for both William Woods and Westminster
              students  and (2) develop a DNA module for insertion into WWC's reinstated 
              General Biology I lecture and laboratory courses. Through a  dissemination
              workshop at WWC, the curricular materials developed  for these courses will be
              shared with area college and high-school  faculty.
