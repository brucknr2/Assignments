Abstract    :
              9451940  Galloway  This project builds on established success in
              laboratory-based  undergraduate education with an innovative curriculum of
              training  in skeletal analysis, exploiting faculty strengths in this area and 
              potentially bringing high proportions of women and minorities into  careers in
              archaeology, biological anthropology, and related  fields. Advanced teaching
              materials, computer hardware, and  software are being incorporated into new
              anthropology teaching  laboratories and now offer undergraduates facilities
              where they can  learn highly transferable techniques, including osteometrics, 
              bioelectrical impedence technology and multimedia packages to study  functional
              anatomy. The curriculum development plan also features  1) "enrichment
              laboratories" offered in tandem with large lower  division lecture courses, 2)
              intensive exposure to science research  practices, and 3) independent research
              under faculty supervision.
