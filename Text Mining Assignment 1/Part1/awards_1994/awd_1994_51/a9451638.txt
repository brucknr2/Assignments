Abstract    :
              9451638  Dickstein                                                 The biology
              laboratory implements a hands-on component of a  required biology course for
              first-year engineering students.   The goal is to impart basic biological
              concepts to future  engineers, many of whom will be working in fields having a 
              biological, biomedical, or environmental impact. The course and  laboratory
              focus on the concepts behind molecular biology,  biotechnology, and
              environmental biology. Laboratory experiments  demonstrate the concepts of
              enzymatic specificity, in vitro  manipulation of DNA, growth of a microbial
              population, recombinant  DNA, and gene regulation.
