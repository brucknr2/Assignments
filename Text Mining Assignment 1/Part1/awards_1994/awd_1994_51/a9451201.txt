Abstract    :
              The aim of this project is to provide upgraded and innovative  computing
              capabilities for courses in electrical engineering. Plans  have been made to
              establish a high- speed fiber optic backbone for  all departments. One high-
              speed workstation, in a cluster  environment, is being provided for each
              department. A few smaller  workstations (four per department, and 20 for the
              entire College)  are being located around each high speed workstation in each 
              department. These workstations  handle some computing locally, but,  if the
              load increases, jobs will be submitted to the cluster.  The  addition of
              industrial-type workstations permits: courses in  computer communications,
              numerical methods, etc. to be enhanced;  students and faculty to have access to
              image processing, data  visualization, parallel processing, computer networking
              and  multimedia document processing. Students are being provided with  access
              to the Internet and a Unix operating system environment.  Also, faculty and
              students have access to updated and upgraded  systems which support innovative
              senior projects and research.
