Abstract    :
              9451698  Grimes                                                    A major
              challenge of Colleges and Universities is to teach the  "process of science" to
              undergraduates. The best way to learn  science is to do it. For this, one needs
              curiosity, questions,  hypotheses and some tools. To provide these components
              to our  undergraduates, we propose a course "Methods in Modern Biology,"  that
              will be team taught by cell, molecular, developmental, and  evolutionary
              biologists. This course will teach students how to ask  rational scientific
              questions, search for solutions, and find the  answers to those questions using
              a wide variety of techniques. An  SEM is essential in our plan because it will
              provide: 1. a link  between molecular and evolutionary processes with complex 
              morphologies; 2. an effective demonstration of the complementarity  of
              techniques; and 3. a graphic, easily achieved, and often  beautiful product
              that provides a sense of accomplishment,  satisfaction, and excitement for
              students. To encourage information  exchange among undergraduates, we will
              establish an electronic mail  network and newsgroup (SEMLAB). Using SEMLAB,
              students at Hofstra  can exchange reciprocally ideas, problems, solutions,
              techniques,  etc. with students and faculty at other internet nodes. SEMLAB 
              should stimulate the interests of our students, because they  actually will
              become members of the "scientific community."
