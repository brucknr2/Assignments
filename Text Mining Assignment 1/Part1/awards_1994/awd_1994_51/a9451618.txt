Abstract    :
              9451618  Sloane  An integrated laboratory is developed in which modeling, 
              simulating, and real-time testing are all performed through a  common MATLAB
              Simulink graphical interface. This laboratory is used  in a wide range of
              courses, from the first-year cross-disciplinary  Exploring Engineering course
              to fourth-year senior design projects.  This laboratory provides an integrated
              environment for analysis,  design, simulation, word-processing, and
              measurement, in a novel  extension to conventional real-time digital signal
              processing.  Students use the same environment to simulate the system as well
              as  measure data, so inconsistencies between simulations and  measurements can
              be identified and corrected during the lab period,  which facilitates learning.
              The new system is used for nonlinear  control of an induction motor,
              characterization of electronic  devices, testing of digital circuits, digital
              filtering, and robot  control.
