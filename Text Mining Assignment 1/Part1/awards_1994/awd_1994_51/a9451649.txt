Abstract    :
              9451649  Wallace                                                   We are
              implementing a multi-media approach to learning that  stresses problem solving
              with visual techniques, intuitive  exploration, drill and practice exercises
              and develops strong  computational skills.  We are developing the Computing
              Laboratory  for Undergraduate Education (CLUE) to facilitate: (1) visualization
               and intuitive exploration of Earth processes through computer  modeling and
              simulations; (2) development of student computational  skills by further
              integrating computer applications into the  geoscience curriculum; and (3)
              reinforcement of classroom  instruction with faculty sponsored research
              experiences.  Our  project represents a major change in the style of teaching
              both  geosciences and computational skills and places a strong emphasis  on
              research experiences to reinforce those skills.  We have  embarked on a three
              prong approach to realize our goals. In a  preliminary project, on which our
              current, expanded project is  based, we have: (1) developed and are teaching a
              modular computer  skills course designed especially for geoscience majors, (2) 
              implemented curriculum changes that integrate computer technology  throughout
              our undergraduate curriculum, and (3) developed and  taught a research methods
              course that actively involves  undergraduate students in research labs and
              develops the  organizational, communication and computational skills required
              to  perform research.
