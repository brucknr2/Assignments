Abstract    :
              9451005  Tsai                                                          An
              intensive laboratory course for undergraduates in advanced  techniques of
              biochemistry and molecular biology  -Advanced  Biochemistry and Molecular
              Biology Laboratory (Chem 5362)-is a  senior level course, required by the new
              Bachelor of Science  program in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. A key
              feature of the  lab is that the students perform all procedures themselves
              without  involving any "demonstration" exercises. Exercises used will  include
              state-of-the-art techniques that the students are likely to  encounter later in
              their careers in this field. These include  computer-assisted DNA sequence
              analysis, polymerase chain reaction  (PCR), DNA electroporation, homologous
              recombination, in vitro  mutagenesis, reporter gene fusions, production of
              eukaryotic  proteins in E. coli, automated low pressure liquid chromatography, 
              and high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) of biological  molecules. A
              "hands-on" experience with techniques such as these  gives students a
              competitive edge in their future endeavors.
