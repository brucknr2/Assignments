Abstract    :
              This project will add the important field of cellular  neurophysiology to an
              undergraduate laboratory. Using invertebrate  preparations, students will do
              hands-on experiments and exercises  while learning modern equipment and
              techniques. Four student  workstations will be equipped with microscopes,
              intra- and  extra-cellular amplifiers, stimulators, oscilloscopes and 
              computers. The students will study the physiology and morphology of  the
              innervation of the crayfish superficial flexor muscle, the  ionic basis of the
              resting potential, the excitable properties of  snail brain cells, crayfish
              neuromuscular synaptic transmission and  the stimulus-response properties of
              the crayfish stretch receptor.  This project will expose all lab students to
              hands on work which  corresponds to text work in the course as well as provide
              the  initial experience and equipment for those students wishing to  continue
              their studies on the neuroscience research team and in the  neuroscience
              concentration.
