Abstract    :
              9451274  Roberge                              We will develop a laboratory
              suitable for teaching introductory  physics in a "workshop" format, where the
              lecture, recitation, and  laboratory components of a traditional physics course
              will be  integrated into one learning environment.  The purpose of the  project
              is to assess the viability of the workshop format in a  university setting, by
              conducting a pilot program for 30 students.   If successful, the program will
              be scaled up to serve approximately  900 science and engineering students per
              year.  We will outfit a  laboratory with computers to run the Comprehensive
              Unified Physics  Learning Environment (CUPLE), a multitasking, multimedia
              learning  tool which was developed by Rensselaer and other universities.  
              CUPLE will provide (1) on-screen videos to help students set up lab 
              experiments; (2) data acquisition via video technologies and other  traditional
              transducers; (3) a variety of tools for data analysis,  visualization, and
              modeling; and (4) access via hyperlinks to  databases of text, graphical, and
              video information.  The  multimedia software and data acquisition capabilities
              of the  hardware will enable the students to work jointly on group learning 
              assignments, problem solving sessions, laboratory experiments, and  the
              preparation of oral and written presentations.  The equipment  is a vital
              component of the interactive, cooperative learning  strategy on which the
              workshop format is based.
