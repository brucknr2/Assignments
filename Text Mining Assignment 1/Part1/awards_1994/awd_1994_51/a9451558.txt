Abstract    :
              9451558  Ward                                            The aquatic science
              program at Grand Valley State University  launched the vessel D.J. ANGUS in
              1986.  The vessel supports an  extensive undergraduate aquatic science
              education program, a newly  developed educational opportunity for prospective
              elementary school  teachers, and workshops for in-service teachers.  The D.J.
              ANGUS  also supports a major informal science education initiative  spanning
              much of the east shore of Lake Michigan.  The D.J. ANGUS  promotes both formal
              and informal science education through  investigative hands-on activities.  The
              vessel was intentionally  equipped with "low tech" instruments until the
              success of the  program was documented. During the 7 years of operation the
              program  has grown to a point of maximum capacity in which approximately  3,5OO
              participants are served each year. In addition to serving a  maximum number of
              participants, the program has spread from its  original location in Grand
              Haven, Michigan, to include many other  sites along the Lake Michigan
              shoreline. The increasing requests  for the program, plus the annual surveys of
              participants, indicate  that the program has achieved success at its current
              stage of  development and is now ready to proceed to the next level.  This 
              additional instrumentation provided by this award increases both  the formal
              and informal instructional capabilities of the vessel D.  J. ANGUS. This
              equipment increases the science content, improves  the experience, and expands
              the scope of the aquatic sciences  program.
