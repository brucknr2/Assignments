Abstract    :
              9451084  Bloom                                                     This proposal
              requests funds to purchase equipment to strengthen  undergraduate labs in
              modern physics, optics and advanced lab  courses in physics at Winona State
              University.  The center piece of  the request is a combined
              monochromator/spectrograph coupled with  a 1024 pixel linear photodiode array
              detector.  A complete software  data acquisition and analysis package,
              functionally specific to the  equipment, is an integral part of the overall
              apparatus.  A request  is also being made for supporting equipment, including
              an IBM-  compatible computer, Michelson interferometer and light sources.
