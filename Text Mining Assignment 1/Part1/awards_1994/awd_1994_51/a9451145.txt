Abstract    :
              9451145  Edmunds           This project supports an upper division
              laboratory-based  physiological ecology course in the life sciences. Major
              goals are  emphasized, including a unifying of the diversity of organismic 
              adaptations with focus on energy budgets and resource acquisition;  the linking
              between genes, enzymes, proteins, organisms,  populations and the environment;
              providing hypothesis driven  laboratory exercises, experimental design and
              analysis, as well as  an introduction to contemporary instrumentation. The
              project has  expanded the laboratory component of the course, is disseminating 
              the results of the program through a laboratory manual, provides  pre-service
              and in-service teacher training workshops,  undergraduate research, and local
              scientific conferences.
