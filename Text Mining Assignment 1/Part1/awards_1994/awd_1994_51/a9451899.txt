Abstract    :
              9451899  Domber                                                             This
              project supports modern, computer-controlled operant  conditioning systems
              which enhance the program in animal behavior.  The equipment is used mainly
              with upper level undergraduates for  laboratories, classroom demonstrations,
              and independent research.  The program has various specific goals, including an
              increase of  student interest in research and technology, opportunities for
              more  advanced and creative student projects, and fostering critical  thought
              and understanding of research design. Also, student's who  have hands-on
              experience with modern equipment are better prepared  for science professions
              and for life in an increasingly  technological society.
