Abstract    :
              The Cellular and Molecular Genetics Core Laboratory is used by four 
              undergraduate Cell Biology and Genetics courses.  It is equipped  with
              electrophoretic, sequencing, and Polymerase Chain Reaction  (PCR) instruments.
              The courses effected are designed to  link  benchwork experience and the
              formulation of fundamental questions  about cellular dynamics, in order to
              improve both the critical  thinking skills and laboratory proficiency of the
              students.
