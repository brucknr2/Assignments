Abstract    :
              9451348  Thorbjarnarson  This project is providing undergraduate majors in
              hydrogeology with  hands-on, practical field and laboratory experience that is
              vital  to their future employment or graduate research.  The equipment is 
              being utilized in a new undergraduate course: Field and Laboratory  Techniques
              in Hydrogeology.  In addition, the new equipment is  being used in other
              classes and is increasing undergraduate  research opportunities.  This field
              and laboratory course is being  taught for the first time in the Spring of 1994
              and the field  component is being conducted at the new San Diego State
              University  (SDSU) well field site.  The new equipment is being included in 
              several of the field exercises of this new course.  Several  peristaltic pumps,
              a bladder pump, and a set of packers are being  used in the following
              exercises: Water Sampling, Well Purging,  Tracer Testing.  A pump, water level
              probes, pressure transducers  and a data logger are being used for the Water
              Level Measurement  and Well Pump Test exercises.  Permeameters are being used
              in the  laboratory estimation of core sample permeability, while specific  ion
              electrodes, meters and a fluorometer are being used in the  Tracer Test
              exercises.
