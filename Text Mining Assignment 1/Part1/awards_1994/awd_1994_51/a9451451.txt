Abstract    :
              9451451  Getman                                                    The project
              will purchase (1) an automated sample changer for a  Varian UNITY plus 300 MHz
              NMR spectrometer, (2) ten Macintosh  computers, and (3) software. The purpose
              of this equipment  acquisition is to expose a large number of students, from
              freshman  through senior levels, to NMR instrumentation and the capabilities 
              of the instrumental technique. The proposed program will expose  students in a
              stepwise fashion to increasingly more complex NMR  concepts and techniques over
              four academic years. In the freshman  laboratory course, students (400
              annually) will be introduced to  the qualitative and quantitative application
              of NMR spectroscopy.  During the sophomore level organic laboratory course,
              students  (approximately 175 annually) will employ proton NMR spectroscopy  for
              routine structural analysis. The junior level advanced organic  laboratory
              course will introduce students ( approximately 20  annually) to the use of
              carbon- 13, 2-dimensional and more advanced  NMR techniques. Finally, the
              senior level inorganic laboratory  course will introduce students to more
              advanced NMR theory and NMR  spectra of quadrupolar nuclei, as well as build
              upon the students'  previous experience with 2-dimensional NMR techniques. In
              short,  the Varian UNlTYplus spectrometer, when connected to the Macintosh 
              computers and equipped with an automated sample changer, will serve  as the
              instrumental cornerstone for a program designed to  systematically educate
              science and engineering students in the  concepts and applications of NMR
              spectroscopy.
