Abstract    :
              9451645  McDaniel                                                  This project
              involves electronic multi-media classrooms and  laboratories designed to
              incorporate technology into undergraduate  instruction in the social sciences.
              Faculty members as well are  being trained in multi-media course work
              development to enable them  to provide innovative instruction to students at
              the institution.  The facilities are curriculum integrated, multi-faceted, and 
              central to the institution where a variety of learning experiences  take place
              in an inviting environment. Laboratory instructors also  play pivotal roles by
              providing services and integrated learning  experiences for undergraduate
              students. The electronic classroom  facilities consist of multi-media
              work-stations connected in a PC  local area network. Each multi-media
              work-station, with the  required hardware, has graphics, sound, animation, and
              hypertext  capabilities to enhance applications and are developed to 
              accommodate student learning needs.
