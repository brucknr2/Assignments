Abstract    :
              9451213  Leger  A unique senior photonics laboratory is developed that combines
              the  resources and talents of the University of Minnesota with those of  local
              industry. Formal laboratory education takes place both at the  university and
              at selected industrial laboratories, giving the  students first-hand experience
              with sophisticated equipment and  real-world problems. In addition, the
              university laboratories are  designed to take advantage of industrial expertise
              and materials,  and to give students exposure in areas important to industry.
              The  laboratory includes a state-of-the-art coherent imaging and  measurement
              system, and a fundamental experimental testbed for a  series of experiments in
              fiber and integrated optics.
