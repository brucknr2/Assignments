Abstract    :
              9451050  Breen                                The following proposal requests
              funds to purchase a high  performance capillary electrophoresis (CE) system.
              Such a system  would permit this exciting new development in separation science
               and chemical analysis to be incorporated into our undergraduate  chemistry
              curriculum through a defined set of laboratory  experiments. As designed, these
              experiments will impact our  Analytical and Biological chemistry laboratories
              in a way likely to  provide a model used by other institutions. Our plan of
              development  includes:  an introduction to CE principles and methodologies in
              both  laboratory experiences;  the development of experiments which demonstrate
              the micellar  electrokinetic chromatographic mode for the separation of neutral
               molecules and the effects of chiral selectors for the separation of 
              enantiomers in our Analytical Laboratories;  an emphasis in the Biological
              Chemistry Laboratory on capillary gel  electrophoresis as applied to the
              separation of proteins and  nucleic acids and as a biophysical tool to assist
              in measuring the  interactions between biological macromolecules.  The
              requested instrument will have a significant impact on the  training of our
              students and will provide cutting-edge educational  opportunities that do not
              currently exist in our undergraduate  curriculum.
