Abstract    :
              9451043  Short                                This project concerns the design
              and development of a required  undergraduate materials laboratory course.  The
              course will serve  as a corequisite to the presently offered materials science
              course.  Therefore, the Department of Mechanical Engineering curriculum will 
              be strengthened by changing its materials science course from a  lecture-only
              mode to a lecture-laboratory mode. The course will  emphasize the
              processing-structure-properties-performance  relationship of materials in
              engineering.  Approximately 30-40  students per semester will be affected.
