Abstract    :
              9451653  Tankersley                                                A
              comprehensive computer-based multimedia resource center is  used  extensively
              in laboratory courses for both science majors and non-  majors.  The networked
              facility, consisting student multimedia  workstations (Apple Macintosh Quadra
              660av computers) attached to  an Apple Workgroup Server 95, supports a variety
              of interactive  laboratory exercises that emphasize learner-centered
              instruction,  small-group interaction, and critical thinking.  The most 
              innovative application of the proposed facility involves student  use of
              multimedia authoring software to create "electronic term-  papers" that combine
              text, graphics, color images, full motion  video, animation, and sound to
              produce digital reports which become  part of an interactive library and
              database.  Students enrolled in  the Department's non-major course entitled
              "Human Ecology" use  authoring software to organize and develop documentaries
              on  environmental and conservation issues affecting the Pacific  Northwest. 
              The same multimedia software is used by science majors  taking Comparative
              Physiology to design and develop visual  simulations and animations of
              physiological processes.
