Abstract    :
              9451642  Grodzinsky                                                Undergraduate
              electrical and computer engineering students often  study electronic systems as
              being either analog or digital in  nature. This does not match the industrial
              reality where virtually  all systems have both analog and digital subsystems.
              It is the  purpose of this project to provide this experience by creating a 
              new capstone electronics laboratory which emphasizes "mixed signal" 
              engineering. Ten experiment stations that include a 486 PC  platform, on which
              the design and simulation tools will run, and a  modular plug-in box are being
              established. The digital subsystem is  being implemented with a field
              programmable gate array (FPGA).  Analog subsystems are being designed on PC
              cards which  plug into  the modular box containing the FPGA and its socket,
              power supply  and connectors. This configuration helps to reduce the circuit 
              construction time and allows the student to concentrate on  electronic design,
              circuit simulation and debugging.
