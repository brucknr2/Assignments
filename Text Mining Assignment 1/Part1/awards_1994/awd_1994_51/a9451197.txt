Abstract    :
              Geography undergraduate students in this project are becoming  immersed in the
              scientific aspects of this discipline through a  pedagogic atmosphere of
              cooperative learning and real-time  communication. They engage in active
              learning through  computer-aided instruction offered by a Virtual Communication
              and  Spatial Analysis Laboratory (VC-Sal) program. The VC-Sal project  also
              emphasizes certain major themes. These include animate  geography,
              undergraduate communication and mentoring relationships  using cooperative
              on-line learning, and exposing undergraduates to  current professional and
              scientific applications of geography.  There is integration of targeted
              undergraduate course projects with  existing departmental research, and it is
              expected that the project  will spur non-majors to attain an understanding of
              the basic  principles and methods of science.
