Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry and Physics purchasing of a 300 MHz  Fourier
              Transform nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer. The  applications of NMR is
              being integrated throughout the curriculum  with increasingly sophisticated 
              techniques as the student  progresses through the program's course sequence. 
              Beginning with  exposure to C-13 NMR in general chemistry the experience builds
              to  investigation of temperature dependent fluxional behavior of 
              organometallics and 2-dimensional techniques in biochemistry and  advanced
              organic chemistry.  The instrument is also enhancing an  active undergraduate
              research program.
