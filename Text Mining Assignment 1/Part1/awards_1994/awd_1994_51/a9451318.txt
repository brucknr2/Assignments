Abstract    :
              9451318  Tullis                               The California State University
              (CSU) computer networking system  gives students access to science education
              resources. Undergraduate  science courses on our campus, as well as other
              sites, will be  accessed via the network to a scanning electron microscope
              (SEM)  equipped with an X-ray micro analyzer and a digital imaging system. 
              This instrumentation will be used to teach structure/function  relationships to
              biology students and structure/process  relationships to geology and chemistry
              students. We will use  teaching methods that will incorporate interactive,
              hands-on  curricular units designed to promote inquiry through observation  and
              experimental design while providing the means to manipulate and  view
              microscopic objects. Specific laboratory units based on SEM  image capture
              followed by analysis and interpretation will be  incorporated into major and
              general education courses and student  research projects. This concept can be
              applied to any PC operated  scientific instrumentation. The results of this
              project will be   disseminated through a variety of means that reach a large
              audience  throughout the California State University system and     local 
              community schools.
