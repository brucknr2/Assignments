Abstract    :
              9451753  Kopec  The project is developing a multimedia laboratory for students
              in  several introductory science classes. These laboratories are being  used to
              provide tutorial assistance and to provide simulated  laboratory experience for
              these classes. The project is being  accomplished in two phases. In the first
              phase, commercially  available software is being used for the tutorials and
              simulated  laboratories. In the second phase, tutorials and laboratories are 
              being developed to more completely meet the needs of the students  in these
              courses.
