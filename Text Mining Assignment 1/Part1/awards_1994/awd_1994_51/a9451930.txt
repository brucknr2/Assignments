Abstract    :
              A feature of this project is a three-phased introduction to the use  of scanning
              electron microscopy (SEM) as part of the biology  curriculum. The educational
              goal of this program is conceptual  orientation to the microscopic world. 
              Majors and non-majors in  introductory courses in biology and earth science
              first observe  demonstrations then participate in instructor-led small group 
              projects leading to hands on operation using automatic modes of the  SEM. They
              study experimental laboratory materials which they have  prepared for SEM.
              Emphasis at this stage is on preparation of  materials and presentation of
              results in the form of photographs,  slides, or videotapes. At an intermediate
              level more detailed  instruction in the theory and technique of SEM is taught
              initially  as part of the Biological Techniques, Microbiology, Plant Biology 
              II and Parasitology courses. The use of SEM at the undergraduate  level extends
              students' abilities to conduct undergraduate research  projects.
