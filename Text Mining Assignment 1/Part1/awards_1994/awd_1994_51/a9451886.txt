Abstract    :
              9451886  Vandiver             This project is designed to establish an
              observational  filming/coding laboratory as a component of undergraduate 
              instruction and research.  Students are trained in this area and  become
              involved actively with research in both classroom and  laboratory situations.
              They also have the option of incorporating  independent research investigations
              into their undergraduate  studies. Specific courses include Experimental
              Psychology, Child  Psychology, and Human Growth and Development. The project
              also  allows students enrolled in Psychology Honors Thesis and  Independent
              Research courses to conduct original behavioral  observation research and
              analyze their findings more effectively.  It is expected that the project will
              also add a real-life research  methodology into the curriculum and, combined
              with a computer  laboratory already accessible to students, will give students
              a  unique and sophisticated background in research methods in  psychology.
