Abstract    :
              9451763  Chelberg  This project is intended to improve the laboratory experience
              for  Augsburg College biology majors in the study of cell biology.  Students
              will gain an appreciation of the relationships between  intact cells,
              functioning cell organelles, and their components  through investigations
              designed to improve both their thinking  skills and their laboratory skills.
              Effects of the project will be  felt in lab exercises and student projects in
              introductory and  advanced cell biology courses and in independent student
              research.  A rapid cycling ultracentrifuge, a multipurpose preparative 
              centrifuge, electrophoretic equipment and a refrigerated water bath  will be
              used for separation and analysis of subcellular components.  For colorimetric
              and spectrophotometric analysis of mitochondrial  function, vacuolar proton
              pumping, nucleic acid and protein  determinations and a variety of related
              procedures we propose to  acquire six student grade spectrophotometers and a
              versatile high  quality spectrophotometer with plotting and analytical
              capability.  Students will use a very sensitive pH meter and a "cool" high 
              intensity light source to monitor pH changes as isolated  chloroplasts pump
              protons in the light reactions of photosynthesis.  All our planned improvements
              are designed to give our students  experience in framing questions in cell
              biology and then learning  how these may, and may not, be answered with modern
              analytical  tools.
