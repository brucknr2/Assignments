Abstract    :
              9451430  Levin  This is a joint project by the Departments of Political Science
              and  Sociology at the institution. Together, the departments teach about  2500
              students per semester of whom 60 percent are from populations  underrepresented
              in science. Networked microcomputers and current  technology and software are
              used. The project is directed at  expanding the use of the computational
              laboratories beyond  statistics and methods courses to include the entire
              curriculum.  Also, undergraduates are strongly encouraged to engage in
              original,  empirical research. Determined efforts are also being made to 
              convince populations underrepresented in science of the utility of  these
              materials and technology for understanding and developing in  the social
              sciences.
