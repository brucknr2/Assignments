Abstract    :
              9451300  Slater  The proposed project addresses the use of electrohydraulic test
               stands to educate undergraduate engineers in the area of controls, 
              instrumentation, and fluid power. The test stands will allow  students to
              quantitatively evaluate design changes relative to  system performance on a
              real-time basis. Total system response  including transient and steady state
              can be monitored and analyzed.    This integrated, interdisciplinary approach
              provides the student  with an exposure to computer-aided design/analysis
              methods for  real-time electrohydraulic control system design. In parallel, 
              software-based simulation methods will be used to develop models  which can be
              verified in the laboratory. Direct verification of  principles provides
              reinforcement and builds student confidence.  Structured methods of logical
              system design and diagnostic  identification provide students with valuable
              experience for use in  open-ended industrial design projects, which culminate
              the senior  year. This problem solving/project experience and computer 
              design/analysis skills are important capabilities required in  today's global
              economy. The proposed project is innovative in that  the use of
              electrohydraulic technology for undergraduate  instruction in controls requires
              an interdisciplinary approach  using fluid power, electronics and computers as
              opposed to teaching  control systems within a single discipline such as
              electrical,  pneumatic, mechanical, etc.    Dissemination of the results will
              be through seminars open to both  academia and industry. Past history has shown
              this to be an  effective method for dissemination and adoption of the methods 
              employed in undergraduate education and industrial instruction.
