Abstract    :
              9451794  Knispel                                                             To
              augment an upper-division instrumentation course, the University  of Wisconsin
              Oshkosh will purchase three microcomputers with  laboratory software, data
              acquisition cards, IEEE-488 interfaces,  digital signal processing cards,
              frequency meters, and analog  signal conditioning circuitry for thermocouple,
              flow meter and  accelerometer use.  This laboratory will serve both physics
              majors  and computer science majors electing the emphasis in electronics  and
              instrumentation.  The equipment will also enhance an advanced  experimental
              physics course, a senior design project, and a  computer science practicum. 
              Central to the project is the  development of experiments where multiple
              channels of data can be  collected, processed, analyzed, plotted and the
              results compared to  predictions made from numerical solution of the applicable
              boundary  value problems.  Examples of such experiments include the  vibrations
              of a plate, fluid flow past an obstruction, and  temperature distributions or
              heat flow in a plate.
