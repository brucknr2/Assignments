Abstract    :
              9451414  Wilson  This project modernizes the physics program at the University
              of  Central Oklahoma by introducing a computational physics component  into the
              curriculum designed for majors in physics, pre-  engineering, and other
              sciences.  This is accomplished by (1)  integrating the methodology and tools
              of computational physics into  the traditional physics laboratories and courses
              rather than adding  new courses into the already full undergraduate curriculum,
              (2)  adopting a progressive, developmental use and expected proficiency  with
              computational physics as the student increases in  sophistication throughout
              the undergraduate program, and (3)  incorporating scientific visualization
              throughout the undergraduate  program to illustrate and simplify complex
              physics concepts.
