Abstract    :
              9451000  Arvanitis                                                 The project
              is intended to provide Trenton State College's  undergraduate chemistry majors
              (and also biology majors) with  experience in using a 300 MHz FT NMR
              spectrometer.  An integrated  instructional approach is planned which begins
              with the  introduction of simple NMR techniques in the sophomore level  organic
              chemistry laboratory. The instrument will also receive  extensive use in
              advanced elective courses which require physical  chemistry as a prerequisite.
              The desire for faculty to include an  experimental NMR component in organic
              chemistry courses is readily  understood and there is a growing trend to do so.
              The role that an  NMR can play in undergraduate education in the areas of
              inorganic  chemistry and biochemistry has not been explored to the same 
              extent. Several new experiments have been designed for these  particular
              courses that are unique and would be of interest to  other colleges and
              universities. The instrument will also receive  a great deal of use in our
              undergraduate research program. The  excitement generated by a new
              sophisticated spectrometer will  inspire more students to become involved in
              research projects and  to pursue graduate studies in chemistry. The NMR
              training that the  program will provide will dramatically improve the
              preparation of  graduates for immediate employment in chemical industries.
