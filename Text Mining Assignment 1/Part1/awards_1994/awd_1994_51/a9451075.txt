Abstract    :
              9451075  Lubin  The Remote Access Astronomy Project is a unique program designed
              to  foster scientific interest through the use of astronomical (and  other)
              image processing. Developed over the past five years, it is  now operational
              and in use by our upper division physics students  as well as by numerous other
              schools including community colleges  and secondary schools. We propose to
              expand the program so that our  numerous introductory Astronomy I and II
              students can take  advantage of this program.
