Abstract    :
              9451987  John                                 Each of the six regional colleges
              of the Houston Community College  System is acquiring a Fourier transform
              infrared spectrophotometers  for hands-on use by over 3,900 students annually
              enrolling in  chemistry. The instrumentation is enabling the institution to: 
              (a) utilize infrared spectroscopy in the organic chemistry  laboratories and
              facilitating the development of microscale organic  experiments;  (b)
              incorporate infrared spectroscopy in special projects for  students
              participating in the Honors program;  (c) to introduce modern instrumentation
              to first year students  through experiments involving identification by
              infrared  spectroscopy.
