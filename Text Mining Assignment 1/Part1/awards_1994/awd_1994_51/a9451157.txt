              multidisciplinary social science computer laboratory links a  local area
              network of microcomputer workstations to a campus-wide  network of computer
              resources. The network has linkages to Internet  and provides extensive storage
              capacities. The project gives  undergraduates social science databases for
              independent  undergraduate research projects. CD-ROM data resources through
              each  workstation further widen educational opportunities in the  laboratory.
              The facility also has dynamic, interactive statistical  and simulation
              applications, and includes elementary geographical  information systems.
