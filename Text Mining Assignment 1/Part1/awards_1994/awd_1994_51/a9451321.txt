Abstract    :
              9451321  Seeber  The goal of this project is to provide students with a broad
              array  of experiences and learning activities that will prepare them for 
              employment in the Fiber Optics field. One of the basic  characteristics of
              technical education curricula is its ability to  respond to rapidly changing
              technology. New developments must be  incorporated into the curriculum so that
              graduates of these  programs can compete for jobs and meet not only the present
              needs  but also the future needs of their employers.  Key to this success  is
              the acquisition of equipment for the development of a long  wavelength (850 to
              1550 nm) fiber-optic advanced laboratory for  communication and power
              transmission. Long fiber-optic wavelengths  are extremely important to study
              because of recent discoveries and  advances made in fiber-optic communications.
              The long fiber-optic  equipment in the near infra-red range and beyond will
              permit  students to make comparisons to other popular wavelengths now in  use. 
              The development of a long wavelength advanced fiber-optic  laboratory will
              assure that fiber-optic graduates will be properly  prepared for immediate
              employment now and in the foreseeable  future.  Long wave fiber-optic systems
              are now being studied by a  number of universities and communications
              industries, i.e. A.T. &  T., for the development of a global highway.
