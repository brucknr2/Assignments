Abstract    :
              9451921  Edvenson  Moorhead State University and Concordia College will purchase
              a  medium-field multinuclear NMR spectrometer and supporting hardware  and
              software to implement a network which to be called NMRnet. The  networked
              spectrometer will be used by both institutions to  introduce improved NMR
              experiments and techniques into their  organic and upper division chemistry
              courses and to support ongoing  undergraduate research. The NMRnet will allow
              students at both  institutions to use personal computers to work-up files
              exported  from the NMR console, thereby achieving a high efficiency of 
              spectrometer use and enabling all organic laboratory students (140  in the fall
              quarter/semester) to obtain weekly experimental  spectra. Students will acquire
              their own first spectra with faculty  supervision, however, student technicians
              will normally operate the  NMR spectrometer for the routine organic samples. In
              upper division  courses, students will independently control the NMR experiment
              so  that they can more fully understand the NMR technique. The 
              interinstitutional effort will allow both departments to achieve  curricular
              goals while still maintaining departmental autonomy and  will provide cost
              savings in equipment purchase and on-going  operational costs. Last, the NMRnet
              should be the first of a number  of cooperative instrumental projects for the
              institutions.
