Abstract    :
              9451257  Gibson  We request funding to purchase and establish an earth station
              for  receiving high resolution images from the environmental satellites.  The
              station would be used in several areas of the sciences  (initially physics and
              ecology) and at several levels, from  introductory classes to undergraduate
              research. It would also be  used in an outreach research program for secondary
              teachers and  students.  Science Classes. Initially we would use the station in
               PHY 220 Modern Physics and BIO 402 Ecology, where the physics  students would
              collect images from the satellites and use them to  prepare information
              products for the ecology students. The ecology  students would then do two
              projects: a meteorology project, where  they would obtain Lake Michigan surface
              water temperatures from the  satellite infra red images and ground-truth them
              against buoy data,  and a vegetation project, where they would use NDVI
              (Normalized  Difference Vegetation Index) techniques to follow changing 
              vegetation patterns in the state of Michigan during the fall by  assessing
              chlorophyll changes.  Undergraduate Research. We would  develop undergraduate
              research projects in both biology and  physics, taking advantage of the very
              large range of possibilities  inherent in the multi-spectral HRPT and VISSR
              images.  Outreach. We  would use the satellite receiving station in an outreach
              program to  involve secondary school teachers and students in accessible 
              research activities with the high resolution images. We have a  record of
              success with this type of research involvement with the  high school teachers
              and their students.
