Abstract    :
              9451790  Bondeson                                                  A new
              computational laboratory within the Department of Chemistry  is being equipped
              in order to allow students to perform molecular  modeling experiments, to
              tackle complex mathematical problems  describing real systems, and to observe
              protein dynamics of  biomolecules.  The laboratory centers on the speed and
              versatility  of computer workstations and powerful software for modeling actual
               chemical systems.  Rather than creating a new course, we are  incorporating
              modeling into several existing courses, beginning  with introductory chemistry
              for science majors.  Our intent is to  increase general retention in science
              and particular interest in  chemistry.  Students are becoming more and more
              familiar with the  sophisticated software as they progress through their
              educational  careers and are developing a high degree of proficiency and 
              independence in the use of the laboratory.  Students are using this  laboratory
              both in guided exercises and in self-paced and more  independent projects. 
              Questions of "What if...?" and "How  come...?" are posed and addressed once the
              student appreciates the  power as well as the limitations of computational
              approaches.  We  feel strongly that these tools for investigation are allowing
              our  chemistry majors to develop their creativity by relieving some of  the
              mathematical barriers and giving them a ready environment to  test their own
              ideas.  In this way, our students are being better  prepared both for careers
              in industry and also for graduate school  as they look to the future.
