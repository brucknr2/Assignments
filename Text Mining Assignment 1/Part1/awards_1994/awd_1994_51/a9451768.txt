Abstract    :
              This project involves a computer laboratory for interactive  learning in
              undergraduate geography and geology. Courses are also  an integral part of an
              environmental science program at the  institution. An electronic classroom
              consists of microcomputers and  computer display equipment that is used for
              interactive lectures,  demonstrations, and as part of geography and geology
              laboratory  exercises. Courses and exercises include meteorology, cartography, 
              computer mapping, imaging interpretation,  remote sensing, GIS,  field
              techniques, plate tectonics and geophysics. The laboratory  itself is improving
              teaching effectiveness and provides students  hands-on experiences in
              geo-processing technology. Collectively,  the project integrates a computer
              learning facility and courses  that prepare students to function in a
              problem-solving environment.
