Abstract    :
              9451862  Bass                                                      The goal of
              this project is to bring important analytical tools in  contemporary chemistry,
              medium-performance liquid chromatography  (MPLC), flash chromatography, and
              high-performance liquid  chromatography (HPLC), into the two-semester organic
              chemistry and  two one-semester advanced organic chemistry courses. MPLC will
              also  be used in the general science laboratories for the separation of 
              "real-life" samples to make the course more realistic and exciting  to the
              students.  Liquid chromatography will be introduced  progressively in the four
              organic chemistry courses, so that  students will gain experience with a
              variety of chromatographic  techniques. Experiments will be developed that use
              MPLC, HPLC, and  flash chromatography within the context of organic chemistry
              where  few undergraduate experiments have been published that use MPLC,  HPLC,
              or flash chromatography.  The instructional experiments, many  of which will
              originate in the department, should be of interest to  others.
