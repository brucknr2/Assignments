Abstract    :
              9451852  Lemons  A significant mismatch exists between what traditional A&P
              courses  offer and what many non-traditional students need. As a result,  these
              students are not learning how systems function, but are  memorizing many facts
              about them. We propose innovative  laboratories which present function first in
              the context of a broad  organizing theme, and then introduce anatomical and
              physiological  details to explain the function. We begin with hands-on 
              investigations using physical models and then progress to computer  simulation,
              anatomical correlations and experiments. This reverses  the traditional order
              of learning, helping students move from  concrete experiences to formal
              thinking about dynamic physiological  processes. The centerpiece of these new
              laboratories are  Multi-purpose Laboratory Workstations based on the Macintosh
              Quadra  660AV with CD-ROM, running LabView and multi-media software, and 
              connected to the Virtual Scientist interface which conditions  signals from a
              variety of transducers and controls experiments and  models. This proposal is
              complementary to a CCD project entitled,  "Developing critical thinking and
              content mastery in  non-traditional students: a comprehensive, technologically
              enhanced  approach." It will allow us to outfit the laboratories with 
              equipment necessary to implement the new A&P curriculum we are  developing.
