Abstract    :
              9451516  Stripeik  We will develop a new laboratory curriculum for an
              introductory  physics class that serves Pre-medical, Physical Therapy, and
              Allied  Health Professions majors. The experiments will show how basic  physics
              is applied and used by people in the medical professions.  Major equipment in
              the laboratory will include computers, data  acquisition hardware, and
              specialized pieces of equipment to  perform experiments dealing with sight,
              sound and hearing, stress  and strains on objects such as bones, and fluid flow
              as in the  circulatory system. In addition the equipment will be used to 
              demonstrate the experiments developed during the annual Physics  Teacher
              Conference and Physics Contest held at Saint Louis  University.
