Abstract    :
              The department of Chemistry is purchasing computerized interface  systems for
              the acquisition, display and analysis of experimental  data in the lower
              division undergraduate laboratories. The systems  are being used by both
              non-majors and majors and in the preparation  of pre-service elementary school
              teachers. Through use of the  systems students are having more time to consider
              the chemistry  that is taking place and concentrating less on the repetitive,
              time  consuming experimental methods. The use of computerized interface 
              systems reflects the manner in which modern chemistry takes place  in research
              and industrial laboratories.
