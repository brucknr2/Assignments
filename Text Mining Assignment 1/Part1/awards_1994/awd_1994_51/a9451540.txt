Abstract    :
              This project is increasing interest in and understanding of the  practice of
              chemistry among both majors and non-majors through the  incorporation of
              several new experiments into the curriculum which  employ FT-IR spectroscopy. 
              The early introduction to the actual  practice of chemistry through broader use
              of modern instrumentation  is expected to attract additional students to major
              in chemistry  and generate more scientifically literate non-science college 
              graduates.  Additionally, new experiments are being developed that  include the
              application of FTIR methods for environmental pollution  monitoring, polymer
              analysis and structure determinations of  organometallic and coordination
              compounds.
