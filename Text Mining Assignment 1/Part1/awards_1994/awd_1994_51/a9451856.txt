Abstract    :
              9451856  Rhodes  Geographical information systems (GIS) are a powerful tool for 
              understanding the spatial relationships that are fundamental to  field-based
              sciences like geology and biology.  This project  therefore provides
              undergraduate geology and biology students with  instrumentation that can be
              used to acquire spatially distributed  data, to learn modern techniques for
              processing the data, and to  gain experience in analyzing and interpreting the
              information.  These activities provide hands-on involvement that is essential
              to  active learning, and the instruments are used in lower- and  upper-division
              laboratory courses and for independent research. It  is also expected that the
              project will enhance students'  understanding of modern field methods, support
              their exploration of  scientific principles, and provide them experiences in
              formulating  real problems and proposing solutions.
