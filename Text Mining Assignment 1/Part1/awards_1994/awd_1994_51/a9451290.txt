Abstract    :
              9451290  Crean                                                     The
              undergraduate laboratory curricula for General Chemistry and  Analytical
              Chemistry will be improved using a DOS diode-array  ultraviolet-visible
              spectrophotometric system equipped with a  sipper. Since the entire spectrum of
              a solution can be recorded in  a few seconds using a diode-array instrument,
              all students in a  general chemistry laboratory section will be able to record
              the  entire ultraviolet and/or visible absorption spectra of species and 
              mixtures being analyzed. Because the DOS based spectrophotometric  system can
              quantitate the components in a mixture, it will now be  possible to include a
              kinetics experiment giving concentration  versus time data in the General
              Chemistry curriculum. The  enhancements and additions to the laboratory
              curriculum will serve  (1) to facilitate students' knowledge bases for making
              decisions  about how to take spectrophotometric data and (2) to improve 
              students' understandings of (2a) equilibrium systems, (2b) kinetics  of
              reactions, and (2c) relationships among visible  spectrophotometry, colors of
              chemical species, and d-electron  energy levels. Additionally students will be
              using instrumentation  comparable to that which they will encounter in industry
              and in the  health care arena.
