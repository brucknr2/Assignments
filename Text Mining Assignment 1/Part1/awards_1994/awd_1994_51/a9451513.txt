Abstract    :
              9451513  Shabestary   The proposed project is designed to strengthen the
              chemistry  department's undergraduate curriculum in regards to physical 
              chemistry laboratory. The main objective of the proposed work is  to
              familiarize students with excited state reactions, via  absorption and
              fluorescence (emission) spectroscopy. We propose  to purchase a temperature
              controlled UV-visible spectrometer and  a temperature controlled
              spectrofluorimeter. These instruments  are quite versatile and a broad range of
              experiments can be  developed. Initially, we propose to develop four
              experiments: (1)  spectroscopy of excited state proton transfer reactions; (2) 
              thermodynamics of excimer formation for pyrene; (3) excited state  properties
              of 2-naphthol; and (4) kinetics of the tautomerization  of acetylacetone enol.
              In time, additional experiments may be  developed and incorporated into the
              curriculum. These experiments  will stimulate interest in experimental physical
              chemistry, and  demonstrate excited state phenomena. These experiments are not 
              currently possible at our university.
