Abstract    :
              9451620  Newman  Life science and pre-medical students at Union College have
              studied  physics in a traditional two-term calculus-based sequence designed 
              for engineering and physical science students. Representing about  20% of our
              undergraduates, these students have been ill-served in  their introductory
              courses in physics. A newly developed two-term  sequence of courses will
              provide a modern introduction to the  applications of physics to biology
              (mostly at the molecular and  cellular level) by spending roughly 25% of the
              time on such  applications in a lecture/discussion format. These courses will 
              present fundamental physics in a challenging and relevant manner,  will use
              calculus, and will stress both conceptual thinking and  quantitative reasoning
              throughout. It is proposed to develop  laboratory experiences which are focused
              on life science themes for  these students. A totally new laboratory curriculum
              will be  developed to relate physical principles to the structure, function, 
              and the study of biological systems. Examples of experiments  include the study
              of the motion of bacteria, the stress/strain  relations in bone, the flow of
              fluids through arteries, model  electric circuits for nerves, feedback loops
              representing the pupil  of the eye, and chaotic circuits of importance in the 
              interpretation of heart rate and EKG, laser absorption and  fluorescence
              spectroscopy as applied to biological samples, and  depth perception and
              binocular vision. These novel experiments fit  well with the themes developed
              in the courses and should stimulate  student enthusiasm and interest in the
              underlying physics.  ***y
