Abstract    :
              9451911  Fennessey                                                 The chemistry
              component of the environmental studies program has a  heavy emphasis on
              instrumental methods, primarily for water  chemistry. This emphasis includes an
              extended sequence in infra-red  spectroscopy which begins in General Chemistry.
              This area of study  is being served by a FT-IR allowing instructional program
              to extend  to significant environmental applications in a) air chemistry ( 
              with a long path gas cell ), b) water chemistry ( using a Circle  cell and
              other ATR devices ), and c) eluate identification with  GLC, HPLC and TLC.  The
              instrument is also being used by the  Biology Department for respiration
              studies of small mammals.
