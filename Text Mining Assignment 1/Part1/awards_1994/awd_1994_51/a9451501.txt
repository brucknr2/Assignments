Abstract    :
              9451501  Pavia  This proposal introduces molecular modeling and computational 
              chemistry into the undergraduate curriculum beginning with first  year
              chemistry and progressing with increasing degrees of  sophistication in higher
              level courses. In the first year students  will be concerned principally with
              model building and the testing  of common bonding theory (VSEPR and VB). For
              organic chemistry,  conformational analysis, reaction modeling, and reaction
              dynamics  would be introduced judiciously via force-field and molecular 
              orbital and MOPAC calculations. In the third year for the  integrated
              inorganic/physical laboratory, students would model  zeolites and learn
              applications of MO theory to inorganic and  organometallic compounds.
              Biochemistry students would also be  introduced to the use of the Brookhaven
              Protein Data Bank files.  They would also be taught to model docking operations
              at an active  site and to evaluate potential substate antagonists by least 
              squares fitting routines.  It is our belief that molecular modeling  will have
              far reaching pedagogic consequences because of its  predictive abilities and
              superb graphics and belongs in the  undergraduate curriculum. This proposal, if
              funded, will provide  for six molecular modeling workstations to be used in the
               environment of an open computer lab.
