Abstract    :
              9451355            Eastlake   This project provides students with hands-on
              experience with Design  For Manufacturing (DFM) as well as the latest in CAD
              software in an  integrated package.  This is accomplished by acquiring a
              developed  and proven computer-aided design and manufacturing (CADAM) 
              hardware/software package which can be directly incorporated into  the
              two-semester capstone aircraft design sequence in the Aerospace  Engineering
              program.  Initially, this system is being employed for  manufacturing wind
              tunnel models in the Aircraft Preliminary Design  course and for designing,
              analyzing, and manufacturing proof-of-  concept structural components in the
              Aircraft Detail Design course.  Solid modeling and rapid prototyping employing
              stereolithography  have been successfully introduced and DFM/CADAM is the next
              logical  step.  This exposure demonstrates one of the ways that increased 
              attention to the practical realities of modern manufacturing within 
              engineering education can assist in making industry more efficient  and
              productive.
