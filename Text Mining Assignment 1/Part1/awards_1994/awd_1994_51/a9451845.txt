Abstract    :
              9451845  O de Sa  This project creates a new course to provide integrated
              training in  the theory and practice of Molecular Evolution to science majors 
              using a strong "hands-on" approach.  Students select and carry on  experiments
              involving a wide range of molecular techniques. The  class format emphasizes
              two components: Inquiry and "Know-how." The  first emphasizes exercises to
              develop communication and critical  thinking skills through evaluation and
              analysis of data,  experimental designs, and written assignments. The second
              component  focuses on four key approaches to generate productive and Ph.D. 
              bound science graduates: Collaborative Inquiry: Student teams learn  to use
              different molecular methodologies by pursuing their own  experiments; Core
              Molecular Methodologies: Students learn the  applications and advantages of
              each molecular technique and   acquire the needed technological competence;
              Critical Thinking: The  experimental data obtained provides an excellent
              opportunity for  students to critically analyze the experimental designs and to
               develop their own research questions and proposals; Communication:  Students
              interpret and explain their experimental results, which  reinforces the
              development of their communication skills. The new  RC24 Superspeed centrifuge
              enables the students to carry out many  of the steps necessary for manipulating
              genes and vectors for  cloning purposes.
