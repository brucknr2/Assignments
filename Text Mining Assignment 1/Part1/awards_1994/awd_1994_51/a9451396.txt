Abstract    :
              9451396  Buschert                                                  We propose to
              create a new introductory physics laboratory, which  is investigatory in
              nature, provides a closer link with more  advanced studies, and introduces
              students to research techniques.   Students will carry out one main experiment
              of their own design.   Computer-based data collection and spreadsheet analysis
              will be  used, affording students experience using the tools and methods 
              common to modern research.  The main experiment would be limited to  the
              general area of resonance of a damped and driven oscillator or  system of
              oscillators.  The oscillator was chosen because of its  centrality in physics,
              its connection with subsequent upper-level  courses, and the fact that it
              provides the students a wide variety  of effects to investigate, including the
              currently active topic of  chaotic motion.  To provide flexibility, the
              oscillatory systems  will be built in house.  Each oscillator system will
              require a  driver, a mechanical transducer, a range finder, and a data 
              acquisition/analysis and modelling system consisting of a 486 level  computer
              and software.
