Abstract    :
              9451915  Johnston                                                  This project
              enhances experimental psychology by providing  creative, hands on laboratory
              courses based on compelling visual,  auditory, and cognitive effects that
              provide a good entry to the  benefits of the scientific method. Specific
              courses affected by  include visual perception, learning and memory, and
              neuroscience.  Microcomputers with specialized audio and video hardware offer
              an  intuitive user interface and excellent graphical capabilities. A  suite of
              drawing, painting, rendering, and animation software  packages provide the
              capability to generate most perceptual  phenomena of current research interest.
              Also, students will be able  to create their own stimuli, run experiments, and
              analyze their  data without the need for computer programming skills.
