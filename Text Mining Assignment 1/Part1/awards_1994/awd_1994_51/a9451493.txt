Abstract    :
              9451493  Brazdil                              Capillary gas chromatographs are
              enhancing the basic chemical  principles taught in the general chemistry
              offered both science  majors and nonscience majors. The students are using 
              instrumentation practicing chemists use on a routine basis to gain  a better
              understanding of such topics as qualitative  identification, calibration and
              quantitation, identification of  chemicals present in household products,
              Henry's Law, partitioning  behavior of substances, and LeChatelier's Principle.
              Additionally,  illustrating the connections between gas chromatography and
              paper  or thin layer chromatography, enables students to better understand  the
              underlying equilibrium partitioning principles involved in all  forms of
              chromatography.
