Abstract    :
              9451682  Healy                                                     The project
              will establish the HPLC method as a fundamental  instrumental component in the
              biochemistry laboratory curriculum.  The HPLC will be used for experiments
              involving peptide structure  determination, conformational and kinetic analysis
              of small  antibiotics, protein isolation and enzymatic active site analysis.  
              Additionally experiments involving modern reverse-phase and chiral  HPLC
              techniques will be incorporated into the second semester  organic laboratory.
