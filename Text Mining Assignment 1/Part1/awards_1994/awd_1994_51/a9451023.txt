Abstract    :
              t9451023  Steen                                Santa Fe Community College is
              establishing two computer  laboratories for mathematics instruction and
              providing computer  equipment for several mathematics classroom. They are
              revising the  mathematics curriculum, beginning with the calculus, to emphasize
               conceptual understanding and problem solving. Initially, the  project is
              impacting 1,100 students per year with the potential of  serving more than
              3,000 Calculus, Differential Equations,  Statistics, and Precalculus students
              per year. A laboratory  component is an essential part of the plan. This
              mathematics  initiative is designed to motivate students for success and 
              stimulate an interest in calculus by emphasizing collaborative team  learning,
              discovery-based learning, and practical application  models. The laboratory
              component is providing visual reinforcement  of mathematical concepts and
              encouraging student exploration and  experimentation through open-ended
              exercises. Instruction  emphasizes solution strategies, modeling skills, and
              mathematical  reasoning. They are also promoting the development of students' 
              verbal and written communications skills through laboratory  reports. These
              student writings foster the ability to explain the  practical significance of
              application problems and their solutions.  An ongoing formative evaluation is
              an integral part of the  development process and is guiding them throughout the
               implementation of the grant. They are collecting and analyzing data  on the
              effectiveness of the laboratory team approach. Participating  faculty are
              developing computer-interactive laboratory assignments.
