Abstract    :
              9451512  Porter  Computational science is becoming an integral part of science,
              but  is rarely treated from a balanced interdisciplinary perspective in 
              undergraduate curricula.  This project by the departments of  computer science,
              mathematics, and physics develops an an  interdisciplinary course in
              computational science at Furman  University.  Students in this course are
              divided into teams,  composed of of one student from each of the three
              departments  involved.  Each team selects a physical system, develops a 
              mathematical model of it, and constructs an algorithm culminating  in the
              computer simulation complete with sophisticated  visualization tools used to
              display the output.     The finished projects will reach a wider audience in
              that they will  become a basis for demonstrations and laboratory exercises for 
              other courses.  Other disciplines, including non-science majors,  will
              eventually become part of the projects.
