Abstract    :
              9451925  Knight  The aim of this project is to foster critical thinking and
              improved  scientific writing among rural undergraduate biology students. 
              Development will be effected through a program of courses that  encourage
              research and learning which is progressively more  independent of faculty and
              more in collaboration with other  students. Much basic equipment has been
              purchased for this project  with private donations; however, an infrared gas
              analyzer, an  analytical oxygen analyzer, a carbon dioxide sensor, and 
              electrophoresis equipment are needed to expand the exposure of  students to
              technical instrumentation and provide a wider range of  opportunities for
              original student research in plant physiology,  human and animal metabolism,
              and molecular and cellular biology.  The project is significant because it is a
              departure from the  traditional approach to teaching biology at this small
              university.  The project is a comprehensive strategy affecting the style and 
              content of most biology courses. This new biology program is  expected to
              attract more students into biology at the University of  the Ozarks and enhance
              the rate of alumni matriculating into  graduate and professional schools.
