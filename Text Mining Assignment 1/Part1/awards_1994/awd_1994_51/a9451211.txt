Abstract    :
              9451211  Erdmann                                                   This project
              exposes undergraduates to the fundamentals of  manipulation robotics. We will
              build a teaching laboratory for  undergraduates interested in robotics. The
              laboratory will be at an  intermediate stage of advancement situated between
              the basics  taught in an undergraduate robotics course and the advanced topics 
              taught in first year graduate courses. The laboratory will provide  hands-on
              experience for undergraduates. Our goal is to strengthen  the manufacturing
              base by educating students in the fundamentals of  industrial manipulation and
              by exposing them to the practical  research results of the last two decades. 
              We envision that the  laboratory will contain a series of robots, geometric
              modeling  systems, and small-scale factory work cells. The robots will be 
              Zebra Zero force-controlled robots, controlled from workstations  running
              planning and geometric modeling systems. Each robot will be  given a camera and
              frame grabber for use in hand-eye tasks.   Undergraduates will be expected to
              enroll in this laboratory course  for academic credit. The curriculum will
              consist of a structured  sequence of robot manipulation tasks, ranging from
              parts orienting,  to parts assembly, to the planning and execution of
              cooperative  robot strategies among several robots.
