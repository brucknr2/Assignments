Abstract    :
              9451456  Williams  This project proposes to upgrade the teaching of NMR in
              organic  chemistry, analytical chemistry & physical chemistry and facilitate 
              undergraduate research, through the replacement of computer-  simulations and
              photocopies with hand-on use of an FT-NMR  Spectrometer by students. The
              organic chemistry lab will be divided  into "mini-research" projects all of
              which will employ NMR for the  characterization of products and the analysis of
              reaction mixtures.  Students in Quantitative analysis will observe a single
              signal for  2 exchangeable protons and relate it to the concentration of the 
              mixture. Instrumental Analysis students will determine the signal  to noise
              ratio and resolution under various experimental  conditions. In the Physical
              Chemistry lab NMR will be integral in  experiments involving relaxation times,
              magnetic susceptibility and  inorganic synthesis. Implementation of this
              project will  considerably affect the level of education offered by the
              Chemistry  Program at Francis Marion University.
