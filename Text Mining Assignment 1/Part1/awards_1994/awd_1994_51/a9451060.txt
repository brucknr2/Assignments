Abstract    :
              The the molecular biology component of the plant biochemical and  physiological
              curriculum at LSU-Shreveport will be enhanced by  providing students enrolled
              in laboratory class at several levels  with the cell and tissue culture
              facilities necessary for plant  physiology and plant molecular biology
              laboratory work.  The  requested equipment will be used in a series of
              experiments  designed to enable students to formulate and test hypotheses 
              related to the understanding of important concepts in plant  physiology and
              molecular biology. In the 100 and 300 level courses,  students will investigate
              phenomena regarding the phytohormone  ratios necessary to initiate the growth
              of callus tissue and to  regenerate plants from callus tissue. Students
              enrolled in the 400  level class will gain experience in genetic
              transformations using  Agrobacterium tumifaciens and conduct experiments in
              gene  regulation using plant tissue that has been transformed with the  GUS
              reporter gene system under the control of constitutive and heat  shock promoter
              elements.  In addition to serving a pivotal role in  the instructional
              laboratory classes, the requested equipment also  will enable undergraduates
              engaged in research projects to conduct  individual investigations.
