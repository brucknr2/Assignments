Abstract    :
              9451410  LaRose  To meet the needs of its diverse student population Greenfield 
              Community College actively promotes innovative and experience-based 
              interactive education. Project TEME (Totally Enclosed Modular  Environments),
              the experiential core of the Human Ecology  curriculum, is available to all
              students attending the college.  Project TEME, is a proven learning experience
              that has featured a  simulated space exploration mission as a metaphor for
              "Spaceship  Earth" since 1980, and introduced a deep sea submersible mission to
               explore the oceans in 1992. While mission scenarios vary, each  mission is
              designed to introduce students to basic ecological  principles, effective group
              process, and the scientific  applications of technology to study and solve
              ecological problems.   This proposal will develop a WINDOWS for Workgroups
              multimedia LAN  to enhance the authenticity of the TEME experience beyond the 
              capabilities of the current 8- bit stand-alone technology.   Upgrading to an
              integrated network of multimedia PCs as part of a  wider area network allowing
              for access to global resources (INTER  NET) enables students to view the scope
              of data and resources  available to solve ecological problems, and provides
              direct  communication between the project and major universities,  government
              agencies, research institutions and information  services. With a more powerful
              and expanded networking system, the  TEME curriculum has the potential for
              greater  transportability  serving as a national model for hands-on science
              education.
