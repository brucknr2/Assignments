Abstract    :
              9451327  Dinan                                                     This project
              will upgrade the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)  capabilities of the Canisius
              College Chemistry Department.   A multinuclear FT instrument was selected in
              order to expand the  NMR experience to other than traditional organic
              applications. The  instrument will affect instruction in five different courses
               including traditional laboratories in organic chemistry and  spectroscopic
              analysis, as well as laboratories in inorganic,  physical and polymer
              chemistry. This instrument will also  significantly enhance the interest level
              generated by undergraduate  research projects, which are an integral part of
              the teaching  process at Canisius.  The instrument selected is well suited to 
              function as both a teaching and research instrument.  The student  experience
              will provide the laboratory background needed to clarify  the abstract
              theoretical concepts which underlie modern NMR  spectroscopy. Nontraditional
              application of NMR will prepare  students for future creative work with NMR
              inqtrumentation.
