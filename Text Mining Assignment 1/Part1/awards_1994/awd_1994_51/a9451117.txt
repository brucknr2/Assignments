Abstract    :
              A biological oxygen monitoring system for the direct measurement of  metabolic
              activity within organisms provides the resources for  laboratory exercises
              examining such metabolic processes as  photosynthesis and cellular respiration.
              The versatile system is  used to evaluate different metabolic processes in
              bacteria, plants  and animals. Exercises utilizing the oxygen monitoring system
              will  clarify concepts discussed in lecture by providing students with 
              hands-on experience.  Advanced students in biological chemistry use  the
              equipment to design and perform experiments analyzing specific  biochemical
              reactions.
