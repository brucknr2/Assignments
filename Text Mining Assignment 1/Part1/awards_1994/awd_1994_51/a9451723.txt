Abstract    :
              9451723  Stephenson-Hawk                                           The
              comprehensive academic, research, and outreach program in Earth  System Science
              (ESS) is continuing to be strengthened through the  enhancement of the ESS
              laboratory.  Earth System Science is the  interdisciplinary study of the earth,
              as a system, and its  component parts, which include the atmosphere, maritime
              regions,  biological and hydraulic cycles, and geographic features, their 
              interaction and evolution.  The overall motivation for a program of  study in
              Earth System Science is to expose a large segment of the  University's faculty
              and students to the multidisciplinary nature  of the subject while
              simultaneously increasing the numbers of  minority students pursuing careers in
              this and related areas.  A  laboratory that is used to accompany a recently
              developed course  entitled "Introduction to Earth System Sciences" is being
              further  developed and equipped.  This course targets (1) first and second 
              year students that are interested in pursuing ESS careers or are  interested in
              learning more about the environment in which they  live, (2) elementary and
              secondary education majors that will  eventually teach in our nation's
              classrooms, and (3) students that  need a laboratory science course to fulfill
              their requirements for  a bachelor's degree.  The requested equipment, coined,
              educational  development workstations, allows the inclusion of interactive, 
              multimedia based teaching modules in our developing Earth System  Science
              program.
