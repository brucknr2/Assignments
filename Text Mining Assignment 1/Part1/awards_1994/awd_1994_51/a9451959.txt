Abstract    :
              9451959  Monroe  The goal of this project is to improve the learning of physics
              at  Southwest Texas Junior College and to improve the retention of  students
              and the attraction to major studies in physics,  particularly among women and
              the Hispanic population. This  project proposes to develop and implement new
              laboratory  activities in three physics course sequences during the next two 
              years.  The lab curricula will be adaptions of the curriculum  developed by Ron
              Thornton and Priscilla Laws, using  microcomputers to collect data and perform
              analysis and graphing  as controlled by the students.  The lab activities will
              be  developed in the area of mechanics, heat, sound, electricity and 
              magnetism, light and nuclear physics.  The project requests support for six
              networked lab stations  equipped with Mac Quadra 650 microcomputers, Universal
              Lab  Interfaces and appropriate sensors and probes.  In addition, lab 
              equipment to be used with the MBL tools as well as a laser  printer and scanner
              are requested.  The project expects to more actively involve the students in
              lab  activities and thereby improve the learning of physics through  the new
              technologies of the microcomputers and with proven lab  curricula.  As a result
              more students will support physics  because of their positive experiences and
              may elect to continue  their studies in physics.  Students will be better
              prepared for  the technologies of the twenty-first century and science literacy
               in southwest Texas will increase.
