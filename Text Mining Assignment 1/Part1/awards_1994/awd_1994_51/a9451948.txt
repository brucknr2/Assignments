Abstract    :
              9451948  Williams  A new advanced undergraduate laboratory in plasma physics
              will be  created for training students who will specialize in high  technology
              areas which rely on a working knowledge of plasma  phenomena, such as plasma
              processing of materials, fusion energy  and gaseous electronics. Two
              experimental stations will be built,  on which students will learn basic vacuum
              techniques, plasma  production techniques, basic plasma diagnostics. Students
              will be  introduced to basic plasma physics by studying particle motions, 
              fluid phenomena, waves, beams, diffusion, resistivity, equilibrium,  stability,
              kinetic theory and nonlinear effects. Lecture notes and  a laboratory manual
              will be generated.
