Abstract    :
              9451220  Gupta                                                     Scanning
              Probe Microscopy (SPM) produces extremely high resolution  image of a specimen
              surface that is quantitative in three  dimensions. The image is precise enough
              to examine grain  boundaries, quantify surface roughness, measure
              microstructural  defects, provide surface profile, and even visualize the
              atomic  configuration of the specimen surface. SPM is now a routine  microscopy
              tool used for metrology and extremely high-resolution  profilometry. Since
              scanning probe microscopes are commercially  available with mature inexpensive
              technology, this proposal  requests matching support from NSF for the equipment
              to introduce  students in Mechanical and Microelectronic Engineering programs
              to  scanning probe microscopy in a significant way.  Students will use  the
              equipment in a number of required courses, and in senior 
              design/seminar/research projects involving open-ended problems.  With the
              equipment, students will be able to visualize atomic  configuration at material
              surfaces, understand fundamental  relationships between bulk material
              properties and size-scale, see  sub-microscopic structures in detail, and
              quantitatively  characterize effects microelectronic processes have on material
               surfaces during integrated circuit fabrication. Microelectronic  engineers and
              mechanical engineers working together to design and  build prototypes of
              micro-electromechanical systems will also be  able to characterize their
              prototypes with the SPM equipment.
