Abstract    :
              9451666  Baria  Undergraduate unit operations laboratories in chemical
              engineering  will be enhanced via practical experience in the application of 
              engienering principals to hazardous waste processing, materials  recycling and
              pollution prevention.  Specifically,  experiments to  be created include a
              continuous distillation unit for solvent  recovery, reverse osmosis and
              ultrafiltration for the removal of  small and large chemicals from waste water,
              apparatus for the  evaluation of the quality of waste water by biochemical
              oxygen  demand (BOD), an ion exchange unit for the removal of metals from 
              effluents, and a stack gas emission analyzer to detect unwanted  products from
              incineration.
