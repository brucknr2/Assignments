Abstract    :
              9451489  Dietrich  This Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement project
              involves  the revision of an undergraduate database course to include a 
              laboratory project that allows students to acquire practical  experience using
              a commercial database product.  A unique aspect of  the work is the way in
              which cooperative learning techniques are  used in administration of the group
              projects.  Each project is  divided into different phases corresponding to
              different functional  aspects of database development.  Those phases include
              requirements  analysis, conceptual modeling, relational database design and
              view  modeling, forms/report design, and application programming.  Students
              assume different roles during the course of the project,  such as phase leader
              for leading group activities, phase recorder  for organizing documentation
              activities, phase checker for  evaluating group members on the concepts that
              they have learned,  and phase technical advisor for leading the technical
              activities of  each phase. The advantage of this approach is that it not only 
              allows students to become more active participants in the learning  process but
              it also allows students to develop good leadership and  communication skills
              while learning the practical use of database  system software.  This project is
              therefore establishing a teaching  environment that provides a well-balanced
              mix of theory and  practice with emphasis on cooperative learning.
