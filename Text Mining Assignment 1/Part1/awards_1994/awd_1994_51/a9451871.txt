Abstract    :
              9451871  Snyder                                                    This project
              is improving undergraduate chemical engineering   education by introducing the
              investigation of molecular dynamics  for the characterization and analysis of
              polymers in the  polymer  and materials science laboratories. This enhancement
              is being  accomplished by developing new experiments using a Tetrahedron 
              Audrey 380A Dielectric Spectrometer System.  These experiments  provide
              students with insight into the molecular basis for polymer  properties, many of
              which are strongly linked to chain dynamics and  molecular mobility. Without
              this hands-on experience in polymer  structure-property relations, it is
              extremely difficult for the  students to apply classroom concepts to the
              design, development and  fabrication of advanced materials.  Using this
              equipment to perform  experiments, the students are able to study important
              problems such  as the fabrication of advanced composites and the recycle of 
              plastics. An outcome of these problem- solving laboratories will be  scientists
              and engineers with considerable experience in materials  engineering.
