Abstract    :
              9451387  Hannaford                                                         
              Engineering Education is undergoing a period of rapid change.  American
              industry needs engineers who can design products which are  competitive in
              quality and performance in an increasingly  aggressive global market place.
              There is a sense that dividing  Mechanical, Electrical, Industrial, and
              Computer engineers into  separate compartments may produce only locally optimal
              designs. In  education, the traditional emphasis on single-student analysis 
              within an "Engineering Discipline" is giving way to  interdisciplinary,
              design-team oriented education.  With these  global trends in mind, we propose
              a new laboratory-based course,  "Design of Consumer Electronics," to address
              the need for  interdisciplinary, design-team oriented education within the 
              College of Engineering at the University of Washington. We request  funding to
              develop this course, to disseminate the course content  and format to other
              institutions, and to encourage and compile an  expanding collection of
              curricular materials from among a diverse  group of faculty at UW and other
              institutions.
