Abstract    :
              9451393  Lawrance                                                  First year
              biology curriculum will be revised to reflect the  revolutionary changes which
              have taken place in biology over the  past two decades.  The freshman
              laboratory will serve as a  foundation in a sequence of three laboratory
              courses bridging  molecular & cellular biology, organismal biology (a merger of
              our  present offerings in botany & zoology), and ecology & evolution  (course
              already in place). The laboratory accompanying the first of  these three
              courses will focus not only on introducing molecular  genetics and attendant
              recombinant DNA techniques to freshman, but  also on integrating this knowledge
              with biochemistry and cell  biology to provide a solid foundation for the many
              diverse  processes studied in subsequent courses.  The equipment will enable 
              introductory experiments in quantitative analysis, tissue culture  &
              microbiology, cell architecture, protein biochemistry and  enzymology, DNA
              structure, gene mapping, DNA sequencing,  recombinant DNA techniques,
              transformation & phenotypic analysis.  In addition to providing students with a
              solid grounding in  molecular and cellular biology, the laboratory experiences
              will  also enhance students' abilities and opportunities for advanced  study in
              these areas.
