Abstract    :
              The focus of this project is to improve the methods of digital data  acquisition
              and presentation capabilities available to the students  involved in
              undergraduate programs. At least one faculty member has  current experience
              with each of the instruments being  used and the  project integrates
              interdisciplinary approaches to undergraduate  archaeological education. Also,
              techniques being utilized are at  the cutting edge of archaeological research.
              Data acquisition  instruments are linked together so that data and results can
              be  transmitted and displayed over systems networks. Students  completing their
              undergraduate programs and using modern technology  are competent professional
              archaeologists when they graduate, and  are prepared to attend graduate school
              or to work as contract  archaeologists.
