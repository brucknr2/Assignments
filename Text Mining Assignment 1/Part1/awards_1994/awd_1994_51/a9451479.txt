Abstract    :
              9451479  Perlin  A Biotechnology Methods course for undergraduates prepares
              students  to conduct Undergraduate Research projects which are not associated 
              with a specified course and thus serves to enhance undergraduate  research
              experiences at the University. This facility serves as the  basis for
              instruction in this newly-developed course and also  facilitates the use of
              such technology for existing courses and  several summer research programs. 
              The summer programs serve  Minority high school
