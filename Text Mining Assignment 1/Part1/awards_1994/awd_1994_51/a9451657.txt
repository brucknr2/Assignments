Abstract    :
              9451657  Perez-Arnau                                               Biology
              courses will be improved by introducing an innovative  system of microorganism
              classification which uses a modern method  of statistical analysis based on the
              fatty acid content. This  system, which uses the gas chromatograph, will be
              linked to a local  network in order to service a greater number of students.
              The  project will: 1) introduce a new microorganism characterization  method,
              2) update the chromatographic techniques in the  Microbiology laboratory, 3)
              increase the knowledge and skills of  the Biology students through the
              practical operation of high  technology instruments.  New experiments will help
              the students  acquire and/or improve the following skills: (A) relate
              structures  and chromatographs, (B) the analysis of statistical data and the 
              use of the MIDI system, (C) the management and operation of the  chromatograph,
              (D) comprehend the complex nature of the components  of microorganisms, (E)
              learn new taxonomic criteria based on  molecular composition.  The courses
              which the new technology will  benefit are the following: General Microbiology,
              Cellular and  Molecular Biology, Medical Microbiology, Industrial Microbiology,
               and Mycology.  The utilization of the gas chromatograph system and  the
              related software for the biochemical analysis of microorganisms  can be
              duplicated in other undergraduate settings. A lab manual in  Spanish will be
              produced and distributed.
