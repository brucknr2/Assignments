Abstract    :
              9451587  Strawil                                                     This
              project for chemistry laboratory curriculum improvement is  designed to bring
              more modern laboratory methods and advance  chemical concepts to freshman and
              sophomore science students at the  College of the Sequoias. To accomplish this
              objective, the college  will purchase a Fourier Transform Infra-Red
              Spectrophotometer  (FTIR) for use with microscale laboratory techniques in the 
              sophomore organic laboratory. The FTIR will allow expansion of  spectroscopic
              analysis in the organic laboratory and to complete  conversion to microscale
              methods and allow increased information  about the identity and purity of the
              small quantities of materials  generated by these techniques. It will also
              allow the introduction  of modern spectrographic techniques into the freshmen
              chemistry  courses.
