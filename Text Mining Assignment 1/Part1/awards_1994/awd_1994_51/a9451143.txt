Abstract    :
              9451143  Entrikin  This project focuses on water as an integrating theme in
              landscape  change, and is designed to expand quality undergraduate instruction 
              in field and laboratory methods and analytical techniques through 
              instrumentation. In particular, theoretical strengths are used to  initiate
              field and laboratory instruction in climatology through  climate
              instrumentation. Instruction in geomorphology involves the  hydrodynamics of
              estuaries, wetlands and nearshore environments.  Data acquisition and analysis
              are also being improved through use  of data loggers, digitizers, scanners, and
              related computer  hardware.  The project is expected to improve our data
              processing,  and will expand undergraduate instruction into a range of 
              information systems and modeling techniques.
