Abstract    :
              9451287  Laws  This project will continue the development of a complete
              university  introductory physics laboratory program called RealTime Physics 
              (RTP) begun under a previous ILI-LLD grant.  This program is  centered around
              the use of microcomputer-based laboratory tools for  observations and analysis
              of physical phenomena.  This project will  help institutions with conventional
              course structures to  incorporate interactive teaching approaches in their
              programs  without restructuring the entire program.  RTP labs share a common 
              philosophy with two previous programs, Workshop Physics and Tools  for
              Scientific Thinking: 1) belief that development of scientific  literacy is as
              important as traditional textbook problem solving  skills, 2) emphasis on the
              processes of oral and written  communication and peer learning, and 3)
              extensive use of  microcomputers, not as tutorial devices or teaching machines,
              but  rather for the acquisition of both qualitative and quantitative 
              information about physical phenomena.  The development of RTP  materials has
              made this holistic, learner-centered teaching  philosophy available to many
              more institutions by concentrating on  using the laboratory portion of
              traditional introductory physics  courses more effectively.  Our ultimate goal
              is to develop  sequenced sets of laboratories, spanning a complete range of 
              introductory physics topics.  We propose here to develop two  additional RTP
              laboratory activities guides, thermodynamics and  optics, to complement the
              guides already developed in mechanics and  circuits.
