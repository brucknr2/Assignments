Abstract    :
              9451088  Pletsch                              It is no secret American students
              generally avoid mathematics  courses. This is particularly true of minority
              students, half of  the T-VI student population. It is these very skills,
              however,  which can allow Native American, Hispanic, and White students to 
              better positions. Albuquerque T-VI's mathematics faculty is in the  process of
              reforming its mathematics curriculum to meet the needs  of the future work
              force and to make it more relevant, hands-on,  and interdisciplinary.   The
              computer classrooms on the two largest campuses of TVI are  dedicated to the
              modernization of the mathematics curriculum with  the focus on intermediate and
              college algebra. While according an  appropriate place to the underlying
              theory, this reform and  modernization is emphasizing the (a) numerical: the
              representation  of mathematical concepts by data sets, (b) the graphical: the 
              pictorial illustration of mathematical concepts, and (c) the  descriptive: the
              verbal and written presentation of concepts  computer literacy.
