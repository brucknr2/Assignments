Abstract    :
              9451949  Cunningham  Recognizing the importance of condensed matter physics in 
              undergraduate science education, Grinnell College seeks to  acquire a variable
              temperature, high-magnetic field materials  characterization instrument that
              will be used to integrate  condensed matter physics experiments into the
              physics curriculum.  In keeping with Grinnell's emphasis on innovation in
              teaching and  practical experience for students, the physics department 
              envisions a highly flexible instrument which can be used to  measure the
              resistivity, the dc magnetization, and the ac  magnetic susceptibility of a
              variety of samples. The proposed  instrument will enhance the intermediate and
              advanced  laboratories with five new condensed matter experiments: the Hall 
              effect, the quantum Hall effect, the de Haas-van Alphen effect,  Curie's law,
              and the critical magnetic field of superconductors.  These new experiments will
              enrich the experience of students in  condensed matter physics by allowing them
              to explore in the  laboratory phenomena which they currently encounter only in 
              textbooks. Through this laboratory experience, students will  explore general
              concepts, observe important physical phenomena,  and learn experimental
              techniques in low-temperature and  condensed matter physics. In addition, the
              proposed instrument  will enable advanced students to do independent projects
              and  summer research in condensed matter physics.
