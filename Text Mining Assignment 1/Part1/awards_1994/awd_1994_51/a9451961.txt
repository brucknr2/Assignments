Abstract    :
              9451961  Szmyd                                            The circuits
              laboratory developed serves as an integral part of a  restructured sequence of
              electrical circuits courses that includes  a freshman lecture and laboratory
              course taken by all engineering  majors. This course provides an introduction
              to electrical  engineering that includes applications in each of the
              engineering  disciplines, modern laboratory instrumentation and test methods, 
              computer aided data acquisition and processing, interactive 
              computer/instrument based tutorials, individual and team  activities, design
              projects, and technical communications. The  laboratory serves as a learning
              center and a resource to support  recruitment and retention efforts aimed at a
              significant population  of Native American students. The project also includes
              development  of curricular materials, instrumentation systems, and software to 
              serve as resources for other universities seeking innovation in  their freshman
              engineering programs.
