Abstract    :
              9451624  Simonis  The Department of Chemistry is rejuvenating a an aging high
              field  FT-NMR to provide undergraduate majors with an understanding of the 
              wide applications of NMR spectroscopy in biochemistry and inorganic  chemistry.
               The main emphasis of these curricular revisions is to  give undergraduates
              hands-on experience in modern one- and  two-dimensional homo- and non-proton
              heteronuclear NMR techniques  such as 13C and 31P NMR heteronuclear correlation
              spectroscopy  important to the structural characterization of biomolecules. In 
              the inorganic chemistry laboratories undergraduates are  investigating the use
              of NMR spectroscopy for the structural  characterization of inorganic compounds
              with complex spin systems.
