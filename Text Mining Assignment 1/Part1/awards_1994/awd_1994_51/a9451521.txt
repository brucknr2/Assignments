Abstract    :
              9451521  Tenney  The project will use computers to support and enhance the 
              laboratory component of general chemistry to make the subject more  relevant
              and current. The equipment needed for this proposal  consists of eight data
              acquisition and processing workstations. The  data acquisition and processing
              workstations will be used in  experiments involving real time measurements of
              thermochemistry,  phase transitions, electrochemistry, pH and potentiometric 
              titrations, chemical kinetics, and oscillating reactions. Using  graphical
              analyses of those data, the student can infer functional  relationships among
              the measured quantities without the tedium of  repetitive measurements. Focus
              will be placed on interpreting and  analyzing results. Students will be
              expected as the course  progresses to write their own programs to acquire and
              analyze their  data. The proposed hardware and software has been used in the 
              physical chemistry and the instrumental laboratories for three  years. Fully
              using computer technology in the general chemistry  should not only increase
              the number of students who succeed but  also produce students with improved
              critical reasoning, graphical  analysis, and problem solving skills.
