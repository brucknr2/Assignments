Abstract    :
              9451976  Jacobs                               past two decades, applications of
              tunable pulsed lasers and  molecular beams have revolutionized the field of
              Physical  Chemistry. Yet both of these major technological advances are far 
              from commonplace in most undergraduate laboratories. This project  introduces a
              Nd:YAG-pumped dye laser system and molecular beam  apparatus to the
              undergraduate Chemistry curriculum in a series of  experiments which
              interrogate the fast kinetics of chemical  intermediates in solution, the
              high-resolution nonlinear  spectroscopy of molecules and clusters in supersonic
              expansions,  and the dynamics of photodissociation in the gas phase. Students 
              will initially use the equipment to carry out structured laboratory 
              experiments; however, they will later have the opportunity to  utilize the
              apparatus in executing their own research proposals.  Throughout the year-long
              Physical Chemistry Laboratory course,  students will be challenged to learn
              exactly how instruments make  measurements, learn basic electronics, computer
              interfacing, and  data acquisition programming. This way, their scientific 
              exploration within the lab is no longer limited by their technical  expertise,
              but instead, they can creatively implement experiments  as their imagination
              guides them. Emphasis in the lab is placed on  the scientific process by which
              students formulate and implement  their own ideas.
