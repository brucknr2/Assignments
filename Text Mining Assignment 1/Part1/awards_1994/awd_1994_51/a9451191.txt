Abstract    :
              9451191  Sullivan                                                  The purpose
              of this project is to provide mechanical engineering  students with a highly
              interdisciplinary lab experience in the area  of instrumentation and control.
              The lab content is divided into  three sections; (1) generic characteristics of
              instrumentation  systems, (2) Transducer systems, and (3) interfacing and
              control.  In the first section of material, dead weight pressure testers are 
              used to introduce static calibration concepts, while  spring-mass-damper
              systems are used to illustrate the dynamic  characteristics of instrumentation
              systems. In section (2), common  transducer systems, (e.g. LVDTs, strain
              gauges, thermo-couples  etc.), are demonstrated. The third section of labs
              introduces basic  signal processing and control ideas. Noise reduction
              techniques  will be explored for measurement systems, and micro-computers will 
              be used in temperature control and motor speed control  applications. The lab
              program described here is designed to  accelerate learning in the area of
              modern instrumentation and  control by drawing on students existing background
              in mechanical  engineering. Student projects based on case studies from
              industry  will be user to provide realistic experiences. The intended result 
              is that mechanical engineering students would gain very practical  knowledge of
              instrumentation and control not usually included in a  mechanical engineering
              curriculum.
