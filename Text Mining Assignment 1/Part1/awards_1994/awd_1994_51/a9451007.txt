Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a 400 MHz FT-NMR for use  throughout
              the undergraduate curriculum.  As a result of a recently  completed an
              extensive review and revision of its curriculum the  Department has reorganized
              the basic four core semesters and  introduced new required courses in Synthesis
              and in Instrumental  Methods of Analysis, together with a set of new elective
              courses.   As perhaps the single most important structure determination method 
              in chemistry today and as one of the best ways students can make  observations
              directly tied to molecular structure, nuclear magnetic  resonance spectroscopy
              is playing a central role in the revised  program.
