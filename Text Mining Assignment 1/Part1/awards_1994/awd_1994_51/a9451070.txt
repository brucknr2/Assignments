Abstract    :
              9451070  Prothero  A new Macintosh computer laboratory is being set up
              specifically  for our lower division introductory geological science courses.  
              The two courses this laboratory is serving are Introduction to  oceanography
              (GS-4), serving 3OO/qtr, and General Geology (GS-2),  also serving 3OO/qtr. 
              They satisfy a "quantitative science"  requirement for the degree.  Either of
              these may be the only  science course many students are exposed to in their
              college  career.  They are also where many of our majors are inspired to  begin
              the study of the earth sciences, which means they are of  vital importance both
              in creating an informed electorate and in  maintaining a steady stream of
              future scientists.  The development  of computer assisted material for both
              GS-4 and GS-2 is being  actively pursued by W. Prothero (and other Geology
              faculty) with  both NSF and internal UCSB funding. Our goal is to provide each 
              student with an exciting and dynamic learning experience through  the use of
              "hands-on" learning tools. We are creating data rich  learning modules that
              encourage the student to explore and learn or  re-discover fundamental
              principles or ideas.  In these courses,  lower division non-majors have access
              to analysis tools and data  that have previously been available only to
              graduate students.  We  expect these courses to become models of effective
              teaching in  large class settings.
