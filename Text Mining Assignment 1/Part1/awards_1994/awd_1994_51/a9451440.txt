Abstract    :
              9451440  Billera                                                   The
              Mathematics Department at Cornell University serves the  mathematical needs of
              a diverse group of undergraduate students in  a variety of liberal arts fields,
              as well the more specialized  needs of undergraduates in such fields as
              physics, chemistry,  astronomy economics, biology and computer science,
              engineering,  agriculture, mathematics education, meteorology, and industrial
              and  labor relations.  To better take advantage of educational  innovations
              involving the use of computers in the teaching of  mathematics, the department
              is opening a new undergraduate computer  teaching laboratory. This teaching
              laboratory is enabling the  department to use technology effectively in the
              teaching of  upper-level undergraduate mathematics courses, especially those 
              required by students in other fields.
