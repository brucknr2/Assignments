Abstract    :
              9451506  Schadler                                                  An
              undergraduate molecular biology and biotechnology course for  undergraduate
              students includes a substantial laboratory component  that begins with
              fundamental laboratory protocols and proceed to  DNA isolation and
              characterization, restriction enzyme analysis,  cloning in prokaryotic vectors,
              construction and selection of  recombinants made in vitro, and preparation and
              analysis of gene  libraries. New equipment includes a high speed refrigerated 
              centrifuge, microcentrifuges, gel electrophoresis equipment, an 
              incubator-shaker, micropipettors, an ultraviolet transilluminator  and
              photographic camera.
