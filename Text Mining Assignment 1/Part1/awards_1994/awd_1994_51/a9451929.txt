Abstract    :
              This project involves a computer laboratory in sociology consisting  of 
              high-speed personal computers networked to the institution's  mainframe
              computer. A projection system and notebook computers are  also used in the
              classroom. The project has permitted the  department to enhance its curriculum
              at both the introductory and  advanced levels by significantly extending the
              teaching of social  scientific reasoning and analysis, and by increasing
              opportunities  for undergraduate student involvement in sociological research.
