Abstract    :
              9451656  Diaz                                 Computational science attempts to
              blend an applied discipline with  computational mathematics, computing, and
              visualization. Many  experiments that have traditionally been performed in a
              laboratory  are being augmented or replaced by computational simulations. A 
              computational scientist or engineer applies computational  technology in
              innovative and essential ways to advance the  respective discipline.
              Computational scientists and engineers work  to obtain a better understanding
              of some phenomena through a  judicious match of the scientific problem, the
              mathematical model  that describes it, the numerical technique employed in its 
              solution, the computer language and the computer architecture used  in its
              implementation, and the assessment of each of these steps  through
              visualization.  This project builds a visualization laboratory to support the 
              undergraduate computational sciences curricula. The goal is the  integration of
              visualization with the computational science courses  taken by all science and
              engineering undergraduate majors. We are  establishing a classroom
              demonstration and a visualization  laboratory available for the students use
              during scheduled  laboratory hours. The instructor uses the classroom
              demonstration  to bring to life important aspects of the material. The 
              visualization laboratory is integrated into courses that use a  problem driven
              paradigm for the presentation of the material. This  enhances the retention of
              computing technology by engineers and  scientist and facilitates their use and
              integration into other  areas of science and engineering curricula.
