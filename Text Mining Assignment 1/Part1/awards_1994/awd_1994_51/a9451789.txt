Abstract    :
              9451789  Zielinski  Three modern laser experiments with complementing
              computational  chemistry components are being incorporated into the physical 
              chemistry laboratory courses.  A nitrogen pumped dye laser and  boxcar gate
              setup is being used to study the atomic spectroscopy of  Ne or Ar.  The same
              laser system is being used to study the  photochemistry of Ru(II) diimine
              complexes where short time-scale  (10 - 100 ns) measurements of luminescent
              lifetimes are being used  to analyze the collision induced energy transfer
              between excited  metal complexes and organic quenchers.  The nitrogen laser is
              being  used with gated integration to implement an introductory Raman 
              spectroscopy study of CCI4, C2H50H, or C6H6.  These experiments use  a
              versatile computer interface and a departmental PC to control  scanning,
              acquisition and manipulation of data, and subsequent  plotting of results. 
              This is exposing our majors to modern optics  and computer based data
              acquisition techniques in a non-black box  learning situation.  An IBM RS6000
              computer workstation is being  used to implement the theoretical complement to
              each experiment.   Spartan v3.0 software is providing a convenient and easy
              interface  for students to compute and visualize molecular orbitals and 
              molecular structures.  The theoretical studies are intimately  integrated into
              the spectroscopy experiments using the lasers and  the departmental FTIR and
              UV-VIS instruments.  The full integration  of the three components,
              spectroscopy experiments, theoretical  chemistry, and molecular modeling, is
              essential for the  modernization of physical chemistry laboratory.  Methods for
               implementation of these integrated experiments would be of major  interest to
              other undergraduate institutions seeking to sustain  student interest in
              physical chemistry.
