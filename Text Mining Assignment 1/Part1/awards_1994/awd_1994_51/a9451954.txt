Abstract    :
              9451954  Jurgenson                            The Polymerase Chain Reaction
              (PCR) is used to effectively teach  the techniques of molecular biological
              experimentation in a way  that is both cost effective and safer for the
              undergraduate  student. With the acquisition of an oligonucleotide synthesizer,
              a  temperature cycler, and a video camera PCR is used as a fundamental  tool in
              the study of genes and also to teach students modern  methods of data analysis
              using image analysis and computer software  designed for the analysis of
              molecular biology data. This  technology also allows students to design and
              execute their own  experimental studies in the course.
