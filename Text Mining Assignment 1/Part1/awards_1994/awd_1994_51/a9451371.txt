Abstract    :
              9451371  Hudgings                                                            The
              broad goals of career education, education for life and  employment, form the
              core of the Computer Integrated Manufacturing  (CIM) curriculum. The CIM
              curriculum provides students with the  education and skills to respond to the
              present and future needs of  business and industry. The addition of a Rapid
              Prototyping System  to the CIM program is critical to the continued success of
              its  graduates.  Therefore, Camden County College is proposing the  acquisition
              of a Rapid Prototyping System which will enable  students to fully integrate
              Computer Aided Design (CAD) to Computer  Aided Manufacturing (CAM) to the
              Computer Numerical Control (CNC)  machining in an environment which mirrors
              current rapid prototyping  systems. Systems such as this minimize the "art to
              part" time  required in developing a new project. This project addresses an 
              industry need for well educated technicians in the manufacturing  technology
              field.
