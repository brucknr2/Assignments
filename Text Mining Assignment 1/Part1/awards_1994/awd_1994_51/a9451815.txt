Abstract    :
              9451815  Huse                                                      Kilgore
              College is a public community college located in the heart  of East Texas.
              Typical of the area, Kilgore has a high percentage  of low-income families and
              a high minority population.  Total  enrollment for the campus is approximately
              8,670 students with  4,570 in credit degree courses.  After a careful needs
              assessment,  the area of immediate need is the expansion of lab facilities to 
              include multimedia technologies for Computer Science majors.  This  grant 
              allows introductory computer science classes to enhance the  students education
              through multimedia in cooperative learning  groups.  Curriculum has been
              developed to include hands-on  activities using telecommunication, audio and
              video digitizing,  video disc, CD-ROM products and hypermedia.  Hypermedia 
              applications allow students to manipulate information in the form  of text,
              graphics, video, voice, and animation, and to access large  amounts of this
              information quickly and efficiently through the  creation of logical linkage. 
              The goal for the student lab  assignment is to allow each programming structure
              to be covered in  a visual and exciting way using multimedia technology so that
              this  enthusiasm and understanding can be carried to the students' other 
              programming courses.  Our society has changed dramatically over the  past
              decade, and our colleges must be restructured to accommodate  the increase in
              information and the technology used in harnessing  that information.  The
              hardware purchase allows students to expand  their knowledge of computer
              science through multimedia programming.
