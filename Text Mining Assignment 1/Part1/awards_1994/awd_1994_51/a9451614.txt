Abstract    :
              9451614  Naumann  Programming expertise is based on a solid theoretical
              foundation as  well as practical experience.  At Southwestern, we teach formal 
              derivation of programs from specifications (as developed and  practiced by
              Edsger W. Dijkstra, David Gries, and others) as the  central organizing topic
              of our first-year courses in computing.   Program derivation provides the
              foundation for most of the  student's subsequent study.  To support the
              creation and revision  of lengthy programs and derivations, we propose to use a
              "proof  editor" for which we need workstation computers.  The proof editor 
              program will facilitate communication among students and among  faculty at a
              number of schools developing courses in program  derivation.  Availability of
              advanced workstations will also  enhance student's practical experience in
              several other courses.
