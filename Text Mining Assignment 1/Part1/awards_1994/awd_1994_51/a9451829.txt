Abstract    :
              This project provides a completely self contained observing and  image gathering
              facility to be used in varied capacities by  different undergraduate
              populations. Introductory Astronomy  students will have the opportunity to use
              a completely computerized  8 inch telescope, coupled with a computer 
              controlled CCD camera to  obtain images.  Engineering students, in their junior
              year, will  can do astronomical projects using the same equipment. This project
               has been motivated by new skills the  project director learned this  past
              summer participating in the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for  Astrophysics
              program entitled "Research Techniques for  Undergraduate Faculty At Small
              Observatories". An observatory under  construction at the college, with a 16"
              computerized  Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope, will be utilized in conjunction
              with  some of the equipment in this project by engineering students in 
              advanced projects.
