Abstract    :
              9451135  Naim                                                      The goal of
              this project is to educate geography students about how  electronic information
              technology can be used to investigate  physical and human processes through
              analysis of spatial patterns.  To do this we will established an environmental
              remote sensing and  geographic information systems (GIS) Laboratory with
              cost-effective  workstations. Students use this equipment to investigate local 
              phenomena, such as air and water pollution, preservation of natural  resources,
              and the impact of urban and industrial development on  local rural areas. These
              applications give the students practical  experience in data collection,
              analysis, and dissemination, and  enhances their ability to work with real time
              data. The project has  also strengthened the geography curriculum by providing
              three new  courses in remote sensing, computer cartography, and GIS.
