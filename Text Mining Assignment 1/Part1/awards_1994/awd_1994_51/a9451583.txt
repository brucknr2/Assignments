Abstract    :
              9451583  Clark                                A laser laboratory will be
              developed to complement the Lasers  lecture course currently taught.
              Upper-level undergraduate physics  and engineering physics students are the
              primary target for the  Lasers course and this quarter-long (10-week)
              laboratory. Students  working in groups of 2 to 3 will rotate through
              laboratory  experiments. These experiments will be developed to reinforce the 
              concepts and models discussed in lecture. The Laser Laboratory  experiments
              will cover three basic components. First, the  experiments will provide
              introductory investigations to basic laser  parameters, such as laser power,
              beam divergence and cavity mode  structure. Second, the students will learn
              current optical  techniques for probing matter, in particular potential laser
              media.  Finally, the students will receive hands on experience in the 
              assembling and evaluation of modern laser systems. We will acquire 
              state-of-the-art light detection and laser systems which will be  utilized in
              essentially all laboratory components. The acquired  instrumentation will also
              be used in upgrading experiments for the  upper level Applied Optics Laboratory
              and provide further  opportunities for senior projects.
