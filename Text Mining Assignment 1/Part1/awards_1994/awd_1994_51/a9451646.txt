Abstract    :
              9451646  Duttera                                                   A new
              biotechnology/molecular biology course using   collaborative learning
              experiences includes: review of microbiology  techniques; analysis of genomic,
              phage, and plasmid DNAs by  restriction and electrophoretic techniques; cloning
              of genes;  restriction analysis of recombinant products; preparation of a gene 
              library; PCR; Southern Blot; and site-specific mutagenesis. The  theory and
              relevance of the laboratory experience is related  (through lecture and outside
              reading) to current research and  ethical issues. The students propose, defend
              and are offered the  opportunity to perform an independent research project.
