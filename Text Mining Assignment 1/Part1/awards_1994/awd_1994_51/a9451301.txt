Abstract    :
              9451301  Peterson  Economics courses at Furman University seek to acquaint
              students  with the "economic way of thinking." We want majors to understand 
              the thought processes involved in specifying an economic theory,  deriving
              implications from that theory, and testing the theory  using data from the real
              world. We hope that by the end of their  undergraduate education they will be
              able to view theoretical  arguments critically and begin to generate and test
              some simple  theories of their own. We want our students (majors and
              non-majors)  to know why economic thinking is important and to appreciate the 
              dynamic relationship between economic behavior and economic  institutions.
              Historically, lecture and textbook assignments,  supplemented with data and
              anecdotes from journals, magazines, and  newspapers, have been the principal
              classroom tools. Recent  technological developments have facilitated the use of
              a more  "active" set of teaching tools in economics which include data 
              viewing, transformation, and analysis; model creation, comparative  statics,
              and sensitivity analysis; and macro- and microeconomic  simulations. A computer
              laboratory with twenty-six workstations and  software for data analysis,
              mathematical modeling, and economic  simulations will be used to implement the
              full range of these  active-learning techniques. When combined with the
              appropriate  laboratory exercises in the principles, theory, econometrics, and 
              topics courses, the laboratory will help our students develop "the  economic
              way of thinking" and it will enable us to achieve our  curricular goals.
