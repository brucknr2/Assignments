Abstract    :
              9451326  McCutcheon                                                The
              mathematics department at Los Angeles Pierce College has been  actively engaged
              in a project to bring computers into their  calculus classrooms. They are one
              of the six consortium members of  the Interactive Mathematics Text Project
              jointly sponsored by IBM  and NSF.  Until this project they have used computers
              to supplement  instruction in an open laboratory that is being used to capacity
               for homework assignments. In this project Pierce is using computer  lessons
              they have developed and are developing as an integral part  of classroom
              instruction to replace, in part, instructor lectures  with student discovery.
              In addition,   they are using computers to train high school and college
              teachers  in the use and development of interactive computer lessons.
