Abstract    :
              9451689  Sher  The faculty in the Department of Mathematics at SUNY Nassau
              County  Community College have experience with using graphing calculators  and
              the Harvard Consortium Calculus materials in Calculus I and II.   The
              acquisition of 22 486 DX-2 mhz PC's with 17" color monitors  equips two
              classroom/laboratories for the teaching of calculus  using the HCC materials
              for Calculus I-III with technology fully  integrated.  Computer usage occupies
              approximately one-third of  clasq time where groups of three students work as a
              team at each  computer station.  The lab is available for student use outside
              of  class time as well.  Software, which includes lotus and Derive, is  used
              for inquiry and understanding of concepts.  Pedagogical  techniques adapt the
              Treisman model applied to the community  college environment by Wilkinson and
              Sher.  Each group of three  students work as a team on their group computer
              station in solving  problems posed by the instructor. Assignments are designed
              for  group interaction with interactive animated demonstrations of  concepts in
              mathematics.  The goal is improved performance for the  students taking core
              mathematics curriculums.  An assessment will  compare affected students with a
              control group to test this  hypothesis and to test the change in attitude
              realized.
