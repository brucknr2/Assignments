Abstract    :
              9451683  Devlin                                                     Computers
              and computerized data acquisition units will be used to  teach state-of-the-art
              techniques at each stage in the experimental  process - from initial
              observations and hypothesis formation, to  data acquisition and statistical
              analysis, to the production of the  formal lab write-up and class
              presentations.  The biology  curriculum of PSU is currently undergoing a major
              restructuring,  one that will result in the creation of new introductory level
              and  three 200-level biology courses. Laboratory instruction for these  new
              courses will focus primarily on the scientific method as a "way  of learning."
              In addition, the new 200-level courses have been  designated as "writing across
              the curriculum" courses, part of a  university-wide requirement that each major
              area of study  incorporate writing skills into its curriculum. This "back to 
              basics" approach will: 1) emphasize scientific experiment  procedures; 2)
              enhance computer literacy; 3) introduce technical  writing skills; 4) encourage
              an exchange of scientific ideas. Our  goal is to lay a solid foundation from
              which the student will be  able to ask more challenging questions later in
              their research or  professional careers.
