Abstract    :
              9451342  Rahnamai                                                  This project
              initiates an integrated manufacturing and controls  laboratory. The laboratory
              will have a major impact on  manufacturing and control courses, and provide a
              means for  developing an interdisciplinary senior laboratory exercise. The 
              objectives of the integrated laboratory are: (1) to provide a  laboratory
              environment where interdisciplinary experiments relating  to integrated
              manufacturing and control can be performed, (2) to  provide an opportunity for
              each of the engineering programs  (electrical, industrial, mechanical, and bio)
              to conduct  independent experiments relating to manufacturing and control, (3) 
              to provide for the students necessary experience in the  interdisciplinary
              nature of engineering practice, and (4) to  provide a facility for the design,
              development, testing, and  manufacture of plastic products. The laboratory is
              centered around  an extrusion system consisting of a 3/4 inch, bench top
              extruder,  a water trough, and a belt puller. The system also includes two 
              additional extruder screws and dies to produce rods and strips. The  extruder
              process will be controlled using a fast DSP board with:  (1) Cockpit software
              which allows on-line interaction and  modification of control algorithm
              parameters running on the DSP  board, (2) trace software which is used for data
              acquisition and  display of sensor signals and control variables; and (3) a C
              code  generator which is required for automatic implementation of the  control
              module generated using SIMULINK.
