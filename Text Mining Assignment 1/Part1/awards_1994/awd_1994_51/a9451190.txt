Abstract    :
              9451190  Lee                                                       A research
              platform developed at the University of Pennsylvania,  "teleconferenced
              workstations", expands a cutting-edge curriculum  in Telecommunications and
              Systems at Penn. "Teleconferenced  workstations" are a unique mode of
              communication currently being  used by members of the AURORA Gigabit Testbed,
              which connects Penn,  MIT, IBM Research, and Bell Communications Research. The
              test bed  service provision includes support for multimedia and 
              Teleconferencing. We will use and experiment with this technology  as part of a
              new course entitled "Distributed and Real-time  Systems", as well as in an
              existing course entitled  "Telecommunications networks". The courses not only
              discuss the  principles behind the technology, but have a carefully constructed
               laboratory component with projects that apply the concepts covered  in
              lectures to components of the prototyped system at Penn. This  will not only
              augment our current curriculum in Telecommunications  and Systems, but will
              serve as an excellent vehicle to evaluate the  effectiveness of the
              teleconferenced workstation environment.
