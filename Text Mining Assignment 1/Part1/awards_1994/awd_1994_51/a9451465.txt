Abstract    :
              9451465  Baker                                The Department of Chemistry,
              Physics and Engineering Studies at  Armstrong State College is improving its
              undergraduate chemistry  curriculum and strengthening its general science
              instruction  through acquisition of a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer. The 
              instrument is being used in organic courses to improve existing  experiments.
              Students in qualitative analysis are using the  instrument in an integrated lab
              to identify and quantity amounts of  volatile organics in water from various
              sites along the Savannah  River. Students in an advanced instrumental analysis
              course use the  instrument along with the FT-IR and NMR spectrometers to
              quantify  compounds via isotopic dilution methodology.  In addition, the 
              instrument is being incorporated into the department's physical  science
              sequence to introduce non-science majors to modern  laboratory instrumentation
              and enhances the department's outreach  program for high school chemistry
              students.
