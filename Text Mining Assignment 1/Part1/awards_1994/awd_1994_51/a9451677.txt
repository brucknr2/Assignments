Abstract    :
              9451677  Eleftheriou                          This project will develop an
              experimental course in inspection,  gaging and measurement systems as a
              significantly enhancement of  the manufacturing curriculum. The course will
              provide students with  background and hands-on experience in metrology, force 
              measurements, sources of inaccuracy in measuring instruments,  surface texture
              evaluation, statistical analysis of experiments,  and modern quality control
              instruments. The course will include a  sequence of experiments which will be
              conducted in a machine-shop  environment. The lack of a well equipped metrology
              laboratory  hinders the effective instruction of all manufacturing related 
              courses, and the new equipment will significantly contribute to  their
              improvement.   With the new instruments, students will be  able to improve
              mating of parts, design fixtures for quick-gaging,  improve their design
              through proper tolerancing, and propose  improved machining processes based on
              the experience they gain.   Course activities will link exposure to metrology
              operations by  high school, community college, and university students.  The 
              difference in the educational backgrounds of the different student  groups will
              be analogous to the one present between formally  trained engineers and
              technicians. Valuable lessons will be learned  by both groups of students
              through this exercise.
