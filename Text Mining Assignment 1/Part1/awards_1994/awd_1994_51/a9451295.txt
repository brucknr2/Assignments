Abstract    :
              9451295  Martin                               A compact (15 day) intensive (7.5
              hour/day) laboratory-based course  in Biotechniques extends the undergraduates'
              understanding of  biotechnology.  The course is team taught by three faculty
              with  expertise in each of the areas emphasized in the course: 1) cell  and
              tissue culture and applied immunology; 2) PCR and recombinant  DNA; and 3)
              protein purification and enzyme assay.  The course  complements previous
              courses in molecular biology by: 1) utilizing  and reinforcing concepts
              established in Genetics and Cell  Physiology, 2) giving students a realistic
              and significant  laboratory experience, and 3) extending the students' exposure
              to  key methods in biotechnology.
