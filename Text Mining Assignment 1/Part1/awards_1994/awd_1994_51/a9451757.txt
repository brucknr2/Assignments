Abstract    :
              9451757  White                                                     This proposal
              is for a CNC lathe to enable junior mechanical  engineering students to conduct
              their own SPC experiments. The  major application of the lathe will be in a
              required junior level  mechanical engineering course titled Manufacturing
              Methods. The  proposed CNC lathe would be used in the SPC module of this
              course.  Using the lathe, student teams will conduct an experiment to 
              determine if a manufacturing process is capable and in control.  Each student
              team must determine what should be measured and how to  make the measurements.
              The CNC lathe permits the timely replication  of a sufficient number of parts
              required for these experiments.  Additionally, the CNC lathe requested has an
              on board computer  which can be programmed to produce "good" or "bad" identical
              parts.  This latter aspect is a necessary ingredient for the students to be 
              able to determine the effect of variables, such as feed rates and  spindle
              speeds, on process control. This is a unique approach (and  something that is
              lacking) from most current mechanical engineering  curricula. Knowledge and
              practical experience in CNC/CAM and SPC  are critical tools for today's
              mechanical engineering graduates  planning to pursue a career in manufacturing.
