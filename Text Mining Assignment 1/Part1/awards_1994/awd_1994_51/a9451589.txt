Abstract    :
              9451589  Benner                                                            The
              purpose of this grant is to equip our introductory biology and  advanced
              laboratories (Genetics, Microbiology, Immunology) with  instrumentation to
              enable students to carry out advanced projects  in molecular biology. This
              hands-on approach is part of a  redesigned freshman biology sequence intended
              to act as a pump for  students into science. The more traditional laboratory
              approaches  to biology need to be complemented with modern experimentation. 
              This will not only attract more students into science, but will  also reduce
              the attrition rate of students who enter Rider College  with an interest in
              science.  Additionally, we hope to significant  impact the education of our
              future science teachers by providing  hands-on experience in molecular biology
              techniques.
