Abstract    :
              9451398  Petruccelli                                                         An
              innovative introductory statistics curriculum is being developed  at Worcester
              Polytechnic Institute under a two year CCD grant from  NSF entitled, "A Modular
              Laboratory nd Project-Based Statistics  Curriculum."  To support this project,
              a computer classroom is  being constructed which:  combines a lecture and
              demonstration  capability; and, provides room for hands-on laboratory
              activities  and the computing power of 25 color X-terminals connected to a 
              central workstation server.  The new introductory statistics  curriculum is
              being developed for science, engineering and  management students at WPI and as
              a model for such curricula  nationwide.  Focusing on the goals of teaching
              students to think  critically about data and having them experience the role of
               statistics in scientific investigation, the curriculum has among  its
              features: division of the material into one-week modules, each  based on a
              laboratory and project experience; a complete  restructuring of course content
              emphasizing exploratory, graphical,  and computational approaches to data
              analysis and inference; and  the incorporation of alternative teaching
              strategies such as  cooperative learning.  The modular course structure allows
              flexi-  bility in customizing the course to student and instructor needs,  and
              ensures portability to other institutions.  The labs and  projects provide
              students with hands-on experience in using  statistical methods in scientific
              experimentation, data production,  and data analysis.  The significance of the
              project is that it  provides a setting for trying new and innovative approaches
              to the  course content and delivery of introductory statistics at the  college
              level.
