Abstract    :
              A computer is used as both a simulation and measurement tool to  illustrate the
              behavior of analog electronic circuits. The Kolb  learning cycle and the 4MAT
              system are used to justify the  computer's role in experimentation. The
              incorporation of automated  device parameter extraction is used to obtain more
              accurate  computer simulations, and computer-controlled measurements 
              illustrate design trade-off issues. Because trade-off analysis  requires a
              large number of measurements, the computer is utilized  to automatically
              control some of the more redundant activities.  Using both simulation and
              automated measurement increases student  understanding of amplifier circuits
              and bridges the gap between  analysis and design.
