Abstract    :
              Two important components are identified as missing from the  undergraduate
              geography curriculum as currently implemented: 1) a  means of explicitly
              integrating the varied substantive material  covered in courses dealing with
              spatial analysis, cartography,  remote sensing, and geographic information
              systems; and 2) access  to the computer hardware and software needed to support
              integrated  instruction in these courses.  Accordingly, this project provides 
              undergraduate spatial analysis, cartography, remote sensing and  geographic
              information systems. These have been restructured around  common linkages and
              tie courses together. Both theoretical and  applied linkages are established,
              and computer hardware and  software are utilized. Also, laboratory exercises
              cross course  boundaries. A new capstone research course, recently added to the
               curriculum, now provides students with the opportunity to apply  spatial
              analytical techniques to research problems within various  sub-fields of
              geography.
