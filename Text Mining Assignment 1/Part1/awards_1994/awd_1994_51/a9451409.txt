Abstract    :
              9451409  Pastorek                                                  The new
              spectrofluorometric system will be used to demonstrate both  applied and
              fundamental applications of luminescence spectrometry  in undergraduate
              chemistry laboratory projects. This addition will  make it possible for us to
              offer our students more diverse choices  for open-ended special experiments
              dealing with the analysis of  real samples. For example, they may chose to
              analyze environmental  pollutants in natural waters, pigments in foods, and
              vitamins in  blood, for analytes that are not well suited for absorption 
              spectrometry. Students from applied chemistry areas, such as, food  science,
              pharmacy, and agriculture taking Instrumental Analysis  stand to gain a new
              regularly scheduled experiment that would  capture the flavor of a real sample
              analysis. Chemistry majors in  the "Integrated Laboratory" course will have the
              opportunity to use  a modern spectrometer fitted with a low temperature cell
              for the  study of the excitation, phosphorescence emission, and lifetime for  a
              variety of substituted benzophenones they have individually  synthesized in the
              laboratory.
