Abstract    :
              9451404  Wing  This proposal describes current revisions being made in the 
              laboratory portion of Biol 322 Genetics. The Genetics course is  required for
              all Biology majors. The enrollment in the Genetics  course has, over the past
              six years, been approximately 50% women  while our graduates over the same time
              period have been only 45%  women. The revisions being made in the Genetics lab
              are designed to  promote cooperative learning experiences which are frequently
              more  positive educational experiences for women than traditional  pedagogical
              methods. It is hoped that the combination of  cooperative and investigative lab
              experiences provided in the  Genetics lab will encourage more women to stay in
              the discipline of  Biology.     In order to give students the opportunity of
              working on projects  related to the area of molecular genetics, equipment in
              addition to  what is currently available in the department is required. Thus, 
              this proposal requests matching funds for the purchase of six  horizontal
              electrophoretic systems, six vertical electrophoretic  systems with appropriate
              power supplies, densitometer, and  transluminator. Also requested are three
              microcentrifuges, pipets,  incubators, water baths, and vortex mixers needed
              for the isolation  and preparation of samples for electrophoresis.
