Abstract    :
              9451522  Sprinsky                                The purpose of this project is
              to improve the curriculum for  students pursuing careers in Civil Engineering
              Technology.  Fundamental skill areas of land description and analysis and 
              surveying are strengthened by adding/enhancing instruction in  several
              essential competency areas, including (1) Non-line-of-site  Positioning: use of
              satellite technology to measure position of  land forms accurate to one part in
              one million; (2) Subdivision  design, land use analysis, transportation network
              design, and  environmental husbandry: significantly improved 
              synthesis/integration of data from multiple sources through  application of
              Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques; (3)  Line-of-site surveys and
              measurements: improved precision through  electronic distance measuring
              applications; and (4) Computer-based  engineering problem solution via
              application of interfaced  equipment networks and increased data base
              integration. Outcomes of  the project will strengthen significantly student
              knowledge of  state-of-the-art technology essential to meet effectively the 
              critical challenges of infrastructure development and utilization.
