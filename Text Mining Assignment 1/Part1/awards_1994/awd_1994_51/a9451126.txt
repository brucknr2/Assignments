Abstract    :
              9451126  Dural  This project will supplement the chemical engineering curriculum
              by  adding laboratory experiments which will expose the students to two  major
              areas: air pollution control and industrial waste water  purification. The
              first experiment will demonstrate removal of  volatile organic compounds from
              contaminated air by activated  carbon adsorption. A fixed bed adsorption unit
              currently being used  to demonstrate helium/nitrogen separation will be
              replaced with the  air pollution experiment, and modified to enable the removal
              of  multi component pollutant mixtures. The second experiment will  demonstrate
              renovation of industrial waste streams by reverse  osmosis. A pilot scale
              reverse osmosis system will be designed and  used to purify a simulated aqueous
              process stream containing a  mixture of contaminants. The system will permit
              the students to  examine the process variables such as applied pressure, feed 
              concentration, temperature, and feed flow rate on solute rejection  and water
              recovery while they are gaining hands-on experience with  a widely used waste
              treatment method.
