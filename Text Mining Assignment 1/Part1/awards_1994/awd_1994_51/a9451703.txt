Abstract    :
              9451703  Benton                                                    Eight sets of
              field measurement equipment are developed to be  available for loan to
              architecture departments across the country  for periods of up to one year.
              This equipment enables students to  gain first-hand experience in the
              instrumented investigation of the  physical environment of buildings and
              develop confidence in  physical measurement techniques. It is anticipated that
              the project  will lead to the participating schools' permanent acquisition of 
              field equipment, and to a broader acceptance in undergraduate  education of
              quantitative methods for the assessment of physical  building performance.
              Teaching materials have been developed to  support the field investigation of
              physical building performance,  and summer workshops are to be offered for
              faculty to learn how to  use these materials.
