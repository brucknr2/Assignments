Abstract    :
              9451338  Saxon                                                               A
              Mathematical Instructional/Explorations Laboratory is being  developed and
              implemented. The laboratory will be used to enhance  by making use of available
              electronic lecture notes and newly  created electronic notes with colorful
              text, video clips, dynamic  graphics, and motion made possible with hypertext
              and windows, and  then placing them in the lab for on-line student review; In 
              addition, laboratopy exercises are being developed that guide the  student in
              active learning experiences. In addition,students are  being assigned writing
              activities which focus on analysis of the  mathematics of the cooperative or
              independent lab experience,  metacognition, and the dynamics of group problem
              solving.
