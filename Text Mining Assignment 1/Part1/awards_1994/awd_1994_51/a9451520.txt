Abstract    :
              9451520  Lyon                                                     
              Image-sequence processing and image-sequence synthesis are the  enabling
              technologies for multi-media, HDTV, desk-top video,  interactive TV and
              computer animation.  The objective of this  proposal is to provide laboratory
              equipment for our developing  image-sequence processing and image-sequence
              synthesis courses.  These courses are closely aligned to the needs of industry
              and  address recent results as well as topics of current research. This 
              department believes that a knowledge of image-sequence processing  and
              image-sequence synthesis technologies provides a competitive  edge to students
              and industry.  The image-sequence processing and  image-sequence synthesis
              topics are dealt with in several  experiments, structured around the material
              presented in our  developing computer graphics and image processing courses. 
              These  experiments will give vital experience to our students, so that  they
              may have a significant societal impact by transferring these  technologies to
              industry in this and the next millennium.
