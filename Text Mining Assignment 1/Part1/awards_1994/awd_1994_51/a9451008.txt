Abstract    :
              9451008  Ben-Avi  A multipurpose multi-media systems laboratory with
              workstations  equipped with hardware to accommodate voice, video, audio and 
              direct digital inputs is developed. The workstations include  specialized
              co-processors for fast 2- and 3-dimensional and true  "stereo" real-time
              graphics and animation, and a slave DSP  co-processor. Using this high-level
              platform, students conduct  projects in graphics, animation, speech recognition
              and processing,  AI-based computer vision, digital and analog audio signal
              analysis,  and biomedical signal processing and analysis. The laboratory makes 
              possible free experimentation and the completion of more  sophisticated
              projects, concentrating on the application area,  without the need for months
              of low-level programming and debugging  of hardware - experiences which are
              amply addressed in other  courses. The multi-media laboratory enabled
              modernization of  existing courses and the introduction of a new design-based
              systems  course, "Multi-media Systems Design".
