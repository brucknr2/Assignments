Abstract    :
              9451425  Vogt  Incorporation of nuclear magnetic resonance into the
              undergraduate  curriculum will considerably enhance the training of
              undergraduates  at this institution with a high minority population. The 
              spectroscopic aspects will be introduced gradually. First, the  students will
              learn the theory. Then they will simulate the  workings of the nmr with
              programs available for Macintosh  computers. Subsequently, a trained
              upper-class chemistry major (or  minor) will demonstrate the running of the
              instrument for the labs  with nmr components (second semester of organic Lab).
              Finally, nmr  as part of the chemistry major will be taught as a component of a
               course in spectroscopy. Following training of one student by the  PI, students
              will be trained by their peers and enabled to run  their own spectra.
