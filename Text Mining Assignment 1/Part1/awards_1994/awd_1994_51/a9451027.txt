Abstract    :
              9451027  Chao                                 Psychology and other disciplines
              have faced criticism and sometimes  illegal activities directed at their use of
              vertebrate animals in  research. Reactions often involve new and more
              restrictive  guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals. Also, the 
              implementation of these guidelines and the increased measures  necessary to
              guard against vandalism require substantial  expenditures of scarce funds. This
              project therefore  supports an introductory undergraduate physiological
              psychology  laboratory which uses simple invertebrate preparations and 
              psychophysiological experiments. Basic computer equipment and  accessories are
              used. Demonstrations illustrate a variety of  neurophysiological phenomena, and
              undergraduates learn different  electrophysiological and psychophysiological
              techniques.  Given the continued controversy over the use of vertebrate animals
               in teaching and research, it is also expected that many departments  of
              psychology and biology will find this approach to the  undergraduate study of
              neuroscience valuable.
