Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a gas chromatography/mass 
              spectrometry system as an integral part of restructuring the  laboratory
              program.  This equipment is affecting laboratory courses  from the introductory
              chemistry sequence through the senior level  and is enhancing an expending
              undergraduate research program.   Students are individually gaining experience
              with complex micro-  analysis problems analogous to those encountered in
              industrial and  research laboratory environments.
