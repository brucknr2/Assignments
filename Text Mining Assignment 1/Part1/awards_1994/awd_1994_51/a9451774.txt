Abstract    :
              9451774  Brown  Current learning theory indicates that effective student
              learning  in the physical sciences can be greatly enhanced through the 
              creation of a learning environment that enables students to focus  on physical
              phenomena that are directly linked to useful  abstractions, to make predictions
              based on their conceptual models  which receive immediate interactive feedback,
              and to collaborate  with other students in making such predictions and
              discussing  unexpected results. The aim of the proposed project is to create 
              such a learning environment for physics laboratory instruction  through the use
              of a number of technological tools. Specifically,  the project will combine
              image processing and video capture  technologies to create motion and optics
              lab experiments which  enable students to link visual and graphical
              representations of  conceptual models with real-world phenomena. Students will
              view and  interact with live video images which are processed in real time to 
              enhance or measure important features. Students will also overlay  captured
              video images and clips with student-drawn interpretations  and predictions,
              image measurement tools, and graphics generated by  model simulations. This
              innovative project has numerous benefits  for students and the results will be
              widely disseminated to  community college and university physics and science
              instructors.
