Abstract    :
              This grant will provide superior instrumentation to educate  technicians for
              emerging high technology biology-based careers in  the manufacturing and
              production phase of the biotechnology  industry. The Biotechnology Associate in
              Science degree,  certificate and industry specific training programs offered by
              the  NH Technical Colleges/Institute are the only programs in the state  that
              will train technicians for entry level employment into the  biotechnology
              industry and for further education at four year  colleges in New Hampshire and
              other states. The contextual learning  that takes place in the cornerstone
              courses, Biotechnology  Experience I and II, will produce technicians that know
              how to  function in the biotechnology industry. The interactive multimedia 
              teaching and independent student learning laboratory will  facilitate the
              teaching and learning of conceptually difficult  aspects of the practice of
              biotechnology. The resource center  created by the very existence of the
              biotechnology facility located  at NH Technical College at Pease will connect
              students, educators,  government and bioindustry representatives interested in
              the  development of New Hampshire's and New England's biotechnology  industry
              and will help to nurture a seamless infrastructure which  will provide multiple
              entrances into and exits from education and  jobs in biotechnology.
