Abstract    :
              9451080  Beatty                                                    This proposal
              seeks funds to enrich the undergraduate neuroscience  laboratory experience at
              UCLA by extending current exercises and  experiments into the domain of the
              neuron and the genome. Two new  neuroscience laboratories -the
              Interdisciplinary Neuroscience  Laboratory and the Behavioral Neuroscience
              Laboratory -will benefit  from the grant. The requested instrumentation will
              give students  experience in intracellular microelectrode recording from
              cultured  Aplysia neurons, the source of much basic knowledge of neuronal 
              function; patch-clamp recording from PC-12 and N1E1-15 cells  studying ion
              channels and receptors; and restriction analysis of  DNA and DNA sequence
              analysis for identifying a series of clones  that are expressed primarily in
              the brain. Patch-clamp and  molecular biological methods will bc used together
              to study the  properties of expressed receptors, channels, pumps, and other 
              important membrane proteins in the Xenopus oocyte system. All these  exercises
              are at the forefront of contemporary neuroscience and  technically are well
              within the grasp of university undergraduates.  Both the departmental and the
              interdisciplinary neuroscience  laboratories are team taught, with each faculty
              member teaching a  module in his or her own area of expertise. Up to date 
              documentation and instructional material for all laboratory modules  will be
              made available to all colleges and universities over  Internet.
