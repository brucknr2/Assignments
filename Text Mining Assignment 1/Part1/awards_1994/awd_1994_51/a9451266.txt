Abstract    :
              9451266  Meints                                                    Macintosh LC
              III computers interfaced with the LabWorks data  acquisition and analysis
              system and various sensors will be used to  computerize the introductory
              chemistry and physics laboratories.  The implementation plan will affect
              students in all introductory  chemistry and physics courses for both science
              majors and  nonscience majors. The integrated package of computer, menu driven 
              data collection interface, spreadsheet program, and graphing  program will
              allow students to design their own experiments rather  than following the often
              "canned" procedures of the past. The  emphasis will be placed on the experiment
              and the interpretation of  data rather than on tedious data collection and
              calculation  allowing students to discover for themselves what relationships 
              exist between variables. Over a five year period more than 500  students will
              pass through these courses gaining a better  understanding of the process of
              science and how scientists actually  work in modern laboratories. Having the
              same system for both  chemistry and physics will allow students to use the
              experience  gained in their first science experience in future courses. This 
              early experience with computerized data acquisition and analysis  will prepare
              students for the more computer intensive upper  division courses which use
              computer controlled UV-Vis, FTIR, and  GCMS instruments and a CAChe molecular
              modeling system.
