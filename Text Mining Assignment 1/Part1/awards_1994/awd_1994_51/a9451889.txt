Abstract    :
              9451889  Trimble                                                   The
              objectives of this project are to give our students experience  with state of
              the art instrumentation and to increase their  familiarity with molecular
              biology and genetic manipulation. To  address these issues, we propose to equip
              our general biology  laboratory with six electrophoresis stations for the
              manipulation  of DNA restriction fragments, a microcentrifuge and incubator for
               DNA isolation and for transformation experiments. This equipment  would allow
              our students to conduct all of the basic types of  manipulations common in
              molecular biology. Students, in a series of  laboratories, will investigate and
              perform DNA isolations and the  recombinant DNA techniques of bacterial
              transformation and DNA  restriction enzyme digests. These laboratories will
              provide our  students with direct experience in the operation of experimental 
              instrumentation and in the performance of investigative  experiments. The
              laboratories will be performed in our biology  major courses, our non-major
              general biology courses and in  microbiology.
