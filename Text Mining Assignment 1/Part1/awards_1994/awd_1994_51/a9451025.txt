Abstract    :
              9451025  Luken                                             Tree-ring
              chronologies and related activities are used to focus of  two newly developed
              undergraduate laboratories. These chronologies,  in the form of cores,
              represent unique and readily available  long-term records of
              organism/environment interaction. One  laboratory for introductory biology
              requires students to measure a  series of tree-rings, relationships between
              ring-widths, and  climatic factors. The concepts of accuracy, precision, and
              variable  identification are also taught. Another laboratory in ecology 
              requires students to measure a series of tree-rings to determine  combinations
              of climatic factors that affect growth over periods of  time.
