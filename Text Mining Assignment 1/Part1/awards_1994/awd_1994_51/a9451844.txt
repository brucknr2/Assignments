Abstract    :
              9451844  Burtt                                  Understanding external and
              internal microstructure and its chemical  composition is essential to
              understanding the function and  development of biological and geological
              systems. A high  resolution, computer-driven scanning electron microscope with
              a  cryopreparation system and an X-ray Energy Dispersive Detector  provides a
              versatile teaching and research tool for undergraduates.  Cryopreparation
              eliminates hours of preparation time, which makes  the SEM usable by many
              students as part of laboratory exercises  associated with courses. The energy
              dispersive detector is vital to  analysis of chemical composition, which is
              important for geology  students who must determine mineral composition of
              samples and  biology students who may look at the chemical composition of 
              pesticides deposited on leaves. Students will use the SEM in the  laboratory
              portion of many courses, but it will also be an  important tool for student
              research, which is strongly encouraged.  Through lecture/demonstration,
              laboratory exercises, and student  research the project will impact 917
              students/year.
