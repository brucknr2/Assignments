Abstract    :
              9451359  MacWhinney  The laboratory microcomputer has become a crucial tool for 
              conducting experiments in psychology. This project therefore  supports the
              deployment of a computer program, called PsyScope,  that will remove this
              technological barrier. A national prototype  is being developed for the use of
              this program as the backbone for  the teaching of Research Methodology in
              Psychology. Construction of  this prototype involves completion of (1) an
              introductory manual,  (2) a series of standard experiment types, and (3) the
              building of  tools for linking experimental design to statistical analysis 
              programs. Working through a consortium of universities and  colleges, we plan
              to disseminate this prototype throughout the  nation. It is also expected that
              successful deployment of this  system nationwide will lead to a major
              improvement in the research  training of the future generation of experimental
              psychologists.
