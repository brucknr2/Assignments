Abstract    :
              9451673  Schauer                              An "interdisciplinary" inorganic
              synthesis laboratory is being  developed in the Chemistry department at the
              University of North  Carolina at Chapel Hill that will cover a broad range of
              topics  including solid-state chemistry, polymer chemistry, materials 
              chemistry, main-group chemistry, organometallic chemistry, and  coordination
              chemistry. An effort has been made to design several  experiments around recent
              research developments to give students  the flavor of modern inorganic
              chemistry. This proposal requests  funds to purchase a 200 MHz Fourier
              Transform Nuclear Magnetic  Resonance spectrometer that will be utilized
              extensively for  characterization of reaction products in this laboratory. This
               laboratory is a required course for all chemistry majors (taken by  80-100
              students per year), and will serve as a vehicle for the  education of our
              majors on the topic of Multinuclear FT-NMR  Spectroscopy. To handle the large
              numbers of students involved in  our program, the NMR spectrometer will be
              equipped with an  automatic sample loader, automation software, and a quad
              probe that  will provide routine access to 1H, 31P, l9F, and 13C spectra.
              Although  student involvement in routine data acquisition with this  instrument
              will be minimal, the students will be intimately  involved in working-up their
              own data in the 30-station Chemistry  Department personal computer laboratory.
              The program that we are  establishing will serve as a model for bringing modern
              NMR  spectroscopy into other programs with similarly large numbers of 
              chemistry majors. Furthermore, this same instrumentation will be  used to
              enhance the educational experiences of students in other  laboratories where
              the numbers are reasonably small, including the  honors organic laboratory, the
              polymer synthesis laboratory, and  the advanced organic synthesis laboratory.
