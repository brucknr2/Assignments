Abstract    :

              State University will introduce computer data  acquisition into its scientific
              electronics laboratory course.   This course is required of physics majors and
              is also popular with  students from other academic departments who need to know
              how to  use electronics in their work.  Currently, the laboratory teaches 
              basic analog electronics, operational amplifiers, digital  electronics, and
              analog to digital interfacing.  However, the  equipment now used for the course
              is not current, and methods of  computer data acquisition and control need to
              be taught in order to  prepare students for the way experimental physics is now
              done.  As  well as its use in teaching computer techniques, the equipment will 
              be used as a diagnostic tool which the students can use to  elucidate aspects
              of circuit behavior.  This will allow the  students to have a better
              understanding of how the lecture and  laboratory parts of the course relate to
              each other.  Each station  will be equipped with a Macintosh computer, LABVIEW
              data  acquisition software, and a computer-controlled multimeter, digital 
              oscilloscope, and function generator.
