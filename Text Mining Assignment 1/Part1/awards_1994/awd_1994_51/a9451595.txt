Abstract    :
              9451595  Linder                                                    This proposal
              requests matching funds to purchase a liquid  scintillation counter to be used
              in undergraduate biochemistry  laboratories and in undergraduate research at
              California State  University, Fullerton (CSUF). The biochemistry laboratory
              serves an  active and growing B.S., Biochemistry degree program. The 
              instrument will be used to implement a new experiment measuring  rates of
              protein turnover in cultured cells under a variety of  conditions in the
              biochemistry laboratory. This experiment has been  carefully designed to 1)
              teach students the theory and practice of  radioisotope handling and detection,
              2) provide an interesting and  challenging laboratory experience, 3) enable
              students to perform  standard computations and corrections associated with the
              use of  multiple isotopes, quenching, and isotope dilution, and 4) convey 
              procedures and practices associated with safe handling and disposal  of
              radioisotopes. The requested instrumentation will also be used  extensively by
              students in active undergraduate research programs.  Research is an essential
              component of the educational process at  CSUF and has been highly successful by
              a number of criteria  including publications co-authored by students and entry
              of  students into graduate programs in the sciences.
