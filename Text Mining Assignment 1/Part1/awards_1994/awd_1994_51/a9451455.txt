Abstract    :
              9451455  DiBartolomeis  Through two courses in molecular biology and genetics
              followed by  independent research, undergraduate students are getting a
              thorough  background in techniques commonly used in molecular biology and the 
              practical knowledge of how to apply these methodologies for working  through
              long-term laboratory projects.  An inquiry based mode of  approach is
              emphasized throughout.
