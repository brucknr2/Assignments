Abstract    :
              9451716  Chaderjian  Scripps College is creating a new mathematics department to
               specifically meet the needs of its students. A selective liberal  arts college
              for women, Scripps is one of the five undergraduate  colleges in Claremont.
              Because of an open cross-registration policy  among the Claremont Colleges,
              Scripps students have always had  access to mathematics courses taught at the
              other colleges. Over  the past decade the College has grown in the areas of the
              social  and physical sciences. This change in emphasis has created an 
              increased need for mathematics courses specifically for Scripps  students. In
              response to this need, the College created a new  mathematics department. The
              College is committed to the notion that  the knowledge of mathematics is
              increasingly important in our  society, and is dedicated to encouraging women
              to pursue studies in  mathematics.  Matching funds are provided by a grant from
              the Ralph  M. Parsons Foundation.
