Abstract    :
              Traditionally, software engineers have produced software products  and then
              passed them on to technical writers and other support  staff who worked on the
              information necessary to familiarize the  end users with the software. Now,
              however, market pressures have  forced software developers to tailor their
              products to a specific  and well-defined niche market, deliver them in far less
              time, and  with far fewer defects than before. In such a market, neither 
              technical writers nor software engineers can afford the  traditional, serial
              development process. A team of planners,  developers, testers, writers, and
              marketing specialists must  cooperate and collaborate in parallel in order to
              meet these  stringent market demands. To succeed, technical writers must follow
               the lead of their counterparts in companies like IBM and Microsoft  and
              contribute to the development team before the system is  delivered.  The
              Information Management in Software Engineering  course seeks to enable students
              to become information managers who  not only contribute to the final product by
              shaping the way it  communicates with its audience but also who develop,
              manage, and  disseminate information the team needs to move forward in its 
              process of creating high-quality software.  A key element in moving  technical
              writing from the serial-development paradigm to the  parallel-
              cooperative-collaborative paradigm is the equipment we  request which allows
              writers to manage the large volume of  information generated by a software
              team, transform that  information into resources for the development team and 
              instructional material for the end user, and to deliver that  information far
              faster than the traditional print technology will  allow.
