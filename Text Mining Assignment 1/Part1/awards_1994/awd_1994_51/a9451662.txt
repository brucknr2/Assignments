Abstract    :
              9451662  Beyermann  This project will develop an advanced physics teaching
              laboratory  at the upper-division undergraduate level.  This laboratory, which 
              represents an extension of the teaching laboratories now offered by  the
              department, will have four experiments in condensed-matter,  nuclear, and
              elementary-particle physics.  The experiments that  will be developed are
              Pulsed Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Josephson  Effect and Superconducting
              Quantum Interface, Rutherford  Scattering, and Cosmic-Ray Muon Lifetime and
              Michel Spectrum  Measurement.  These experiments are advanced and versatile
              enough  to allow creative exploration of physical phenomena by the students 
              and instructor.
