Abstract    :
              9451972  Stone  Grinnell College is breaking down the barrier between lecture
              and  laboratory in four fundamental courses that affect mathematics,  computer
              science, and science majors: multivariable calculus,  linear algebra,
              introductory programming, and introductory  statistics. Instead of fixed-length
              labs in a separate laboratory  room, they are weaving variable-length
              "mini-labs" into the fabric  of lectures and discussion in a blended
              laboratory/classroom. This  innovation makes it possible to integrate the
              laboratory experience  more thoroughly with the theoretical content of the
              course, to  strengthen the impact of this experience through in-class analysis 
              and discussion immediately following the laboratory, and to  position labs more
              flexibly, providing the experience just when the  students need it.  The
              hardware for such in-class integrated  laboratory experiences supports quick
              access to software by many  student users simultaneously, an easy-to-use
              graphic interface  providing multiple large windows, high-quality color
              graphics and  animations, clear display of large data sets and matrices, and 
              access to large application packages. In the design for evaluating  and
              disseminating the mini-lab materials that they are developing,  they are
              building on their experiences as leaders and contributors  in several projects
              with national impact -- projects in which they  designed, evaluated, and
              disseminated innovative course materials.
