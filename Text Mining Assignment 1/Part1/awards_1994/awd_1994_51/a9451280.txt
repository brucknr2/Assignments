Abstract    :
              9451280  McHenry                                                   This project
              aims to upgrade and modernize the undergraduate  laboratories for instruction
              in materials science and engineering.  In particular, the new equipment is used
              in the development of two  new superconductivity laboratory experiments, and
              also a  demonstration with emphasis on producing high temperature oxide 
              superconductors of current interest. The laboratories are  structured so as to
              emphasize synthesis and processing of ceramic  materials while demonstrating
              novel superconducting properties. The  laboratory equipment impacts upon the
              students' ability to  synthesize state of the art materials as well as to
              characterize  their structural and superconducting properties.
