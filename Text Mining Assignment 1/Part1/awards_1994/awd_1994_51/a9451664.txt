Abstract    :
              9451664  Miller                                                    The
              curriculum in the Anatomy and Physiology (A&P) laboratory will  be improved by
              the introduction of computers into the laboratory.   We have had considerable
              success in revising our curriculum to  encourage student-driven inquiry, which
              will be enhanced by this  equipment. The target audience for this project
              consists of A&P  students, 90 percent of whom are women preparing for careers
              in the  health fields. Most of these students are academically  under-prepared,
              lack self-confidence, and are intimidated by  science. Computer applications
              will be extremely useful in helping  students to overcome such obstacles. The
              hardware and software to  be purchased under this grant will enable students to
              engage in  hands-on experimentation, analyze data more effectively, work 
              collaboratively, and use a multi-media form of the human body to  deepen their
              understanding of human anatomy. This project will  demonstrate that the careful
              and systematic incorporation of new  technologies into the laboratory can have
              significant positive  impact in raising the level of scientific understanding
              and  achievement on the part of often-disadvantaged community college 
              students.
