Abstract    :
              9451978  Kantardjieff                                              The Chemistry
              and Biochemistry department and the Physics  department at California State
              University, Fullerton will establish  jointly an active learning instructional
              computer facility that can  be used to explore models and data in the upper
              division chemistry  and physics curriculum. The project will involve several
              core  courses that would facilitate student introduction to computer data 
              analysis and modeling and reduce lecture time. This is a  cooperative endeavor
              that will serve a significant segment of  students across disciplinary lines.
              The project will develop from  pilot studies already underway to consider the
              methods of  exploratory learning.
