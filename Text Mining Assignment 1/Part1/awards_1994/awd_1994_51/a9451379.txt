Abstract    :
              9451379                                                             Dahlberg    
                                                                  The department of chemistry
              at Lebanon Valley College will      enhance and strengthen instruction in the
              theory and applications  of all three forms of vibrational spectroscopy through
              the creation  of a Vibrational Spectroscopy Center. This center will be based
              on  a Perkin-Elmer System 2000 MIR, NIR, NIR-Raman Fourier Transfer 
              Spectrometer. We shall collect and develop a set of experiments  designed to
              instruct students on all aspects of modern vibrational  spectroscopy throughout
              their undergraduate education. As freshmen,  students will learn how to use MIR
              to  determine the identity of an  unknown. In organic chemistry, they will
              learn to interpret both  MIR and Raman spectra and underst and the advantages
              of each  technique in structure elucidation.     Experiments in physical 
              chemistry will instruct them on the theoretical and physical  origins of all
              three forms of         vibrational spectroscopy,  while our course on
              instrumental     analysis will expose them to  the use of NIR to predict a
              physic al property of a substance,  i.e., the octane of gasoline. The power of
              Raman spectroscopy  applied to biological systems will be  demonstrated in a
              study of  bilayers in our biochemistry        laboratory. Finally, students 
              will apply these experiences to  eal-life problems through their  undergraduate
              research.
