Abstract    :
              9451362  Lerman  Columbia College is equipping a laboratory with computer
              animation  and video editing equipment necessary to train students in the 
              interdisciplinary field between science, visualization, and  communication.
              These students obtain a strong background in  science, computer animation and
              video production, enabling them to  create and capture a visual perspective of
              science, and to create  video models showing scientific processes such as
              chemical  reactions, heat transfer, digestion, fission and fusion. These 
              broadcast quality videos are ideally suited for dissemination among  science
              teachers at all levels.  The Institute for Science  Education and Science
              Communication has been working for three  years in collaboration with Columbia
              College's Academic Computing,  Television, and Film/Video departments on the
              development of a  program in Science Visualization and Communication.  Students
               concentrate in this area under other majors.  The development of  this
              laboratory is a crucial step in Columbia's development of this  degree program.
                The program addresses the problem stated by Nobel  Laureate Roald Hoffmann on
              the difficulties in producing good video  programs in science because of the
              lack of a common language  between scientists and communicators.
