Abstract    :
              The Department of Biology at Emory University is developing a  laboratory course
              in experimental developmental biology that  follows a "project lab" pedagogy.
              The innovative project lab  concept extends well beyond traditional lab formats
              that may  accompany courses in developmental biology. Project labs immerse 
              students in a realistic research lab atmosphere, where they design,  perform
              and analyze their own long-term experiments. Funding will  enable purchase of
              inverted phase microscopes, incubators, and  tools for molecular biology
              techniques of the lab.
