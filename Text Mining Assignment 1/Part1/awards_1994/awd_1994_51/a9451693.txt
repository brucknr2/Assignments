Abstract    :
              9451693  Boatman                                                  Support is
              requested for the purchase of biotechnology equipment in  order to improve the
              Biology program at Hollins College. This  equipment will allow us to modernize
              the laboratory for our  Genetics course and to introduce a new Molecular
              Genetics  Laboratory. It will also allow us to use polymerase chain reaction 
              experiments in courses and undergraduate research in the Biology  and
              Biochemistry programs at Hollins College.  The Biology and  Chemistry
              Departments have long and successful records of preparing  students for
              graduate study in biology, biochemistry, medicine and  related fields. This
              success is due in part to our strong emphasis  on undergraduate research. We
              are well equipped in many areas, but  our lack of sufficient modern equipment
              for biotechnology results  in serious deficiencies in our program. In order to
              provide our  students with instruction and research experience at a high 
              experimental level, we need to secure equipment for nucleic acid  manipulation.
              Acquisition of this equipment will allow our students  to gain experience with
              techniques that are central to biology,  biochemistry and molecular biology.
