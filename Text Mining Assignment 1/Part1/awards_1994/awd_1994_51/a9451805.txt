Abstract    :
              9451805  Easwaran                                                  Faculty in
              the Department of Mathematics are establishing a  computer laboratory to teach
              linear algebra and numerical analysis.   The computer laboratory is designed to
              radically change the current  mode of instruction and the assessment of
              learning in these  courses.  The project is developing innovative ways of using
               symbolic computational software in instruction and significantly  enhance
              student understanding of basic ideas. Under this project,  the software Derive
              is used extensively to teach linear algebra and  numerical analysis. The
              built-in utilities of Derive as well as  those written by students and teachers
              is used for all the work in  these courses.  Courses are project oriented and
              require  cooperative learning; student assessment is changed radically to 
              reflect the new emphases.  The laboratory is being equipped with 20  networked
              Intel-486 based PCs and software to augment the 8  existing PCs in the
              mathematics department's computer laboratory.   Dissemination of newly
              developed utilities, on-line instruction  manuals, and student projects is
              through anonymous ftp.  Discussion  over the internet is used to modify and
              improve the project and the  materials produced.  An extensive evaluation also
              is used for these  purposes.
