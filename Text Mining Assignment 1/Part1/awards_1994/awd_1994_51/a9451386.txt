Abstract    :
              9451386  Norgard                              New undergraduate electromagnetic
              (EM) laboratory experiments are  developed to improve student understanding of
              the basic principles  of radiation, propagation and coupling taught in a new
              course on  electromagnetic interference (EMI) and electromagnetic 
              compatibility (EMC). Students actively participate in experiments  conducted in
              a large, broadband anechoic chamber with automated,  computer-controlled
              equipment. These experiments graphically  illustrate EMI effects and EMC
              measurement techniques. Industry  participation is a significant aspect of this
              project.
