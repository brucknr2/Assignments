Abstract    :
              Increased numbers of chemistry majors seek courses and research  with biological
              applications. The Department of Chemistry is  responding by actively
              demonstrating the fundamental role of  chemical principles in many life science
              applications by increasing  the exposure of undergraduates to the chemical
              basis of selected  biological phenomena.  This project presents physical
              chemistry  laboratory students with key techniques used in studying the 
              physical behavior and properties of biological macromolecules.   Fluorescence
              spectroscopy allows examinination of biological  systems from a physical
              chemistry perspective. The initial set of  experiments being introduced include
              fluorescence anisotropy  measurements to yield membrane micro-viscosity, a
              steady-state  fluorescence quenching study of the kinetics of protein 
              denaturation, and an investigation of the thermodynamics of  formation of
              several B-cyclodextrin inclusion complexes. These  curricular revisions are
              serving as an introduction to elements of  biophysical chemistry for all
              chemistry majors.
