Abstract    :
              9451860  King                                                      The goals of
              this project are:  To demonstrate the applicability of  expert systems to
              engineering education; and  to improve the  efficiency of the electrical
              engineering laboratory instruction.   Use of an expert system  enables the
              students to conduct more of  their own troubleshooting. Students do not have to
              wait for  assistance. They are able to query the expert system and receive 
              guidance as the need arises, even during non-laboratory hours. The  result is
              an increased opportunity for student/faculty discussions  of more advanced
              concepts and methods of system design and  development.  Usually, the
              laboratory instructor  spends most of  the laboratory period with just one or
              two of the lab groups  assisting them with troubleshooting tasks. The expert
              system   allows the professor to service more of the students during the lab 
              period because it  copes with the routine tasks. The expert system   continues
              to "learn" symptoms and solutions, always providing  complete "recall" of
              troubleshooting suggestions, even for new  faculty and laboratory teaching
              assistants who  teach the course  for the first time.  Innovative use is made
              of computers and an  expert system to assist electrical and computer
              engineering faculty  by providing certain of the routine functions encountered
              in the  microprocessor-based systems design laboratory. This application of 
              expert systems to engineering education will be carefully evaluated  to confirm
              its value as a "teaching assistant".
