Abstract    :
              9451970  Garcia  The acquisition of superspeed refrigerated centrifuges and an 
              ultracentrifuge upgrades the undergraduate biochemistry laboratory  program for
              B.S. biochemistry and B.A. chemistry majors.  The  curriculum has been expanded
              to include the isolation of  subcellular organelles by differential
              centrifugation, the  purification of plasmid DNA by CsCl density gradient 
              ultracentrifugation, and the separation of different classes of  serum
              lipoproteins by single vertical spin density gradient  ultracentrifugation.
