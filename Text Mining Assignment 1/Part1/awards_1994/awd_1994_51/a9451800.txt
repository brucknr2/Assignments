Abstract    :
              Bioengineering and catalysis are important aspects of chemical  reaction
              engineering education. Problems associated with the  maintentance of
              biocultures have prevented thee introduction of  bioreactors into chemical
              engineering lab courses. Similarly, the  high temperatures and pressures
              coupled with student safety  concerns have prevented the widespread use of
              catalytic reactor  systems for student laboratories. This project will develop
              an  immobilized enzyme bioreactor that will allow students to  thoroughly study
              both bioengineering and catalysis systems without  the problems associated with
              conventional reactor systems. The  resulting process will be an inexpensively
              constructed apparatus  for illustration of the principles of chemical catalysis
              that can  be operated at near ambient temperatures and pressures. Student 
              interest will be maintained since the reactor system is based on a  proven
              industrial process. This option for study of catalytic  bioreactors may not
              have occurred to many chemical engineering  departments. Thus, when the results
              of this project are presented  and published, there will be a significant
              positive impact on the  chemical engineering laboratory curriculum nationwide.
