Abstract    :
              9451148  Glick                                This project is establishing a
              laboratory in the area of  bioremediation. Bioremediation involves the use of
              living organisms  to reduce the concentration of environmental pollutants in 
              contaminated soils and wetlands. It is also a relatively new field  which
              presents excellent opportunities to impart new concepts and  laboratory
              techniques to undergraduate students.    A series of experiments is being
              developed, beginning with site  assessment and concluding with the study of the
              most efficient  conditions under which bioremediation occurs. Students are 
              introduced to new concepts in both biology and chemistry courses.  The project
              also departs from traditional teaching in that it  illustrates the usefulness
              of microbes and their potential for  rehabilitating the environment. New areas
              of exploration provide  learning opportunities for undergraduates, and students
              will gain  practical experience in lab techniques using equipment which may 
              not have been available.
