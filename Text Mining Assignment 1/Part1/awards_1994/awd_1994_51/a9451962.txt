Abstract    :
              9451962  Kelly  Money is requested to purchase twelve microcomputers and six 
              printers to be installed in our General Inorganic Chemistry  laboratory.
              Interfacing experiments will be developed for that  laboratory in the inquiry
              (discovery) mode of laboratory  instruction using some of the special features
              of the Lotus 123  spreadsheet. Also, laboratory exercises using a database of
              the  properties of the elements and a molecular modeling program will be 
              developed.
