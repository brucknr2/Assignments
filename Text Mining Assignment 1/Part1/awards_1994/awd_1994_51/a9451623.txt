Abstract    :
              9451623  Hsu                                                       Currently,
              the Computer Science Department at San Francisco State  University provides
              facilities for graphics and animation, but does  not support music and audio
              processing. This project plans the  establishment of a computer music
              curriculum which addresses  existing student interest in computer music, and
              serves as a basic  building block towards an integrated multimedia-oriented 
              curriculum. In addition, outreach activities are planned to  disseminate
              information about the facility in the music and  artistic communities. The
              computer music facility attracts to the  discipline creative individuals who
              previously have been interested  in acquiring valuable technical skills, but
              have not found their  interest areas addressed in most traditional computer
              science  programs.
