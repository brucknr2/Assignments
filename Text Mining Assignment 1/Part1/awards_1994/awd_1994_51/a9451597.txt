Abstract    :
              9451597  Slough                                                    The project
              addresses the "brief" calculus course, which serves the  needs of students
              majoring in business, management, and the  biological and social sciences.
              Currently, the primary emphasis in  this course is placed on mechanical skills
              such as differentiation,  integration, and algebraic manipulations. However,
              the primary  emphasis should focus  Structured laboratory investigations, 
              coupled with a computer algebra system to assist with purely  mechanical
              aspects, are being developed so that the students will  focus more on the
              fundamental concepts of calculus and on the  development of high-level
              problem-solving skills.  Previously, this course was taught assuming that
              students did not  use computational tools beyond a calculator. As a result, it
              was  difficult for them to obtain numerical insight. However, ready  access to
              a computer algebra system allows new types of activities  to be used, providing
              a more rounded view of the subject  matter--including graphical, numerical, and
              analytical aspects.  Approximately 15 Maple worksheets are being developed.
              These  worksheets will be made available nationally through the  Interactive
              Mathematics Text Project and through internet services.
