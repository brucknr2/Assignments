Abstract    :
              9451098  Barber  In order to enhance the teaching of behavioral neuroscience in
              our Psychology curriculum, we propose  to acquire specific equipment items for
              introductory and methodology courses in Biological Psychology  and for student
              research in this field. The formal courses bring students up to date on basic
              findings,  theories, and techniques of Biological Psychology. Equipment
              requested for the Introductory course in  the sequence (Psychology 125) will
              facilitate a weekly demonstration component that provides video,  interactive
              computer, and hands-on experiences to enable students to visualize
              structure/function  relationships and to "see" anatomical and physiological
              terminology in an active context. The  Methodology course (Psychology 325)
              combines lectures and discussions with laboratory exercises.  Students
              ultimately perform a guided experiment on brain/behavior relationships, using
              equipment  provided by the grant. In this experiment, students examine (1) the
              normal physiological functioning of  brain structures implicated in learning
              and memory and (2) the ways these structures may affect learning  and memory.
              Students in the Methodology course also prepare a professional report of their
              experiment  and participate in co-producing a Laboratory Manual in Biological
              Psychology, to be used by future  student generations. Thus, they undertake a
              full range of scientist's activites, from the acquisition of  factual
              information, through the generation of new data, to dissemination of
              information into the  community of scientists.
