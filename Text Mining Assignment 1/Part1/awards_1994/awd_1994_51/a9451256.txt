Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is committed to introducing modern  instrumentation
              early and extensively throughout our curriculum,  with an emphasis on a
              hands-on approach for our undergraduate  students.  A 200 MHz NMR spectrometer
              and some computational  software for molecular modeling are being used in
              complementary  pedagogy, as well as in separate applications.  These
              acquisitions  are having a major impact upon modernization of our microscale 
              organic chemistry laboratory, as well as many of our undergraduate  research
              projects.  We also are introducing experiments involving  NMR into laboratories
              in physical chemistry, inorganic chemistry,  and biochemistry.
