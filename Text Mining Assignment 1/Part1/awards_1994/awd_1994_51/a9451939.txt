Abstract    :
              9451939  Juricic  This project will develop a national model for the
              lower-division  CAD/CAM (Computer-Aided Design and Manufacturing) laboratories
              that  will replace present CADD (Computer-Aided Drafting) laboratories  for
              teaching Engineering Design Graphics (EDG) courses.  The  laboratory should
              provide a model means of attracting and retaining  engineering students.  The
              lab software and hardware, appropriate  for lower-division students, will be
              identified and integrated,  exercises will be developed and documented, and
              instructor's notes  and tutorials for lab development will be written. In
              addition to  the two PIs that will lead this project, six leading EDG educators
               will form an Advisory Committee, and as many as 25 other EDG  educators will
              participate as consultants in evaluation and  classroom testing of
              instructional material developed. The EDG  educators represent a variety of
              institutions-- 2-year, 4-year, and  doctoral; additionally many of the
              participating institutions have  large minority populations.  A group of
              practicing engineers from  six industrial organizations will provide much
              needed input from  industry.  The CAD/CAM based Engineering Design Graphics 
              laboratories proposed herewith will impact on a large number of  students,
              perhaps up to 280,000 degreed engineers and nearly an  equal number of two-year
              college graduates during the expected 5-  year lifetime of the new laboratory.
