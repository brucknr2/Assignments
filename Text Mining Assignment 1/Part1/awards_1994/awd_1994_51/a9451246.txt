Abstract    :
              9451246  Turner  A 1-meter optical spectrograph will be acquired, which will
              enable  students in our advanced physics laboratory to conduct three new 
              experiments: (1) a high-resolution study of the spectra of hydrogen  and
              deuterium, and use of these data to determine the mass of the  deuteron and the
              effects of spin-orbit coupling, (2) a study of the  Zeeman effect in Hg, and
              (3) a study of the continuous and  absorption spectra of the sun and of the
              absorption spectrum of the  earth's atmosphere, and use of these data to
              investigate the  Doppler shift and how it can be used to determine the radius
              of and  distance to the sun.  These projects, which are modeled after ones  at
              Middlebury College and MIT, will supplement and complement  existing exercises
              in the areas of electronics and atomic and  nuclear physics.  Data will be
              analyzed and visualized using the  department's NSF-funded computational
              physics laboratory.
