Abstract    :
              9451172  Johnson                                                            
              This proposal requests funding for an Electro-Magnetic Interference  (EMI)
              emissions apparatus. The requested laboratory equipment will  provide practical
              experience in measuring EMI emissions from design  projects constructed by
              students in the Electrical Engineering  Technology program. The analysis of
              data obtained from the  measurements will lead to examples of corrective action
              required in  a product development and manufacturing environment. This project 
              will serve as a national model for integration of EMI measurements  into
              Electrical Engineering Technology programs. The project  addresses a need to
              provide engineering technology students with an  awareness of environmental
              issues and to engage them in finding  solutions to the problems.
