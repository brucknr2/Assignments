Abstract    :
              9451804  Alauddin                             The project will purchase a
              state-of-the-art atomic absorption  spectrophotometer.  The introduction of new
              laboratory experiments  will facilitate student understanding of this
              technology and its  broad application in all fields of materials analysis. The 
              undergraduate analytical chemistry curriculum will be enhanced by 
              incorporating the spectrophotometer into the laboratory courses of  Inorganic
              and Theoretical Chemistry, Quantitative Analysis and  Instrumental Analysis for
              majors and Physical Science for  non-majors. In addition, this acquisition will
              significantly  enhance the undergraduate research capability. The 
              spectrophotometer will provide hands-on training for students. It  will also
              afford a number of capabilities which are not available  to them at present,
              such as, calibration, background correction,  data storage, editing, reporting
              and software control. Students  will use the equipment for trace element
              analysis of soil, water,  rocks and hair samples. Having performed these
              analyses the  students will be made aware of practical application of the 
              technique in chemical industries and research laboratories in  solving problems
              of environmental, biological and geological  significance. The project will
              provide a wide variety of student  experiences which will emphasize operation
              and application of the  instrument.
