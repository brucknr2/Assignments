Abstract    :
              9451102  West                                 Acquisition of the electrochemical
              station will allow an expansion  and upgrading of the chemistry instructional
              program. This proposal  requests modern electrochemistry equipment for use in
              the following  undergraduate laboratories: Quantitative Analysis, Instrumental 
              Techniques, Thermodynamics, Kinetics, and Independent Study.  The  instrument
              will be used to determine vitamin C, lead, and/or  cadmium in student-provided
              samples in quantitative analysis. We  view this instrument as a tool to
              stimulate, excite and draw bright  students into careers in science. In
              Instrumental Techniques, the  electrochemistry equipment will be used to
              demonstrate how cyclic  voltammetry can be used both quantitatively to
              determine an unknown  concentration of acetaminophen in a Tylenol tablet, and 
              qualitatively to obtain mechanistic information on the oxidation of  the drug.
              In the Thermodynamics Lab, it will be used to determine  thermodynamic
              properties and their relationship to structural  change, pH, solvent
              composition, and temperature. In the Kinetics  Lab, it will be used to study
              the kinetics of many different  reactions, for example the oxidation of
              benzoin. As time is  available outside of the formal courses, the instrument
              will be  used by students doing various independent research projects.
