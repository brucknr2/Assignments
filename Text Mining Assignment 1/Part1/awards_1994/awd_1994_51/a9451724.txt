Abstract    :
              9451724  Burkhardt                                                 Thermal
              analysis experiments are being incorporated into all levels  of the offered
              curriculum including general chemistry. The greatest  impact is in the polymer
              chemistry laboratory which is currently  being redesigned; however, analytical
              chemistry, physical  chemistry, and undergraduate research are also benefitting
              from the  new equipment.
