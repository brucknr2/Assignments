Abstract    :
              The Telecommunications Laboratory is a multi-use state-of-the-art  undergraduate
              teaching facility designed to be both flexible and  powerful. The controlled
              workstation and computer communications  facilities allow undergraduate
              students an opportunity to apply and  integrate classroom knowledge in
              communications, signal processing,  computer architecture, and algorithm and
              software development via  a set of practical experiments. Students are exposed
              to  state-of-the-art computer communications systems, on which they can 
              implement everything from modern digital communication and signal  processing
              algorithms to parallel algorithms and real-time  databases. State-of-the-art
              computer software provides the  undergraduate students modern models of quality
              software, as well  as allows them to design and build sophisticated
              software/hardware  systems. This laboratory  significantly impacts many of the 
              University of Oklahoma undergraduate students in both the School of  Computer
              Science and the School of Electrical Engineering. Many of  these students will
              take positions with organizations in the  telecommunications/ computer
              industry, where these skills and  experiences will be greatly valued.
