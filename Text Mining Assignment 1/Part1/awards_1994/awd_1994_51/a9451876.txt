Abstract    :
              9451876  Brown  Connecticut College has been given a grant from the Olin
              Foundation  to construct a new science center that will have an observatory on 
              the roof.  We are requesting funds to equip this observatory with  a new
              telescope and modern instruments.  We would like to obtain a  research-grade 20
              inch telescope, a CCD camera, a spectrometer and  a computer workstation in
              order to provide better opportunities for  student research in astronomy and
              astrophysics as well as improve  our introductory astronomy sequence.  The
              introduction of this new  equipment will significantly enhance the department's
              major in  astrophysics and minor in astronomy, as students would be able to 
              engage in a wider variety of research projects using modern  apparatus than
              previously possible.  We currently use a  hundred-year-old Clark refractor for
              both teaching, labs, and  research projects.  Students, instead of dealing with
              science  questions and doing astronomy, spend a great deal of time adapting 
              the Clark to work with 20th century equipment and expectations. The  new
              telescope will be the focal point of the observatory and  astronomy program and
              will greatly contribute to the new prominence  that has recently been given to
              astronomy at the college.
