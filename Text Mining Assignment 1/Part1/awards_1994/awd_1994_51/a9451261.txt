Abstract    :
              9451261  Richards                                                          A
              digital audio signal processing laboratory is developed  consisting of four
              networked workstations equipped with specialized  hardware and software for the
              acquisition, processing, storage, and  playback of high-quality audio signals.
              The workstations are  equipped with object oriented software development tools
              for  efficient construction of substantial signal processing  applications.
              This equipment is used to provide an extensive  laboratory experience as part
              of a senior level course in  non-stationary signal processing that focuses on
              speech signals.   At the core of the proposed course is a semester-long
              software  development project with small interdisciplinary design teams 
              consisting of engineering students, voice science students and  faculty from
              outside the engineering department. Each team  identifies needs of the speech
              scientist that can be met through a  software solution, and then designs,
              implements and tests an  application program to meet these needs. Software
              development takes  advantage of the efficient techniques of object oriented 
              programming for modularity, thereby allowing future work to easily  build on
              past accomplishments and facilitating dissemination of the  results. The
              student-designed signal processing objects are  collected in a library for use
              in future projects and available to  other schools through the INTERNET.
