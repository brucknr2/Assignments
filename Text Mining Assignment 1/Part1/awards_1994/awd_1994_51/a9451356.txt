Abstract    :
              9451356  Monce  This project will replace the ion accelerator at Connecticut 
              College and enhance the associated instructional activities.  The  new
              accelerator will enable the revitalization of a senior-level  experimental
              physics course, permit accelerator-based experiments  to be introduced into the
              sophomore-junior laboratories, and find  applications in introductory physics
              as well.  The accelerator will  also enhance the opportunities for student
              research projects by  allowing experiments in a wider energy range and using a
              greater  variety of beams, as well as opening up new areas of inquiry such  as
              surface physics.  Finally, the new accelerator will allow us to  engage in
              interdisciplinary work with anthropology and biology in  the x-ray analysis of
              materials.
