Abstract    :
              9451818  Pani  The teaching component of an environmental and earth sciences 
              laboratory is being developed by the Department of Geosciences at  Northeast
              Louisiana University.  State and matching private funds  are being provided for
              the research and community-service  components. The learning center serves as a
              unique undergraduate  teaching facility in which meteorological, geological and
               geographical studies are integrated and co-located with the  resources needed
              to analyze and display information and to  visualize major elements of
              ecosystems.  It expands a research  laboratory combining a modern system for
              acquisition, storage, and  analysis of meteorological data with a geographical
              information  system.  Through the learning center, exciting improvements in 
              undergraduate education occur as new exercises using actual  situations
              involving both majors and non-majors in the discovery  process.  This helps the
              students to better understand basic  scientific principles, visualize abstract
              concepts, and consider  new data types such as those produced by Doppler
              radars.
