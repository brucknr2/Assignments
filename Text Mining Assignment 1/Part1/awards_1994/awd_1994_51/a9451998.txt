Abstract    :
              This project aims to develop an undergraduate computing laboratory  to support
              the expansion of a 2-year pre-engineering program to 4-  year baccalaureate
              programs in mechanical, electrical, and  manufacturing engineering. The project
              involves the implementation  of Unix-based workstation computing in a 
              laboratory, which  influences all the lower and upper level courses. The lower
              level  courses involve extensive research paper and laboratory report  writing.
              The upper level courses involve specialized software such  as: Mathcad, Maple
              V, Auto CAD, CAE Tools, SIMSCRIPT, ALGOR and  others.  The industrial-type 
              workstations are ideal for such  software. The following courses are being
              directly impacted by the  computing laboratory: for all majors, the Senior
              Design Project;  for mechanical engineering majors, Mechanical Engineering
              Analysis,  Heat Transfer and Theory of Machines; for electrical engineering 
              majors, Engineering Laboratory, Digital Systems; and for  manufacturing
              engineering majors, Manufacturing processes,  Computer- Aided Design and
              Manufacturing, and Facilities Design and  Materials Handling.
