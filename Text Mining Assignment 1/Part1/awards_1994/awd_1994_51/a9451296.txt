Abstract    :
              9451296  Diwan  The nation's industrial sectors are reiterating the fact that 
              product quality, reliability and cost containment must be  vigorously pursued
              if the United States will continue to be the  world's technological leader, and
              also remain competitive in the  market place. This has reawakened a new
              emphasis on engineering  education geared towards design and production. This
              project  proposes to enhance the manufacturing laboratory and curriculum of 
              Southern University at Baton Rouge, Louisiana by adding Computer  Numerically
              Controlled machines. The proposed equipment would  enable the faculty: to
              provide undergraduate students with quality  training opportunities and skills
              that reflect the technological  advances in the manufacturing industry; to
              develop new laboratory  courses in computer aided design and computer aided
              manufacturing  - CAD/CAM; to take a step further in developing a strong 
              manufacturing option for undergraduate Engineering and Technology  students as
              well as graduate students in computer science; to  strengthen the curriculum,
              offer students hands-on practical  experience, and a familiarity with equipment
              they will use in the  industry; and to enhance the capacity of Southern
              University to  contribute immensely towards the engineering and science 
              educational goals for minorities in Louisiana, and the United  States.
