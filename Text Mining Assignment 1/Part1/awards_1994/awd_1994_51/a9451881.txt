Abstract    :
              9451881  Mutel                                The University of Iowa has
              developed an innovative laboratory for  teaching undergraduate astronomy
              courses using CCD cameras, robotic  telescopes, and computer-based instruction.
               This project is  developing a new observing system combining CCD camera,
              telescope,  and filter control which is particularly well suited for use in 
              large non-science oriented laboratories. The system is designed to  allow the
              student to control the entire system using a simple,  well-designed graphical
              user interface. When combined with an  appropriate curriculum, this system can
              serve as a prototype for a  modest cost, commercially available package for
              teaching  observational astronomy at colleges and high schools throughout the 
              country.
