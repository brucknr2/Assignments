Abstract    :
              Ducharme  9451719  Optical technology has become an increasingly important
              component  of the education of every scientist and engineer. This is 
              particularly true for physicists. Moreover, lasers are  intrinsically
              attractive to undergraduates, who are often highly  motivated to build and
              apply them. We intend to capitalize on the  laser "magnet" by integrating
              modern optics and lasers into  advanced laboratories in need of intellectual
              rejuvenation, into  the undergraduate research program, and into a proposed new
               laboratory course which will feature experiments taken from the  forefront of
              optical physics and technology. The program is  structured to progressively
              implement sophisticated uses of lasers  and modern optical technologies, using
              them both as teaching tools  and as means of engaging student interest.  This
              project integrates into our advanced undergraduate  laboratories the research
              directions and expertise of three of our  newer faculty members, as well as
              current research interests in  other science and engineering departments, and
              research carried out  in several centers established at UNL by the state-funded
              Nebraska  Research Initiative. This program will offer our undergraduates the 
              opportunity to acquire concepts and techniques of optical physics  and
              technology that they will likely use in their careers. The new  laboratory
              course, "Physics of Lasers and Modern Optics," will  attract and serve students
              from other sciences and engineering as  well as physics majors.
