Abstract    :
              9451331  Cromartie  This project is using field monitoring equipment that is
              linked to  Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in a core curriculum for 
              undergraduate environmental studies at the institution. The  Environmental
              Studies Program (ENVL) offers a major which includes  geosciences,
              environmental chemistry, biological resources, and  management/planning. The
              recently revised basic courses include  physical geography, ecological
              principles, and environmental  issues. ENVL also plans to incorporate key
              developments in  instrumentation and data analysis into the curriculum. The
              most  important of these are GIS and the Global Positioning System  (GPS).It is
              also expected that this project will influence  undergraduate environmental
              studies at other colleges and  universities.
