Abstract    :
              9451110  Foos  This proposal request funding for an inductively coupled plasma
              spectrometer (ICP) and field equipment  necessary for collection of aqueous
              geochemical data for a geochemistry class research project. The  objective of
              the project is to increase undergraduate exposure to sophisticated analytical
              equipment and  provide them with a research experience within the context of a
              traditional geochemistry laboratory  course. The class research project will be
              integrated into a series of existing computer based laboratory  exercises. The
              class will develop a sampling plan, attend a field trip where they will collect
              samples plus  make on site measurements and they will analyze the samples for
              major, minor and trace elements in the  laboratory. Students will incorporate
              these data into exercises on data quality, graphical presentation of  data,
              ionic strength, ionic activity, carbonate equilibrium, Eh-pH diagrams and
              WATEQ4F. The final  results of the project will be presented by the students as
              a poster at a regional scientific meeting. The  first year of the program the
              students will determine the water quality at Silver Creek Metro Park  (Summit
              Co Ohio). The objective of the study will be to determine if acid mine seeps of
              a reclaimed strip  mine, within the park, adversely effect the quality of
              surface water.
