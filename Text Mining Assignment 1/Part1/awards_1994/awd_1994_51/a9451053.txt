Abstract    :
              9451053  Juhl  This project introduces students from two technician education 
              programs to gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) through an 
              interdisciplinary environmental monitoring project. In a  collaborative study
              of the Henrys Fork of the Snake River, Chemical  Laboratory Technician and
              Hazardous Materials Technician students  analyzes water samples for various
              organic and inorganic constit-  uents using GC/MS, Ion Chromatography (IC), wet
              chemistry  techniques, and field testing equipment. The project requires 
              groups of students to create objectives, identify and implement  procedures,
              follow protocols standard to industry and the  Environmental Protection Agency
              (EPA), and report analyses to  certain state and conservation agencies. The
              GC/MS is used to  determine the presence of specific pesticides and volatile
              organic  compounds in the river due to heavy agriculture in the river's 
              drainage. Availability of a GC/MS allows authentic environmental  monitoring
              following EPA guidelines, acquaints students with a  critical analytical tool
              routinely used in industry, introduces  computer operated instrumentation, and
              provides experience with  data base searching and quantitative software. The
              collaborative  nature of the project also provides students unique
              opportunities  such as supervising and teaching colleagues in a closely related
               field and interacting with professional organizations.
