Abstract    :
              9451438  Goldfeather                                               Graphics IRIS
              Crimson/VGXT, two Silicon Graphics INDY workstations,  and a Sony videocassette
              recorder equip an improved and expanded 3D  Computer Graphics Laboratory
              (housed in the newly constructed  Center for Mathematics and Computing). This
              graphics laboratory  supports the present computer graphics course as well as 
              independent study in computer graphics. The course focuses on the  foundations
              of modern computer graphics, with an emphasis on the  mathematics, physics, and
              computer science theories needed to  render raster images. Students progress
              from simple pixel-by-pixel  calculations to a final project involving realistic
              3D images. The  predominant independent study project, known as Carl3D, is a 
              student-written 3D graphics environment which can create, display  and
              manipulate images in a wide variety of formats. Students use  the advanced
              features of the graphics system to create  visualization tools for other
              students and faculty, with a  particular emphasis on animation.
