Abstract    :
              9451132  Heidcamp  A computer network for cell biology laboratory instruction is
              being  established.  The network will contain laboratory exercises  designed
              for three levels of activity.  Level I contains exercises  designed for minimal
              equipment and budget.  Level II is consistent  with curricula placing a high
              value on hands-on laboratory  experiences.  Level III will be advanced work
              leading to  independent studies or team research efforts.  The exercises are 
              written for standard cell biology laboratories or for inquiry-based  education.
               The network serves as a source of computer simulations  as well as data.  The
              data may be in the form of graphs, tables, or  images.  The network also serves
              as a communications device to link  teachers of cell biology from high schools,
              colleges and  universities.  It will also allow for instructor input and
              revision  of existing exercises.
