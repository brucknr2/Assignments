Abstract    :
              9451171  Johnson                                                   A laboratory
              of microcomputers networked to a file server which is  equipped with
              mathematics and statistics software is used by  undergraduate students in both
              mathematics courses and courses in  other undergraduate areas through a
              comprehensive plan called  Mathematics Across the Curriculum.  The goal is to
              make the  learning and appreciation of mathematics a shared responsibility on 
              campus by enhancing the mathematics components of a wide range of  courses,
              especially in the core (or general education) curriculum.  The computer lab
              supports this effort as well as undergraduate  mathematics courses, including
              Calculus, Linear Algebra and  Differential Equations.  The initial reform of
              the mathematics  curriculum is the use of the Harvard Calculus Consortium
              materials  supported by the use of this computer laboratory.  The lab is 
              staffed and managed in a newly created Mathematics Center.  The  Director
              builds upon past experience and expertise in the uses of  technology in
              mathematics education. He works with faculty outside  the Mathematics
              Department to enhance the role of mathematics and  technology in their courses,
              assists students in coping with  mathematics-related assignments and helps to
              revise mathematics  courses.
