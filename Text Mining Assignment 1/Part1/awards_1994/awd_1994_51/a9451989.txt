Abstract    :
              9451989  Sweeney  Students develop abilities to think critically, analyze data,
              draw  conclusions and make decisions concerning the appropriateness of  the
              methodology as applied to the solution of problems related to  separation of
              proteins.  During group projects utilizing the  automated system to
              chromatographically purify a series of ricin A  proteins (differing
              structurally in 1 or a few amino acids), the  relationship between the
              physical/chemical nature of the molecules  and their chromatographic behavior
              is elucidated. The students are  also introduced to basic chromatographic
              principles as they are  applied to protein purification.  Students who complete
               Quantitative Biology during their junior year are qualified to  participate in
              the undergraduate research restricted elective  during summer and/or senior
              year.
