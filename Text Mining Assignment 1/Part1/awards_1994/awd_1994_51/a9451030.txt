Abstract    :
              9451030  Pladziewicz                                               This project
              will complete a revision of the laboratory work in  general chemistry and the
              incorporation of a sophomore-level  inorganic chemistry course into the
              curriculum of chemistry majors.  The goals of these changes are to: (1) involve
              students in  constructing thoughtful technical reports earlier in their 
              laboratory work, (2) increase the inorganic content in the  curriculum of
              majors early in their program of study, (3) modernize  the synthetic methods
              and characterization techniques used by  students in the first two years of
              their chemistry program by the  incorporation of high-quality microscale
              synthetic glassware and  modern instrumentation into the laboratory work
              associated with  these courses, and (4) provide additional equipment for 
              characterization and study of inorganic materials prepared in  undergraduate
              research projects.
