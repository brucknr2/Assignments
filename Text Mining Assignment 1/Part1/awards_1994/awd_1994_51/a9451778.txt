Abstract    :
              9451778  Erevelles  A Flexible Assembly Cell (FAC) is developed for the Computer
               Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) Laboratory at GMI through the  efforts of an
              industry-assisted inter-departmental team. This  state-of-the-art assembly cell
              provides an experiential learning  environment to support the core senior level
              CIM course. FAC seeks  to challenge students by providing an environment with
              automated,  instrumented, vision assisted, quasi-intelligent integrated 
              assembly capability. This environment provides the opportunity for  students to
              explore a variety of aspects of CIM through structured  experiments, with ample
              opportunities for further exploration. An  Adept One robot, controller, vision
              system, hand exchanger,  overload and compliance devices, and various grippers
              serve as the  primary work center of the cell. Allen Bradley sensors, 
              programmable logic controller, and associated hardware and device  drivers,
              along with a Worthington Auto ID package, enable the  collection of data used
              to control the assembly process.  Integration of these equipments into the
              existing CIM laboratory is  accomplished using 486-based PCs. Assorted
              instrumented PHD  pneumatic cylinders allow the construction of tooling
              required to  support the assembly process.
