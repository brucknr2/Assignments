Abstract    :
              9451351  Rothman                    This project will give undergraduate
              students in the field of  communicative disorders an opportunity for hands-on
              experience with  the most modern scientific equipment used in the investigation
              of  normal and disordered speech production. The acquisition of the  following
              equipment allows the project to achieve this goal: the  Computerized Speech Lab
              allows analysis of the complex acoustic  information in speech, clarifying the
              speech production and  perception theories presented in lectures. The existing
              equipment  of linearized magnetometers provide the students with information 
              concerning the coordinated movements of the respiratory system. The 
              pneumotachograph setup allows measurements of airflow patterns  within the
              vocal tract, yielding valuable information about the  activity of the vocal
              folds during voicing. All of these  instruments will be used for instructor
              demonstrations and student  experiments during laboratory course sections
              accompanying each of  the undergraduate speech science lecture sections offered
              in the  department. By bringing students into a scientific environment  where
              they become active participants, this project opens the door  to a greater
              appreciation for the role of science in the service of  individuals with
              communicative disorders.
