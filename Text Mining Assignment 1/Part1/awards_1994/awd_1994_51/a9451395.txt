Abstract    :
              9451395  Endres                                                  A pulsed laser
              system will be used to upgrade several upper level  chemistry laboratories.
              This is a very versatile system which  demonstrates modern techniques in
              spectroscopy and allows a wide  range of chemical and physical phenomena to be
              explored. A nitrogen  laser will provide very short ultraviolet light pulses
              suitable for  initiating spectroscopic and kinetics studies. The electronics
              will  permit students to follow process on the nanosecond and microsecond  time
              scale. A dye laser accessory extends the output throughout the  visible range.
              The primary use will be in an upper level integrated  Analytical-Physical
              Chemistry laboratory course. The students will  study the lifetime of excited
              states through fluorescence. They  will observe short lived reaction
              intermediates and will study the  kinetics of the quenching of fluorescence.
              The apparatus will  enhance current student work; for example, we will use
              Raman  spectra to complement the current Infrared spectroscopy module.  Several
              experiments are directed at areas of Materials Science  including time resolved
              studies of photoconductivity in  polyacetylene, the luminescence of microporous
              silicon, and the  study of quantum size effects in the fluorescence of metal
              sulfide  clusters.
