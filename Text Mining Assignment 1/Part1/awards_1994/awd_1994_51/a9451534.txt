Abstract    :
              9451534  Chen  To offer undergraduate students hands-on laboratory experience
              and  to improve laboratory instrumentation for better undergraduate  education
              in the field of Environmental Science, we will  incorporate Inductively Coupled
              Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectroscopy  (ICP-AES) into curricula and offer
              research opportunities to  undergraduate students. ICP-AES is the ideal choice
              for elemental  analysis for the majority of inorganic pollutants regulated by
              EPA  and OSHA.  The ICP-AES workstation will greatly enhance the  undergraduate
              laboratory experience for students learning  instrumental methods,
              environmental chemistry, toxicology of heavy  metals and fate of pollutants in
              the environment. Specific  experiments will be conducted to maximize the use of
              these  workstations and to increase instruction efficiency using new  teaching
              methods like cooperative learning groups and rotating  workstations. Analysis
              of pollutants in the atmosphere, soils,  waters and sediments will be covered,
              so ICP-AES may be used as an  investigative tool in research and result in
              scholarly works with  undergraduate coauthors. Since chemistry, biology and
              environmental  science students will take laboratory courses using these 
              workstations, the project will impact a significant number of  students.
