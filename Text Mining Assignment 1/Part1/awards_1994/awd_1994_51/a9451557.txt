Abstract    :
              9451557  Lawson  The Mathematics Department at Tulane University is integrating 
              computer use into its core applied mathematics and linear algebra  courses.
              These courses are fundamental to the science and  engineering curriculum. The
              applied math course is required for all  engineering and most science students,
              and the linear algebra  course is required for math majors and taken by many
              engineering  and science students. In both courses the role of the software is 
              to enhance understanding of the basic concepts. Students will be  able to use
              the software in subsequent science and engineering  courses and in the
              workplace. The applied math course uses phase  plane analysis to help students
              understand the qualitative behavior  of nonlinear systems arising from a
              variety of models. It also uses  Mathematica to allow symbolic and numerical
              analysis of  differential equations. The linear algebra course uses Mathematica
               and Matlab to achieve mastery of crucial algorithms such as LU, QR,  and
              singular value dicompositions as well as provide numerical and  symbolic
              exploration of motivating examples. Both classes will make  fundamental use of
              computing as an integral tool in each class  meeting, involving the students
              more actively in the course. Group  activities will play a key role in both
              classes. Dissemination will  occur through publications as well as
              presentations at conferences.
