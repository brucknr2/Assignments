Abstract    :
              The purchase of an ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer will  enable a series
              of laboratory exercises in courses ranging from  Crime Lab Chemistry to Modern
              Scientific Methods.  The exercises  will enable students both to learn
              laboratory skills and to design  independent research projects.  The Institute
              for Science Education  and Science Communication has a well established history
              of  training individuals in the media communication and teaching  professions.
              A significant proportion of these students are  minorities and women. The
              Institute for Science Education and  Science Communication sees as its mission
              the ongoing education of  the public in science through the education of
              Columbia College  communications and teaching degree program students. Students
              are  encouraged to incorporate their major fields of study, personal 
              interests, hobbies and cultural  backgrounds along with the use of
              state-of-the-art analytical  instrumentation in projects that may take the form
              of Paintings,  films, videos, dances, theatrical performances, poems,
              photoessays  or even sculptures.
