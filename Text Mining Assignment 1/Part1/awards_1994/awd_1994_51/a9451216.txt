Abstract    :
              9451216  Wheeler                                                  The project
              will acquire modern, computer-controlled voltammetric  and amperometric
              equipment to enable student exposure to  electrochemical principles and
              applications.  Initial development  will be in Analytical, Physical, Biological
              chemistry courses as  well as undergraduate research.  This will allow Furman
              to markedly  improve curriculum in the area of electrochemistry.  Further, the 
              simultaneous application of spectroscopic and chromatographic  methods will
              serve to amplify the distinct advantages and uses of  such techniques.
