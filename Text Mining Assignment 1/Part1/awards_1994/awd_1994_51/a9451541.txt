              9451541  Williams                                                  Enhanced
              instrumentation in spectrophotometry is used as a basis  for emphasizing
              quantitative laboratory investigation.  A number of laboratory classes
              including General Biology,  Oceanography, Cellular, Molecular and Developmental
              Biology,  Biochemistry and student Research classes incorporate use of diiode 
              array spectrophotometers.
