Abstract    :
              9451740  Schurr                                                    This project
              adds experiments in geophysical sensing to the  classroom, laboratory, and
              field school program in archaeology at  the institution. Equipment includes a
              geophysical surveying station  and instrumentation, with ancillary computer
              equipment and  software. The equipment is being used by undergraduates for 
              site-level geophysical surveys within the context of a  comprehensive program
              in archaeological theory, method, research,  and human landscape studies.
              Student activities involve course  lectures and specific field work, including
              geometric and soil  resistivity surveys, computer data processing, computerized
               mapping, and image processing. Students are also able to complete  class
              projects and term papers, or subsequently conduct independent  study research
              using the theoretical approaches or techniques  presented and learned in a
              course.
