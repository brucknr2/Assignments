Abstract    :
              9451312  Buckley                              This project is designed to
              increase our student's capability to  monitor physical and chemical parameters
              in the aquatic and marine  environments. The acquisition of water quality
              monitors and data  loggers permit students to simultaneously monitor various
              physical  and chemical parameters and profiles in aquatic and marine 
              environments. The continuous remote monitoring capability of these  instruments
              provides our students with greatly enhanced data sets  on seasonal changes
              and/or diurnal fluctuations in limnological  parameters of importance. Analysis
              of real data gives students a  greater understanding of limnological phenomena,
              and relevant  research experiences benefit all majors, whether going onto 
              graduate school, working in the environmental field, or teaching in  the public
              school.
