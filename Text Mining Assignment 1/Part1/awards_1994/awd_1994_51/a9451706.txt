Abstract    :
              9451706  Saboury                              The University, through strong
              support of industrial sponsors such  as McDonnel Douglas Corporation and
              Catepiller Inc, has obtained  material and financial support for an
              industrially relevant  polyermic composites laboratory.  The main objective of
              this project is to improve and augment the  materials laboratory equipment to
              provide hands-on experience in  the fields of design, processing and
              characterization of polymer-  matrix composites for the undergraduate students
              in the College of  Engineering and Technology.  This project will affect up to
              9 courses including junior-level  materials courses in manufacturing and
              mechanical engineering, a  senior project and technical elective courses. A new
              laboratory  instruction manual will be developed over a two-year period during 
              the implementation of the project.  Outreach activities are under development
              to involve pre-service  teachers in the materaials science course which is
              being enhanced.   Additionally, the laboratory will be opened to regular visits
              by  high school students, including a substantial number from  underrepresented
              minorities, from the local area and region.
