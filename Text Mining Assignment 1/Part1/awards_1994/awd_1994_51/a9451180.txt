Abstract    :
              9451180  Menezes  A computer algebra laboratory, consisting of Maple running on
              a  network of SUN workstations, is being created which will enhance an 
              undergraduate program in applied discrete mathematics.  Discrete  mathematics
              is an important subject for students in many  disciplines, and essential for
              students majoring in such fields as  applied mathematics, computer science,
              engineering and education.   A primary focus of the project will be on projects
              to illustrate  the contrasting nature of discrete and continuous problems.  
              Students will be able to experiment with realistic examples thereby  obtain a
              better understanding of the underlying mathematics.
