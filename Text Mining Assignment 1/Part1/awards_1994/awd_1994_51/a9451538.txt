Abstract    :
              9451538  Aghajanian  This project is establishing an Undergraduate Social
              Science  Teaching Laboratory to improve social science curriculum by: (1) 
              developing a math-science orientation, (2) exposing students to  social science
              data in critical and quantitative context, (3) and  using computer technology
              effectively in teaching social science  research. Undergraduate majors mainly
              from criminal Justice,  psychology, and sociology will benefit from this
              project. The  project will enhance learning opportunities for undergraduates. 
              Students will be expected to develop analytical models, and to test  their
              models using objective methods and statistical techniques.  The improvement of
              laboratory facilities will also enhance teaching  effectiveness, especially in
              such courses as social science  research methods, social statistics,
              demographics, and survey  measurement and analysis.
