Abstract    :
              9451627  Calle                                                     This project
              will acquire an Instructional Scanning Tunneling  Microscope, which will be
              used to strengthen and modernize the  advanced physics laboratory. The extreme
              magnification and  measurement resolution capability of the STM will permit the
               students to visualize surface atoms, perform experiments in atomic  structure,
              measure atomic dimensions, and study the surfaces and  defects of
              semiconductors. The STM will also be used in the second  semester of the
              traditional calculus-based physics course in class  demonstrations to allow the
              students to observe atomic surfaces and  perform a simple measurement
              experiment. We also plan to introduce  the instrument in our course for
              nonmajors, allowing the students  to observe atomic surfaces. Finally, our
              seniors will be able to  undertake research projects with the STM. The
              equipment will  strengthen and modernize our laboratory offerings at all levels
              and  will provide our students with exciting state-of-the-art  experiences.
