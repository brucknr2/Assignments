Abstract    :
              9451752  Wall                                                      This project
              supports instrumentation for an urban archaeological  initiative at the
              institution. The program introduces  undergraduates to the scientific method as
              it applies to problems  in urban archaeology. Unlike most undergraduate
              archaeological  programs, the program also engages undergraduates in the entire
               analytical process that results in archaeological interpretation.  The phases
              covered include formulating a research problem,  background historical study of
              a site, excavation, processing and  analyzing artifacts and field data, and
              applications of the  scientific method. The results of the students' work are
              also  incorporated into professional site reports.
