Abstract    :
              9451791  Budnik                                                    A new
              undergraduate laboratory course in neurosciences will expose  students to the
              fields of neuroanatomy and neural development, and  will emphasize recent
              advances in these two disciplines that have  resulted from genetic approaches.
              Students will be introduced to  state-of-the-art technologies that currently
              play such an important  role in neuroscience research. The main idea underlying
              this course  is to develop these techniques around interesting scientific 
              questions that will teach the students about the fundamental  organization of
              the CNS, and about the process of doing science.  This course will become one
              of the focal points for an  undergraduate neuroscience and behavior
              "concentration" within the  university. In recent years, the philosophy of life
              science  education at the University of Massachusetts is shifting from a 
              "textbook" science education for undergraduates to a more hands-on  approach. 
              The proposed laboratory course will be part of a more  extensive research
              experience for undergraduates. Our long range  goal is to create an integrated
              training curriculum that would  attract undergraduates to careers in biology in
              general and to  neuroscience in particular. The requested equipment will serve
              the  formal laboratory in one semester, will serve other courses in the 
              neuroscience concentration, and will be the center of an honors  laboratory and
              Research Experience for Undergraduates during the  summer and intersession.
