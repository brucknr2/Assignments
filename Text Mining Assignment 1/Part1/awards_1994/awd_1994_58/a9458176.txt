Abstract    :
              9458176  Ellington  In vitro selection techniques will be used to determine how 
              proteins containing arginine-rich motifs can specifically recognize  their
              cognate RNAs.  The possible sequence motifs available to both  RNA and protein
              partners of the interface will be scanned and an  attempt to identify `codes'
              for protein: nucleic acid interactions  determined.  %%%  Commonalities in the
              complementary interfaces formed by proteins  and nucleic acids are critical to
              understanding most life  processes.  In vitro genetic selections will be done
              in order to  determine what set of protein sequence motifs.  The range of 
              possible `answers' to the molecular recognition `problems' will be 
              investigated and improvements made, if possible.  ***
