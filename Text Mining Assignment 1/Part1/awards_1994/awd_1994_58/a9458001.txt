Abstract    :
                                                                                       
              Technical abstract: The focus of the research is to study the  effects  of 
              quantum  phenomena such as energy level quantization  and  single-  electron 
              charging on electronic transport in nanostructures.   It  is  proposed to
              utilize an atomic force microscope (AFM) with a conducting  tip to serve as a
              local electrostatic gate.  A voltage applied to this  tip will influence
              transport with a submicron resolution.  Some of the  systems to be studied with
              such a technique are chemically synthesized  arrays of metal and semiconductor
              clusters with diameters less than 10  nanometers.    These  studies  will  be 
              carried  out   at   cryogenic  temperatures.   Other  applications include
              local  magnetic  resonance  measurements  including  magnetic resonance 
              imaging  on  a  submicron  scale.    Non-technical abstract:  The focus of the
              research is to study effects  of   a  single  electron on the properties of
              extremely small,  atomic  sized,  devices.  It is proposed to utilize an atomic
              force microscope  (AFM) with a conducting tip to serve as a local electrostatic
              gate.  A  voltage  applied  to  this  tip  will  influence  transport   with  
              a  microscopic resolution.  Some of the systems to be studied with such a 
              technique are chemically synthesized arrays of metal and semiconductor 
              clusters  with diameters of tens of atoms. Other applications  include  local 
              magnetic resonance measurements on  scale of perhaps a thousand  atoms.
