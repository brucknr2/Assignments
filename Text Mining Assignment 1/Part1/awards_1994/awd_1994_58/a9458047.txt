Abstract    :
              9458047  Kouvetakis  The design and synthesis of new organic/inorganic materials
              that  are of value in microelectronics, optoelectronics, and ceramics is 
              proposed.  Emphasis is placed on precursor molecules that  incorporate the
              stoichiometry and structural architecture, and  having facile reaction pathways
              that lead to metastable and  equilibrium phases with potentially unique
              properties.  Our  intergrated approach involving synthetic chemistry, physical 
              chemistry, and chemical engineering is important to the development  of new CVD
              and solution polymerization processes.  %%%  ***
