Abstract    :
                                                                                       
              Technical  abstract: Materials and devices with very small  dimensions  but 
              larger  than  single  atoms  have recently  been  fabricated  and  studied.  
              Novel  effects  have  been discovered  in  these  so-called  mesoscopic
              systems.  In separate developments, recent advances in  the  understanding  of 
              disordered systems, critical  phenomena,  and  non-  linear  dynamics have made
              it possible and imperative  to  ask  deeper  questions  about complexity.  Our
              approach is to probe  model  complex  systems  such  as glasses and driven
              vortices in superconductors  with  novel  mesoscopic techniques.  In this way
              important phenomena can  be  directly studied for the first time.   
              Non-technical  abstract:   Materials  and  devices  with  very   small 
              dimensions  but larger than single atoms have recently been fabricated  and  
              studied.    Novel   effects  with   particular   importance   to 
              microelectronics  have been discovered in these  so-called  mesoscopic 
              systems.    In   separate  developments,  recent   advances   in   the 
              understanding  of such problems as turbulent flow and neural  networks  have 
              made  it  possible and imperative to ask deeper questions  about  complexity.  
              Our approach is to probe model complex systems  such  as  glasses and
              superconductors with novel mesoscopic techniques.
