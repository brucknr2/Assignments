Abstract    :
                                                                                       
              Technical abstract: The problems to be investigated include a study of  dc 
              Josephson junctions in superfluid helium 3 and their  use  in  the  development
               of  the superfluid macroscopic quantum gyroscope,  and  a  study  of two
              dimensional superfluid helium three, including a  search  for  third  sound.  A
              millikelvin scanning tunneling probe  microscope  will  be  built  for  study
              of quantization in nanostructures,  atomic  manipulation,  and  wavefunction 
              characterization.   Low  temperature  helium  four  atomic  beam  technology
              will be  developed  for  atomic  interference experiments.    Non-technical 
              abstract:  Ultra-low temperature  phenomena  provide  a  variety  of  unusual
              opportunities for the development  of   extremely  sensitive  detectors of
              various physical phenomena.  It is planned  to  study  several  such phenomena
              using very cold liquids such  a  helium  three  and helium four.  One device
              called the "superfluid macroscopic  quantum  gyroscope"  has  the potential
              sensitivity  to  measure  with  extremely   high   precision  the  Earth's 
              rotation   pertaining   to  geophysics. and climate change.  In another study a
              scanning tunneling  microscope    will  be  developed  which  can  operate  at 
               ultra-low  temperatures close to absolute zero.  Such an apparatus would find
              use  in   the   investigation  of  many  novel  phenomena  in  very   small 
              semiconductor structures.
