Abstract    :
              9458025  Wooley  A new approach towards the synthesis of uniquely functionalized
               macromolecular architectures will be undertaken.  Micellization  effects will
              be employed to organize amphiphilic block copolymers,  containing crosslinkable
              sites in one of the blocks, into a desired  conformational arrangement, which
              may be permanently fixed through  intramicellar crosslinking of the block
              copolymer micelles.  %%%  ***
