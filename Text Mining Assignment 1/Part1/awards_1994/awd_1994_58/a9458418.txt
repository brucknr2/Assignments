Abstract    :
              9458418  Bettison-Varga       Three tightly constrained research projects will
              include: 1)  characterization of phyllosilicates from the Middle Valley, Juan
              de  Fuca Ridge hydrothermal system to evaluate porosity/permeability  controls
              on their formation; 2) Pb and S isotope characterization  of epidosites and
              surrounding rocks from the Troodos ophiolite,  Cyprus to delineate fluid
              pathways that produced massive sulfide  deposits and evaluate isotopic
              heterogeneity of the lithosphere;  and 3) petrographic and geochemical study of
              volcanics in the Black  Mountains, Arizona to determine the relationships
              between  detachment faulting and volcanism.  Significant undergraduate 
              teaching will be incorporated in the career development plan, both  in
              introductory and advanced level courses.
