Abstract    :
              9458210  Weigel  The switch from vegetative to reproductive development is a
              critical transition in the life cycle of a flowering plant.  Despite its
              importance, the molecular mechanisms underlying this developmental switch are
              poorly understood.  Dr. Weigel has previously isolated a gene, LEAFY, that is
              the earliest known gene to be active in flowers of the small crucifer
              Arabidopsis, and whose activity is required for floral identity.  He proposes
              to use genetic and molecular approaches to decipher the genetic hierarchy that
              leads form floral induction to pattern formation within the flower, initially
              using the LEAFY gene as a main tool.  Specific questions that he will address
              include the following:  (1) How does floral induction lead to the activation of
              genes that determine floral identity? (2) Which genes, in addition to LEAFY,
              control floral identity?  How is the pattern or organ emergence in shoots and
              flowers regulated?  (4) Are the mechanisms uncovered in Arabidopsis conserved
              in other species of flowering plants?  %%%  This work seeks to investigate and
              identify molecular mechanisms underlying the switch from vegetative to
              reproductive development in the life cycle of a flowering plant.  Specific
              questions will be asked in Arabidopsis thaliana and, ultimately, in other
              flowering plants.  The answers to be obtained to those questions will lead to a
              mechanistic understanding of floral determination which will permit directed
              manipulation of flowering not only in Arabidopsis but also in other,
              economically important plants.  ***
