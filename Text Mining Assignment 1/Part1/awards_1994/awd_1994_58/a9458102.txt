Abstract    :
              9458102  Lockery    There is growing evidence that human behavior is strongly 
              influenced by genes.  Because many behavioral genes are  believed to exert
              their influence through the nervous  system, it is essential to understand how
              genes affect the  structure and function of individual neurons.  A promising 
              approach to this problem is to study how genes control the  behavior of simple
              animals.  In many ways, the tiny (1 mm  long) roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans
              is ideal for this  investigation:  the connectivity among its 302 nerve cells 
              is known completely; the neural circuits for its behaviors  have been
              identified; over 150 genes affecting behavior have  been found; and cloning a
              gene to determine its function is  easier than in almost any other animal.  The
              main objectives  of my research, therefore, are:  (1) to make 
              electrophysiological recordings from identified neurons in  C. elegans to
              determine how behavior is produced in normal  animals, and (2) to determine how
              genes affect the structure  and function of the nervous system in C. elegans by
               recording from identified neurons in behavioral mutants.  This research will
              deepen our understanding of the causes of  behavior in this increasingly
              important system and, because  C. elegans have homologs in mammals, it will
              very likely  expand our knowledge of the genetic basis of  behavior in  more
              complex organisms, including humans.
