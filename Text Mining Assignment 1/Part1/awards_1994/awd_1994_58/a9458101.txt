Abstract    :
              9458101  Berger-Sweeney    The proposed studies will examine mechanisms that
              underlie  sexual dimorphism of cerebral cortical structure and  cognitive
              functions in mice.  More specifically, the studies  will focus on how
              cortically-projecting neurons in the basal  forebrain (BF) influence the
              developing cortex and cognition  in the two sexes.  A BF lesion model will grow
              to adulthood.  Previous studies show that a neonatal BF lesion leads to 
              persistent alterations in cortical morphology and to  cognitive deficits in
              adulthood.  Recent studies show that  lesion-induced structural and functional
              deficits are more  pronounced in male than in female mice.  For the proposed 
              studies, a combination of neurochemical, anatomical and  behavioral methods
              will be used to examine mechanisms that  underlie these sex differences. 
              Critical questions to be  addressed include:  Does the BF influence cortical 
              maturation at different times in males and females?  What  neurotransmitters
              are responsible for morphological and  behavioral differences between the
              sexes?  Do gonadal  hormones differentially interact with the developing BF 
              system in the two sexes?  Answers to these questions will  provide exciting
              insights into how sex differences in  cortical maturation may relate to
              sex-specific cognitive  development.
