Abstract    :
              9458368  Zhang       Research projects include the following: 1) experimentally 
              simulate and theoretically model explosive volcanic eruptions; 2)  examine the
              equilibrium and kinetics of the interconversion  reaction between OH groups and
              water molecules, and apply the data  to volcanic glasses; and 3) set up more
              experimental facilities,  measure "water" solubility and diffusivity in
              nominally anhydrous  mantle minerals, and study diffusion in silicates. 
              Teaching goals  are to restructure the Earth Sciences curriculum and improve 
              undergraduate interest and enrollment in Earth Sciences.  This P.I.  will
              develop courses for the new curriculum, including computer-  simulation
              experimental projects for the classroom.
