Abstract    :
              9458061  Schadler    Micromechanics problems critical to the failure of
              composite  materials are examined.  Laser Raman Spectroscopy (LRS), which can 
              measure strain and phase changes with 2 micron spatial resolution,  and x-ray
              stress analysis are the primarily tools used.    Hydroxyapatite (HA), a ceramic
              material present in teeth and bones,  is inherently brittle and, as a man-made
              material, is limited to  nonstructural applications.  Using LRS, the toughening
              of HA with  zirconia is studied and the transformation zone mapped as a 
              function of load, exposure to physiological solutions, and volume  fraction of
              zirconia.  Aqueous and organic environments are known  to decrease the
              mechanical properties of graphite/epoxy composites.   Degradation of the
              interface during exposure is a primary mechanism  of composite failure.  LRS is
              employed to monitor the integrity of  the interface as a function of solvent
              polarity, temperature and  time.  In pursuit of computer-aided instruction
              techniques,  appropriate hardware and software will be developed for use in 
              polymer education.  %%%  This research should assist in the development of
              composite systems  for structural applications.  ***
