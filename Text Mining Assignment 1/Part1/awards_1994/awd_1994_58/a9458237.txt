Abstract    :
              9458237  Baldwin   Molecular phylogenetic analysis of chloroplast and ribosomal
              DNA sequence variation in the California and Hawaiian Madiinae (Asteraceae) is
              proposed.  Published hypotheses of adaptive radiation in the California
              Islands, speciation modes, dispersal mechanisms, and chromosomal/morphological
              evolution would be tested.  This research would revisit classic biosystematic
              examples from a new perspective.
