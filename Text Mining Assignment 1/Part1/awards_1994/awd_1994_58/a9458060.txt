Abstract    :
              9458060  Ade  X-ray microscopy studies with chemical and orientational 
              sensitivity will be performed on a range of polymer samples  important to
              industry.  These include, but are not limited to, 
              methylene-diphenyl-diisocyanate and tuluene-diisocyanate based  polyurethane
              foams (Dow Chemical), various fibers such as Kevlar  and Nylon (DuPont), as
              well as polyimide thin films (DuPont).  We  propose improvements in spatial
              resolution towards 10 nm and the  addition of Auger, secondary yield and
              fluorescent yield detection  modes of absorption spectromicroscopy.  %%%  ***
