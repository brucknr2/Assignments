Abstract    :
              9458114  Sanderson    Suspension-feeding fishes filter massive volumes of water
              to  extract small prey particles.  Although they comprise one  third of the
              world fish harvest, their mechanisms of  particle retention are unknown. 
              Hypotheses about the  process of particle encounter with the filtering
              apparatus  and the process of particle retention inside the oral cavity  have
              rarely been tested in suspension-feeding fishes.  The  P.I. will use novel
              techniques to test hypotheses about the  filtration mechanisms of species that
              differ in morphology  and water transport method.
