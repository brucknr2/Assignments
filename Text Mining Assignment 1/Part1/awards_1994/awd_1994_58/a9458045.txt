Abstract    :
                                                                                       
              Technical  abstract:   Research will  be  conducted  in  the  area  of 
              magnetic  nanostructures, including ultrathin films,  multilayers  and 
              granular   structures.   The  effect  of  non-magnetic  or   polarized 
              overlayers  and  doped  interfaces  on  magnetic  anisotropy,   domain 
              structure   and   magneto-transport  properties  of  ultrathin   films 
              fabricated   by  sputtering  and  molecular  beam  epitaxi   will   be 
              investigated.   Further,  the  use of granular  films  for  electrical 
              injection, spin-dependent scattering and modification of the thin-film  domain
              structure will be explored.    Non-technical abstract:  Research will be
              conducted to investigate the  magnetic and electrical properties of materials
              comprised of nanometer-  thick   films   and  nanometer-size  particles.  
              Films  and   layered  structures  will  be fabricated by ultra-high vacuum
              vapor  deposition  and  evaporation.   The  role  of the interfaces  in 
              determining  the  magnetic reversal and electron transport characteristics of
              the  films  will  be  explored.  Potential applications of this  research 
              include  magnetic recording, novel memory devices and magnetic field sensors.
