Abstract    :
              9458405  Bercovici       Unifying the theories of plate tectonics and mantle
              dynamics  is a major goal in geodynamics.  This goal is impeded by the fact 
              that plate tectonics treats plate margins as discontinuous, while  mantle-flow
              models employ continuum mechanics.  This research  project proposes to develop
              a continuum model of plate tectonics  that incorporates finite plate-margin
              widths and intraplate  deformation.  Significant undergraduate and graduate
              teaching will  be incorporated in the career development plan.
