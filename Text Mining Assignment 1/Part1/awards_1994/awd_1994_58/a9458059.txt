Abstract    :
                                                   Technical abstract: An experimental
              investigation will be carried  out  of  low  temperature transport in
              mesoscopic semiconductor structures.  Particular  attention  will  be placed 
              on  exploring  the  connection  between  randomness  in  quantum transport and
              quantum  signatures  of  classical chaos.  Applications include the use of
              feedback control  of  phase-coherent  transport for the purpose of developing 
              semiconductor  quantum dots to operate as low-noise magnetometers.   
              Nontechnical  abstract:   The focus of the research is  to  understand  the 
              physics  which  governs  the motion of  electrons  in  ultrasmall  devices.  
              Recent results indicate that when the electrons can  travel  distances   larger
               than  the  device  dimension  without  appreciable  scattering  by impurities
              and other defects then the geometry  of  the  device  becomes  a  significant
              factor in determining  the  electron's  motion.   This sensitivity to geometry
              can be a useful tool  to  study  the  underlying mechanisms of chaotic motion
              and to ultimately  design  new  devices.   The  proposed research will  be 
              carried  out  at  low  cryogenic   temperatures  and  in  very  high  quality  
              semiconductor  structures to increase the mobility of the electrons.  :
