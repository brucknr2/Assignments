Abstract    :
              9458111  Povinelli  This award provides support to Dr. Daniel Povinelli under
              the  National Science Foundation's Young Investigator Awards program.   The
              objective of this program is to recognize outstanding young  faculty in science
              and engineering, to enhance the academic  career of recent PhD recipients by
              providing flexible support for  research and educational activities, and to
              foster contact and  cooperation between academia, industry, and institutions
              that  support research and education.  Dr. Povinelli has already made 
              significant research contributions to the field of physical  anthropology, and
              he has the potential to become a leader in  academic research and education.   
              This award will allow the investigator to build on his existing  research on
              self-awareness and to undertake series of studies of  chimpanzees and young
              children's understanding of agency,  intention, and knowledge and belief, in
              both themselves and  others.  The research holds promise of making considerable
               progress toward constraining our interpretations of the  psychology
              underpinning complex social behavior in chimpanzees.   Furthermore, it will
              allow a determination of the extent of  overlap in human and chimpanzee
              cognitive development related to  mental state attribution.  This will allow
              evolutionary  biologists to produce more precise reconstructions of the 
              primitive cognitive features of the great ape-human clade, as  well as a
              determination of the more derived features of human  cognition.
