Abstract    :
              9458018  Soboyejo    The program explores the use of cutting edge materials
              science and  micromechanics concepts in the microstructural design of high 
              temperature intermetallic alloys and composites.  The research  involves the
              application of fundamental knowledge derived from  basic studies of materials
              structure, processing, and failure  mechanisms, in the design of inorganic
              materials for high  temperature structural applications.  The systems studied
              include;  in-situ titanium-matrix composites produced by rapid solidification 
              and ingot metallurgy techniques; twin-toughened gamma-based  titanium aluminide
              intermetallics produced by ingot and powder  metallurgy techniques; and
              synergistically toughened nickel  aluminide composites produced by dry phase
              blending and spray  forming techniques.  After processing, very detailed
              studies of  composite structure and failure mechanisms are carried out on 
              composites with different microstructural size scales.  Systematic  experiments
              and micromechanics analyses are performed to  investigate the effects of
              crack-tip shielding mechanisms on  composite mechanical properties.  %%%  The
              knowledge derived from these studies will be used to guide the  development of
              practical concepts for the design of damage tolerant  composites with different
              microstructural size scales.  ***
