Abstract    :
              9458005  Rohrer    Specifically, ultrahigh vacuum and ambient pressure scanning 
              tunneling microscopy will be used together with other surface  analysis
              methods, atomistic models, and image simulations to study  the surface
              structure of the molybdenum and vanadium oxides that  are used as partial
              oxidation catalysts.  Of particular interest is  the evolution of the surface
              defect structure during reduction and  oxidation reactions and the interaction
              of hydrocarbons with the  surface.  this award will simultaneously support the
              Principal  Investigator's efforts to develop multimedia educational tools for 
              use by educators and students in Materials departments.  The goal  is to
              develop interactive programs, accompanied by explanatory text  and graphics,
              that illustrate fundamental concepts in Material  Science and Engineering (such
              as crystallography and diffraction)  through graphic simulations.    %%%    The
              objective of the research supported by this award is to  determine the surface
              structure of catalytically active ceramic  materials in order to establish
              surface structure-property  relationships that can be used for the development
              of advanced  materials.  The Principal Investigator also plans to develop 
              multimedia educational tools for use by educators and students in  materials
              departments.  ***
