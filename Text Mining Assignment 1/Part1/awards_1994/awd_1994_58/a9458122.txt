Abstract    :
              9458122  Arcese    This work will address the ecological and evolutionary basis 
              of individual variation in reproductive and aggressive  behavior using two
              long-term observational and experimental  studies of song sparrows (a North
              American passerine) and  oribi (an African antelope).  The goals of this work
              include  (1) development of oribi and song sparrows as model species  for
              research linking fundamental issues in empirical and  theoretical ecology with
              applied problems in wildlife  management and conservation; (2) the development
              and  application of fecal steroid assays for the non-invasive  monitoring of
              reproductive condition wild ungulates, and  single-locus DNA fingerprinting for
              studies of the  demographic impacts of inbreeding in small populations; and 
              (3) to use this and related work in computer modelling to  develop a new
              undergraduate course in Applied Behavioral  Ecology.  Expected benefits of the
              work include the  development of a predictive framework for assessing the 
              impacts of population genetic structure and demography on  vertebrate behavior,
              and the improved application of  molecular genetic and endocrinological
              techniques for non  invasive field research.
