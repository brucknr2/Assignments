Abstract    :
              9458376  Rojstaczer       This research project will examine the interaction
              between  subsurface fluid flow and crustal deformation in areas of active 
              volcanism and faulting.  The work is designed to aid in  understanding the
              episodic nature of permeability and to use  hydrology as a tool to define the
              earthquake and geothermal cycle  in a region.  Teaching goals include: 1)
              developing an outstanding  graduate program in hydrogeology, 2) organizing an 
              interdisciplinary program in hydrology, and 3) teaching  undergraduates that
              science, and earth science in particular, is an  exciting field of study that
              has real world applications.
