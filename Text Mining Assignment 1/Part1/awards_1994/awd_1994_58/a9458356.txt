Abstract    :
              94598356  Thompson    This NYI award is to support LuAnne Thompson to undertake
              various  process studies of isolated dynamical features (fronts and deep 
              western boundary currents), the kinematics and dynamics of the  western
              equatorial Atlantic and interannual variability in the  tropical ocean
              circulation. Many of her new research areas are more  physically oriented than
              theoretical. She has demonstrated her  ability as a teacher by receiving a
              Danforth Distinction for  Teaching award while she was at MIT. She also taught
              seminars as   a post-doctoral fellow, and she has clearly defined her teaching 
              plan for the University of Washington.
