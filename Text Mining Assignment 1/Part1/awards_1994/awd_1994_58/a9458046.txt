Abstract    :
              9458046 Ringel  Research will be directed toward an improved  understanding of
              the electronic properties of dislocations in  lattice mismatched semiconductor
              heterostructures, their  relationship with dislocation microstructure, and an
              exploration of  methods to electrically passivate the deleterious nature of 
              dislocations.  The effects of impurities and extrinsic processes  such as those
              encountered for specific device applications, will be  considered in detail. 
              The focus is on three technologically  important semiconductor systems,
              III-V/Silicon,  Germanium-Silicon/Silicon and nitride based wide bandgap III-V 
              materials.  The proposed research incorporates a unique array of  complementary
              electronic, microstructural, and atomic resolution  measurement techniques, in
              addition to epitaxial growth and  processing facilities to perform the proposed
              studies.  This  research will make fundamental contributions to the materials 
              science of dislocations in semiconductor heterostructures from an  electronic
              perspective which, coupled with an improved  understanding of dislocation
              control, will have significant impact  on integration of lattice mismatched
              electronic materials for  advanced device applications. %%%%%% This research is
              expected to  provide improved fundamental understanding of the electronic 
              properties of defects resulting from the monolithic integration of  dissimilar
              semiconducting materials, and to investigate methods to  control the
              undesirable properties of these defects.  The results  will be of importance to
              the development of multi-functional  devices and integrated optoelectronics
              that consist of different  classes of materials integrated onto a common
              substrate. An  important feature of this research project is the training of 
              graduate and undergraduate students in a fundamentally and  technologically
              significant area of materials and processing  research.  ***
