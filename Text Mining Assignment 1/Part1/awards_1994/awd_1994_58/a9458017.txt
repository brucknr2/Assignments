Abstract    :
              9458017  Grey  Adsorption sites for monomethylamine and pyridine on acidic 
              zeolites, and for hydroflourocarbons on basic zeolites, will be  probed using
              double and triple resonance MAS NMR experiments.   Distances between nuclei at
              surface sites and on the adsorbed  molecules will be measured in order to
              determine the structure of  the adsorbate/adsorbent complexes.  %%%  ***
