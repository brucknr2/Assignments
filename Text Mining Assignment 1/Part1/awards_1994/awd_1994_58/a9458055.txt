Abstract    :
              9458055  Teraoka  Enhanced partitioning fractionation of polydisperse polymers
              using  porous materials recently proposed by the nominee is expected to  have a
              high preparative capability.  He will study solution  thermodynamics in the
              fractionation as well as statics and dynamics  of polymer chains in a confining
              porous medium.  %%%  ***
