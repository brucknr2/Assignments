Abstract    :
              9458350  Geller      This NYI award is to support Jonathan Geller's research on
              Marine  Biodiversity. His unique background combines traditional marine 
              evolutionary ecology with modern molecular biology. He will use  both in his
              research on sibling species (two or more species that  cannot be or have not
              been morphologically separated), and marine  invertebrate neoextinction and the
              effects of biological invasion  on diversity. His training puts him at the
              forefront of this  emerging cross-disciplinary field, and the problems he is 
              addressing are important socially and scientifically. He started  teaching in
              graduate school, and has continued successfully ever  since.  His plans during
              the NYI include undergraduate teaching,  graduate teaching and directed
              research, in which he will stress  exposure to research methods and current
              literature.
