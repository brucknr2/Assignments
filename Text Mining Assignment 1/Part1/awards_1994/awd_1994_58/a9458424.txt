Abstract    :
                   Dr. Spence is an NSF Young Investigator whose research  interests lie in
              theoretical and experimental aspects of  magnetospheric physics.  He will
              participate in the energetic  particle experiment aboard the Central European
              Satellite for  Advanced Research.  Further, he plans to investigate emerging 
              solid-state device processing and technologies and develop a novel  medium and
              energetic particle detection system suitable for future  spaceflight
              applications.  As an NYI, he will also devote  considerable effort to teaching.
