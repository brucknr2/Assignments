Abstract    :
              9458053  Mueller  Solid-state materials including zeolites, aluminophosphates, 
              minerals, ceramic precursors, and inorganic oxide glasses will be  studied with
              techniques of high-resolution NMR spectroscopy.   Magic-angle spinning and more
              complicated quadrupolar averaging  techniques will be coupled with homonuclear
              and heteronuclear  correlation spectroscopy to determine microstructural 
              connectivities, bond distances, and local topology.  %%%  ***
