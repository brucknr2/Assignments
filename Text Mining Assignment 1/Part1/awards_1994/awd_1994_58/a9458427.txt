Abstract    :
                   Dr. Polvani is an NSF Young Investigator whose research will  span a wide
              range of topics.  He will investigate the dynamics of  the Earth's atmosphere
              and ocean, as well as other planetary  atmospheres, emphasizing nonlinear wave
              and vortex phenomena.  He  will also carry out an ambitious teaching program
              focused on  applied mathematics, fluid dynamics, and atmospheric and ocean 
              sciences.
