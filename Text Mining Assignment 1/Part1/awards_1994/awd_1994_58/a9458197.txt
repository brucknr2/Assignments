Abstract    :
              Abstract  9458197  Bacterial cytokinesis will be analyzed with genetic,
              biochemical  and molecular approaches. It has been shown that the control of
              the  placement of the division septum in Escherichia coli is regulated  by a 3
              gene operon and one of the genes products provides  topological specificity. It
              has also been shown that an essential  septation protein, FtsZ is important to
              cytokinesis. It forms a  membrane-associated ring structure at the site of
              septum formation.  This ring shrinks as it remains associated with the leading
              edge of  the ingrowing septum until cytokinesis is complete. In vitro, the 
              protein self-associates into filamentous structures upon binding of  GTP. We
              will develop a quantitative assay for FtsZ polymerization  and study the role
              of nucleotide hydrolysis in Fts-multimerization.  Genetic studies have
              suggested that FtsZ interacts with a number of  other division related
              proteins. Several of these will be tested in  purified systems by a variety of
              methods. In addition, peptide-  tagged derivatives of FtsZ will be used in an
              unbiased search for  proteins that interact directly with FtsZ.  %%%   Although
              much is known about the genetics and physiology of the  bacterium, Escherichia
              coli, much less is known about mechanisms  involved with converting one cell
              into two cells. This work should  deepen our understanding of the genetic
              regulation of and the  physiological mechanisms involved in cell division.  ***
