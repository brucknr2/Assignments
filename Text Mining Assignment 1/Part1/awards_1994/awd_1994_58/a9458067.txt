Abstract    :
              9458067  Stevens    Two areas of research are being pursued that focus on the 
              receptor molecules that are responsible for neuronal signal  transduction.  The
              first project takes a structural approach  using x-ray and electron
              crystallography to elucidate the  structure and function of the family of
              7-transmembrane G-  protein coupled receptors.  Although there has been a great
               deal of information obtained about 7-transmembrane cell  receptors, the
              information has not been expanded and  consolidated so that an understanding of
              their structure and  function is known.  These molecules are key to
              understanding  how signal transduction occurs between the cells in the  brain
              and nervous system.  The second project uses the  neuronal receptors described
              in the first part in the design  of a new molecular biosensor.  The receptor
              biosensor  harnesses the power of these selective and sensitive  receptors by
              mimicking how cells communicate the detection  of drugs, odorants, etc.  The
              biosensor is a new material  that couples the receptor biosensor to colored
              lipids that  change color upon ligand binding induced structural changes  in
              the receptor.  By designing materials that mimic how  neurons communicate, we
              are able to learn more about how  communication occurs.
