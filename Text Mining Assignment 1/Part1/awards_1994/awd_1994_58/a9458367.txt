Abstract    :
              9458367  Zachos    Funds are provided for a NYI award to James Zachos of the 
              University of California at Santa Cruz.  Over the next five years  his research
              will center on defining and comparing changes in the  planetary temperature
              gradient(with emphasis on tropical  temperatures) during two suspected episodes
              of greenhouse warming,  the early Pliocene (~4 Ma) and early Eocene (~55 Ma). 
              These  observations will be used to evaluated competing models of past  global
              warming. Dr. Zachos has developed and taught courses at the  graduate and
              undergraduate levels. His teaching priorities during  the course of this award
              are to: restructure the Earth Sciences  curriculum, and improve undergraduate
              interest and enrollment in  Earth Sciences.
