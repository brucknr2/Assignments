Abstract    :
              9458373  Pyrak-Nolte       This research project will attempt to quantitatively
              establish  the links among the mechanical, hydraulic, and seismic properties 
              of rock discontinuities.  All rocks contain mechanical  discontinuities on many
              length scales.  These discontinuities, such  as cracks, fractures, or joints,
              are sources of anisotropy and  inhomogeneity.  They influence and control the
              many forms of rock  behavior.  Bridging between newly developed departments of
              Civil  Engineering and Geological Sciences at Notre Dame will be provided  by
              this P.I.  A new line of undergraduate courses, previously  nonexistent here,
              will be developed to integrate the concepts of  geoscience with civil
              engineering.
