Abstract    :
              9458349  Hara    This NYI award to Tetsu Hara is to support his research on
              small  scale ocean dynamics.  He will use field and laboratory data of 
              capillary-gravity wave spectra acquired by a state-of-the-art  scanning laser
              slope gage to develop new theories and numerical  models to explain the
              detailed physical mechanism by which surface  waves impact the wind stress and
              the air-sea gas flux. His teaching  plan includes the development of an new
              graduate course on "Physics  of the Air-Sea Interface, which will provide the
              foundation and  technique to understand the basic fluid dynamics which control
              the  air-sea mass/heat/momentum flux and organize seminars on air-sea  flux. He
              also acts as a faculty mentor during a summer  undergraduate research program.
