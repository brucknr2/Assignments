Abstract    :
              9401989  Jenkins  In this project, the PI will obtain, analyze, and interpret
              Tritium  /Helium-3 samples on seven sections of the Hydrographic Program in 
              the Indian Ocean for the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE).   The PIs
              will acquire, process, and analyze 2176 Tritium samples and  2256 He-3 samples.
               In addition the PIs will provide logistical  support for the shipboard
              processing Tr/He-3 samples to be obtained  by other groups on the Indian Ocean
              WHP, as well.  Use of this  tracer will focus on upper ocean subduction,
              ventilation, and  circulation; identication of water mass characteristics,
              exchange  among various water mass regimes, characteristics, exchange among 
              various water mass regimes, pathways and flux of the Indonesian  Throughflow,
              and rates of oxygen utilization and primary  production.
