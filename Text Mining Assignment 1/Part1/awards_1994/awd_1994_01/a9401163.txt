Abstract    :
              9401163   Reshetikhin                  This project is concerned with the study
              of quantized  universal enveloping algebras and their representations together 
              with their applications to low-dimensional topology and to  1+1-dimension
              models of quantum field theory.  The principal  investigator will investigate
              the relations between the structure  of the category of modules over quantized
              universal enveloping  algebras and corresponding affine Lie algebras.  He will
              further  study invariants of 3-manifolds to better understand the relation 
              between the combinatorial approach to topological field theory  and the
              differential-geometric one.  He will continue studying  the quantized universal
              enveloping algebras of  infinite-dimensional Lie algebras and their
              representation theory  and, in particular, when the parameter of deformations
              is a root  of 1.                  Quantum groups are a new area of research for
              both  mathematicians and physicists.  On the mathematical side, it  combines
              three of the oldest areas of "pure" mathematics,  algebra, analysis and
              geometry, yet it is of great interest to  physicists working on conformal
              quantum field theory.
