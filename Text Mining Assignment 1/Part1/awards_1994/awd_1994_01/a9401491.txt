Abstract    :
              9401491  Simon       Professor Simon will continue his research looking into the
                spectral theory of Schrodinger operators and research  concerning  inverse
              spectral and inverse scattering problems.   Both sets of  research exploit
              detailed studies of the Krein  spectral shift.  Among areas that will be
              explored are: extending the rank one  theory to include trace class
              perturbations, and the inverse  problem for unbounded potentials, which should
              be determined in  some way by the eigenvalues and Dirichlet eigenvalues.  In 
              particular, an attempt will be made to describe the isospectral  manifold for
              this problem.       Professor Simon will study a number of problems in the 
              mathematical theory connected with quantum mechanics.  One aspect  of his work
              involves the study of long-time behavior in the model  of electrons in solid
              and random media, whose properties are at  the forefront of innovative
              materials design.  Simon also expects  to study problems in inverse spectral
              and scattering theory: the  general issue of determining a microscopic
              structure from data  that can be readily observed.  Inverse theory is central
              to areas  as varied as radar detection of submarines and the interpretation  of
              medical tomography.  ***
