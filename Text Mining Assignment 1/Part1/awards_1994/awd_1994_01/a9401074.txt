Abstract    :
              9401074  Adams       Adams will continue his work on the representation theory
              of  real reductive Lie groups, with particular focus on the  representation
              correspondence arising from real reductive dual  pairs, generalizing recent
              work on complex groups and the dual  pairs (O(p,q),Sp(2n,R) with p+q=2n+1.  He
              will also investigate  questions arising in connection with Arthur's
              conjectures.       The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian 
              mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in  twentieth
              century mathematics.  As the mathematical vehicle for  exploiting the
              symmetries inherent in a system, the  representation theory of Lie groups has
              had a profound impact up  on mathematics itself, particularly in analysis and
              number  theory, and upon the oretical physics, especially quantum  mechanics
              and elementary particle physics.  ***
