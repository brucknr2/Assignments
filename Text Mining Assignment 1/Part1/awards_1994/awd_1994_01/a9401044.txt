Abstract    :
              9401044  Morral    The goal of this program is to model complex diffusional
              processes  with simple equations that are based on rigorous, fundamental 
              principles.  Equations have already been derived for single and  selected
              multiphase systems in terms of the "square root  diffusivity," a kinetic
              property of materials.  The equations have  value to students who are learning
              how complex alloys differ from  binary alloys and to engineers working on alloy
              and process design.   The equations show how to measure the square root
              diffusivity of  complex alloys, how to minimize interdiffusion rates and
              Kirkendall  porosity, and how to vary the phases that form in interdiffusion 
              zones.  An experimental program combining electron microprobe and  image
              analysis of nickel-base superalloys is being used to test the  accuracy of the
              equations and to uncover new principles related to  diffusion in
              multicomponent, multiphase systems.  %%%  Diffusion causes property degradation
              in coated turbine blades,  metal-matrix composites, and other materials used
              for high  temperature service.  In addition, diffusion is important during 
              high temperature processing, for example, pack cementation,  carburizing and
              annealing.  ***
