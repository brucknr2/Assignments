Abstract    :
              9401208  Guo       This RUI award supports mathematical research on problems in 
              harmonic analysis related to spectral synthesis, which roughly  states that
              smooth, decaying functions vanishing off a set  approximate Fourier transforms
              vanishing on the same set.  This  project is mainly concerned with spectral
              synthesis on manifolds,  the restriction of the Fourier transform and partial
              differential  equations with constant coefficients.  Specifically, the project 
              concerns distributions supported by hypersurfaces in Euclidean  space and how
              the curvature of the manifold is related to decay  properties of the Fourier
              transform of the distribution.  The  work  draws on recent results giving
              asymptotic estimates for weak  spectral synthesis.  Since there are examples
              where weak spectral  synthesis fails for general manifolds, it is necessary to 
              investigate the proper conditions, such as constant nullity,  which  will
              provide positive answers.        Harmonic analysis concerns the decomposition
              and  reconstruction of functions through representations in terms of  simpler
              components.  One of the fundamental tools of harmonic  analysis is the Fourier
              transform which plays equally central  role  in the study of partial
              differential equations where the two  fields  come together naturally. 
              Analysis of the transform, restricted  to  manifolds, is a relatively open
              field in which general results  are  usually hard to achieve.
