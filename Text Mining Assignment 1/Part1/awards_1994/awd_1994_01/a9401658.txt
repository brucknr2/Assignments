Abstract    :
              9401658  Cole       This project supports a group of American researchers in 
              carrying out a survey on the state-of-the-art in speech and natural  language
              processing in the European Community (EC) and in the  United States (US).  The
              principal investigators, in cooperation  with a similar team of researchers
              from the European Community,  define and organize the effort.  The objectives
              of the project  include but are not limited to assessing research that consider
               empirical verification of the effectiveness of computerized speech  and
              language processing, that promotes further development of  natural language
              understanding, processing, modeling, and of speech  analysis, synthesis, and
              recognition, and that point to the most  salient research opportunities under
              the present circumstances in  the US and Europe.  The project also supports the
              collection of  information and the writing of a report and its dissemination.
