Abstract    :
              9401540  Smith       During the past few years the theory of operator algebras, 
              both selfadjoint and non-selfadjoint has evolved at a rapid pace.  Recent
              developments by many researchers are providing further  ties between the
              selfadjoint and non-selfadjoint aspects of the  theory. The proposed work
              focuses on the theory of tensor  products of operator algebras, complete
              boundedness for operator  algebras, cohomology theory, and its connection with
              algebraic  topology. Schur multiplier theory, the structure of derivations  and
              automorphisms of non-selfadjoint and selfadjoint algebras and  compact ideal
              perturbations in semifinite algebras will also be  studied.       Operator
              theory is concerned with infinite generalizations  of finite matrices. When
              operator multiplication and addition are  defined on a collection of operators
              the resulting collection is  called an operator algebra. Cohomology is a theory
              that examines  when local pieces can be put together to form a global object. 
              This project is concerned with cohomology on operator algebras.  The goal is to
              contribute to an old conjecture which asserts that  certain cohomologies of
              operator algebras are trivial. This would  mean that local objects can always
              be pieced together into a  global object.  ***
