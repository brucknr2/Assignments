Abstract    :
              9401592  McClanahan       The investigator has previously shown that Pimsner's
              most  general exact sequence of K-groups is valid in the case of  twisted
              crossed products relative to a circle 2-valued cocycle.  One component of the
              proposed project involves extending this  result to the case of unitary
              multiplier-valued cocycles. A  possible application of this result would be the
              computation of  the K-groups of certain group C*-algebras in terms of the K- 
              groups of the group C*-algebras of a normal subgroup and of an  action of the
              corresponding quotient group. The investigator  plans to investigate extending
              Pimsner's exact sequence for  groups acting on trees to the partial crossed
              product setting.  This will enable the computation of the K-groups of many 
              other amalgamated products of C*-algebras.       This project involves
              computation of invariants of  operator algebras. An operator is an infinite
              dimensional  generalization of matrices. Given the natural algebraic structure 
              a collection of operators can frequently be considered as an  algebra. A
              C*-algebra is an algebra of operators with additional  topological structure
              that is closed under the adjoint operation.  A basic problem is to classify
              operator algebras up to  isomorphism. This is frequently handled by determining
              simple  invariants associated with operator algebras. One such invariant  is
              the K-group of a C*-algebra. This project will provide  explicit computations
              of K-groups of product C*-algebras.  ***
