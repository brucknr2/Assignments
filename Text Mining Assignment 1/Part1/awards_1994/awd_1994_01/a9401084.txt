Abstract    :
              9401084  Scott          This  is  an award under the Grants for Improving 
              Doctoral  Dissertation Research program.  It is a study of the influence of 
              the  conflict  between occupational and organizational  roles  in  producing  a
              likelihood to leave an organization.  A  variety  of  hypotheses  about 
              variations in the extent of  role  strain  and  inclination to leave the
              organization will be tested by means  of  self-administered, mail-in
              questionnaires to  be  filled  out  by  occupants  of  five  professional roles
               in  two  large  military  organizations.       The reasons people voluntarily
              leave organizations is one of  the  enduring  puzzles of the study of complex
              organizations  and  employment.   Previous  efforts to  draw  predictions  from
               role  theory  to  predict organizational departure have not  been  very 
              successful.  This study will utilize a new conception based  upon  the 
              conflict between occupational and organizational roles.   If  the  predictions 
              made  by the researcher  are  borne  out,  this  research  should  provide 
              ideas about  how  to  reduce  a  major  disruption and expense faced by
              organizations--employee turnover.  In  addition  to  the  scientific gains to 
              be  achieved  by  the  research,  this  award will materially assist a highly 
              promising  student in completing research for the Ph. D. dissertation.  Thus 
              it  contributes to the future scientific manpower of  the  nation  and  the 
              thorough  training  of the next  generation  of  social  scientists.  ***
