Abstract    :
              9401667  Paul    The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary physics research 
              project between Dr. Peter Paul of the State University of New  York and Dr.
              Istvan Dioszegi of the Hungarian Academy of  Sciences' Institute of Isotopes is
              to examine heavy nuclei where  the collectivity of giant resonances is well
              developed.   Specifically, the researchers will explore the evolution of 
              nuclear shape and measure the viscosity of nuclear matter as a  function of
              temperature in heavy ion fusion-fission reactions.   The researchers intend to
              determine these parameters from giant  dipole resonance.  The associated
              reaction mechanism will also be  studied.  Results are expected to contribute
              to our basic  knowledge of superheavy elements.    This project in nuclear
              physics fulfills the program objective of  advancing scientific knowledge by
              enabling experts in the United  States and Eastern Europe to combine
              complementary talents and  share research resources in areas of strong mutual
              interest and  competence.    ***
