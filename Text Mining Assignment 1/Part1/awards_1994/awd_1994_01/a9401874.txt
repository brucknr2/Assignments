Abstract    :
              9401874  K. Becker    Experimental investigations of collision cross sections of
               interest to low-temperature plasma processing are  investigated.  The emphasis
              is on reactive species  containing F, Cl and Br atoms with the goal of
              producing  data on  excitation and dissociation by analysis of the  optical
              spectra produced by electron impact on the parent  molecules.  The data is
              essential for characterizing and  modeling reactive plasmas used in
              industrially important  processes such as plasma etching.
