Abstract    :
              9401884  Trost  This award from the Office of Secial Projects of the Division 
              of Chemistry and the Eastern Europe Program of the  International Division will
              enable the participation of  thirteen American chemists and thirteen chemists
              from the  Former Soviet Union (FSU) in a Bilateral National Science 
              Foundation/FSU Workshop on Organic Synthesis being held at  Stanford University
              in Palo Alto, California, on  March 9-12,  1994.  The workshop will also be
              attended by six leading  research leaders from industry.  The goal of the
              Workshop is to  stimulate future contacts between American and Russian chemists
               and to help define the academic/industrial interface in  chemistry.  FSU
              participants will attend the National Meeting  of the American Chemical Society
              following the Workshop to  further their contacts with U.S. chemists and to
              gain a more  intimate understanding of the chemical sciences in the United 
              States.  ***
