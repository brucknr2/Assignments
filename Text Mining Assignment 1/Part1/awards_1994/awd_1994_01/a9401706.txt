Abstract    :
              9401706  Schonberg       Statistics on the numbers of female and minority PhD's
              in computer science and engineering remain very disappointing.  In an effort to
              improve these numbers, this project shall provide travel funds to faculty and
              students from women's colleges and minority institutions so that they can
              attend the ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Languages and several related
              tutorial sessions.  Primarily undergraduate institutions shall be primarily
              targeted.  ***
