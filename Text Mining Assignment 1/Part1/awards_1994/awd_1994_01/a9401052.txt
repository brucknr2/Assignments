Abstract    :
              9401052  Schadler       The overall goal of this project is to explore the
              potential   for thermal spray processing to produce unique, polymer  
              nanocomposites that could open up new applications.  Specifically,   the
              objectives of this project are to develop the combustion flame   spray and high
              velocity oxy-fuel processes for spraying ceramic   nanoparticle/polymer
              coatings, to explore a variety of polymer   matrices and ceramic particulate
              reinforcements in order to assess   a wide variety of potential applications,
              and to characterize the   coating for the appropriate applications.  The
              scientific   objectives of this project are to understand the
              process-structure-  property relationships for ceramic/polymer composites
              formed using  thermal spray techniques, to explore the micromechanics of 
              deformation in these nanocomposites in order to understand the  mechanisms that
              lead to improved mechanical properties, and to  understand the effect of
              ceramic surface preparation on the  mechanical properties of the composites.   
                 Successful completion of this project could lead to a better   understanding
              of ceramic/polymer nanocomposites, which have   promising material properties
              including substantial increase in   toughness, reduced permeability of water,
              and reduced coefficient   of thermal expansion.  Abrasion resistance, tensile
              strength, and   Young's modulus all seem to improve with the addition of
              nanosize   ceramic particles in the polymer.
