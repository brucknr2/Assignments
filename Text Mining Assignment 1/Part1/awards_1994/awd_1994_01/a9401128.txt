Abstract    :
              The PIs will carry out the 3D simulation of current-carrying flux  tube
              dynamics.  In particular, the PI will study:  (1) the  interaction of submerged
              flux tubes that carry a substantial amount  of current, and thus, helicity, and
              (2) the global dynamics of  solar flux tubes that lead to the morphology and
              evolution of the  overall active region dynamics.  The combination of these two
               processes will lead to the oft-observed global features'  characteristics. 
              The PI corroborates his computational/theoretical  results closely with the
              solar satellite and ground-based  observational results, particularly from
              Yohkoh.***
