Abstract    :
              9401405  Keller       Research will be conducted on a number of different
              problems  in applied mathematics.  The following problems will be studied:  
              (1) the extension of a result deriving an exact nonreflecting  boundary
              condition to electromagnetic waves governed by Maxwell's  equations and to
              elastic waves governed by the linear theory of  elasticity; (2) the development
              of a finite element formulation  of scattering problems for the scalar wave
              equation incorporating  the nonreflecting boundary condition; (3) the use of
              asymptotic  methods to analyze the error at the nth step of an iterative 
              numerical method; (4) the folding of elastic sheets and the  coiling of ropes
              when they fall onto a horizontal surface, and  (5) the study of resonantly
              interacting waves.       Perturbation, asymptotic, and numerical methods will
              be  developed and utilized to study a number of problems in applied 
              mathematics.  These problems will include the coiling of a rope  falling on a
              horizontal plane, the folding of a sheet falling on  a horizontal plane, the
              development of numerical methods  employing exact nonreflecting boundary
              conditions which are  nonlocal, the use of asymptotic methods to analyze the
              error in  various iterative computational schemes, and the resonant 
              interaction of nonlinear waves, such as gravity waves on the  surface of a
              fluid.
