Abstract    :
              9401561  Andrei    Technical  abstract:   Electrons on a  helium  substrate 
              form  a  two  dimensional  electron system.  This system will be investigated 
              in  a  region  of  the  phase  diagram where correlations  between  electrons 
              determine  the  in-plane and out-of-plane dynamics.   The  experiments  focus
              on (a) the phase boundary of the electron crystal and how it  is  affected by
              screening; (b) the interplay between the electron  crystal  and  Landau 
              quantization in the presence of a perpendicular  magnetic  field;  (c) the
              effects of crystal correlations on tunneling; (d)  the  effect of the Landau
              quantization on magneto-tunneling rates.    Non-technical abstract: Electrons
              captured on a thin layer  of  helium  at very low temperatures form a two
              dimensional system which can serve  as  a  prototype  system  for the study of 
              electron  states  in  more  conventional  states of condensed matter.  The key
              task  required  for  realizing  a  case in which very many electrons are
              clustered  on  the  helium film is to reduce significantly the impurities and
              roughness of  the  underlying  solid on which the helium film  is  deposited.  
              This  project  will  focus on utilizing ultra clean and ultra  smooth  solid 
              substrates in order to achieve such a high density of electrons  which  has 
              not  been previously  achieved.  This high electron density  will  allow search
              of as yet undiscovered effects which will be important to  the  electron on
              helium problem in particular, but also to  other  two  dimensional electron
              systems in general.  ***
