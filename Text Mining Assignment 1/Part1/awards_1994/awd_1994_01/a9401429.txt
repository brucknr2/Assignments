Abstract    :
              940142  Dunkl       This award supports mathematical research on problems 
              arising in the theory of special functions emphasizing underlying  group
              structures and extensions to several variables.  The  analysis involves the
              study of root systems using a technique a  parametrized algebra of
              differential-difference operators  associated to finite reflection groups. 
              There is an intertwining  operator which relates these algebras for different
              parameter  values.  An important part of the project will consist of finding 
              integral formulas for this operator for Weyl groups by means of  techniques
              based on the associated compact Lie groups.   Progress in this topic would lead
              to more detailed information,  such as asymptotics, about the Bessel functions
              of Coxeter groups  and certain generalizations of the Fourier transform.  Work
              will  also continue on singular polynomials of Coxeter groups, at  topic which
              connects representation theory, monodromy of  differential equations with
              rational singularities on the  reflecting hyperplanes of the groups, Hecke
              algebras and the  intertwining operator.       Approximation theory and special
              functions has  fruitful connections with many branches of applied mathematics 
              such as differential equations, operator theory, numerical  integration,
              continued fractions and control theory to name a  few.  These subjects have
              close connections with special  functions and related symmetry groups which
              provide a natural  synergism between the theoretical and applied aspects of
              this  research.  ***
