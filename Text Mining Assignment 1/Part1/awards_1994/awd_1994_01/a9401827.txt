Abstract    :
              9401827  Swift  In this project, the PI will provide hydrographic support for
              WOCE  (World Ocean Circulation Experiment) Hydrographic Program (WHP)  sections
              I9N (95deg East), I7N (Arabian Sea), and I3 (transIndian  Ocean at 20deg S), as
              part of the US WOCE Indian Ocean Expedition  (IOE).  The PI will also provide
              logistics support (shipping and  travel) for other investigators as needed. 
              This work is the  primary data collection activity for the US WOCE IOE.
