Abstract    :
              9401176  Speh/Barbasch       Speh will continue her joint work with Rohlfs on
              cuspidal  cohomology.  She also will investigate the analytic torsion of 
              locally symmetric spaces.  In joint work the PI's will study the  residual
              spectrum of the split orthogonal and symplectic group.  Barbasch will continue
              his research on unipotent representations  for real groups, in particular their
              character theory and  unitarity.  He also will study spherical unitary dual for
              split p-  adic groups.       The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the
              Norwegian  mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in 
              twentieth century mathematics.  As the mathematical vehicle for  exploiting the
              symmetries inherent in a system, the  representation theory of Lie groups has
              had a profound impact  upon mathematics itself, particularly in analysis and
              number  theory, and upon theoretical physics, especially quantum  mechanics and
              elementary particle physics.  ***
