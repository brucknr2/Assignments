Abstract    :
              Rodl       This award funds the research of Professor Vojtech Rodl in extremal
              graph  theory and Ramsey Theory.  Prof. Rodl will apply probabilistic methods
              to problems in  random graphs and set systems.  These include questions on
              matching in graphs and  hypergraphs.        The research is in the general area
              of combinatorics. Combinatorics attempts to  find efficient methods to study
              how discrete collections can be organized. It turns out  that some kinds of
              structure are unavoidable, and Ramsey Theory studies these basic  properties of
              all collections. The behavior of discrete collections is extremely important 
              in modeling communication systems and plays a role in modern computing, 
              communications and operations. ***
