Abstract    :
              Dr. Wilson will continue his program of computational  physics.  Research will
              concentrate on topics in  astrophysics and nuclear theory.  This will include
              work on  neutron star collisions, supernovae models, and relativistic  heavy
              ion collisions.  This research will study systems thought to be important for 
              new experimental facilities currently under construction.  These systems are
              highly complex; and computer simulations  are the best tool to study their
              details to plan future  experiments.
