Abstract    :
              9401151  Davis        This award provides support for the acquisition of a
              distributed memory  parallel computer together with support hardware for
              scientific visualization and  storage of large image databases.  The proposed
              system will be an experimental  facility designed as a testbed for operating
              system and algorithm development,  and will consequently run a wide range of
              experimental operating systems.                The research topics to be
              explored span a broad range of applied research  in high performance computing
              in three general categories:  programming tools for  HPC systems, parallel
              algorithms for scientific computing, and symbolic coding.   A key component of
              the research program is the development of scalable parallel  data structure
              and algorithms for the representation and analysis of global data  sets arising
              from environmental science problems.
