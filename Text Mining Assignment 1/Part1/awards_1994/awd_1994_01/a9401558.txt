Abstract    :
              9401558  Shatah       This award supports mathematical research on partial 
              differential equations which arise in studies of classical  fields.  The work
              involves studies of hyperbolic Yang-Mils  equations and wave maps.  It is
              planned to address fundamental  questions on existence, uniqueness and
              formation of singularities  for these models.  Also considered will be models
              defined on the  n-sphere where efforts will be made to show that, at least in
              the  one-dimensional case, unstable stationary solutions possess  homoclinic
              orbits.  Analysis of the asymptotic behavior of  solutions to perturbed wave
              equations and nonlinear lattices will  also be carried out.  Decay estimates
              for solutions of the wave  equation on the Schwarzschild metric where there is
              a trapped  sphere and decay rates for the discrete wave equation will be 
              developed.  This results will be used to study the dynamics of  nonlinear
              multi-dimensional lattices, specifically the phenomenon  of resonance.      
              Partial differential equations form a basis for  mathematical modeling of the
              physical world.  The role of  mathematical analysis is not so much to create
              the equations as  it is to provide qualitative and quantitative information
              about  the solutions.  This may include answers to questions about  uniqueness,
              smoothness and growth.  In addition, analysis often  develops methods for
              approximation of solutions and estimates on  the accuracy of these
              approximations.  ***
