Abstract    :
              9401739  Crabtree  This project, supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and 
              Organometallic Chemistry Program, is concerned with the further  development of
              the chemistry of X-H sigma-bonds (X=H, N, Si and  its congeners, and M)
              coordinated to transition metals.  This  is a recently recognized area of
              organometallic chemistry for  which the underlying principles are unclear;  the
              goal of this  reseach is to discover general trends across several classes of 
              sigma-bond complexes.  Among the several goals to be pursued  are:  generation
              of "stretched" dihydrogen complexes and new  polyhydrogen species by steric
              crowding, demonstration of a  change in reactivity for unsymmetrically bridged
              metal  hydrides, and demonstration of a distinctive reactivity for  sigma-bond
              bound N-H complexes.  Techniques for detection and  characterization of such
              compounds based upon NMR spectroscopy  will be sought.  %%%  One of the most
              exciting recent developments in transition  metal chemistry was the discovery
              that molecular hydrogen can  bind to a metal complex without cleavage of the 
              hydrogen-hydrogen bond.  Professor Crabtree has played an  important role in
              the elucidation of the factors that determine  how molecular hydrogen will bind
              to a metal and in the  development of spectroscopic techniques for determining
              the  mode of binding.  This project attempts to determine the role  that such
              sigma-bond complexes play in transition metal  chemistry of other X-H bonds. 
              Ultimately the information  obtained from this work will be important in the
              development of  a better understanding of organometallic reaction mechanisms 
              and may be useful in the design of more specific catalysts for  industrially
              important reactions.  ***
