Abstract    :
              9401456  Baker       The project involves the classification of triangular UHF 
              algebras. The goal is to establish a Banach algebra  classification theory for
              these algebras. It is further proposed  to develop a classification scheme for
              triangular UHF K algebras.       Investigations will also be made of triangular
              UHF algebras  over the p-adics. Other investigations will be made in the areas 
              of canonical subalgebras of AF C*-algebras, the representation  theory of
              standard triangular UHF operator algebras, and the  calculation of the first K
              group of certain subdiagonal  subalgebras of type II von Neumann algebras.     
               The general area of this project is operator algebras.  Operators can be
              thought of as finite or infinite matrices of  complex numbers. Special types of
              operators are often put  together in an algebra, naturally called an operator
              algebra.  Among other problems, Professor Baker will try to classify  operator
              algebras that can be approximated by operator algebras  consisting of finite
              matrices.   ***
