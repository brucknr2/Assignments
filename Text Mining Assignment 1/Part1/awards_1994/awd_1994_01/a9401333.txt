Abstract    :
              Ni  9401333          Work supported by this award focuses on the mathematical 
              analysis of nonlinear partial differential equations, systems and  their
              applications.  The research continues several projects such  as the study of
              spike-layers in mathematical biology.  These  arise in mathematical
              descriptions of the chemotactic aggregation  stage of cellular slime molds. 
              One is interested in solutions of  the relevant equations which exhibit spiky
              patterns dependent on  the equation coefficients.  Such patterns have been
              observed  experimentally.  A second line of investigation concerns cross- 
              diffusion in population dynamics.  The primary question to be  studied here is
              one of determining and understanding the steady  states of such systems.  Work
              will also be done measuring the  stability of steady states of a class of
              semilinear heat  equations in n-dimensional space and on the inhomogeneous 
              semilinear elliptic or parabolic equations arising in infinite  particle
              systems in probability.           Partial differential equations form a basis
              for  mathematical modeling of the physical world.  The role of  mathematical
              analysis is not so much to create the equations as  it is to provide
              qualitative and quantitative information about  the solutions.  This may
              include answers to questions about  uniqueness, smoothness and growth.  In
              addition, analysis often  develops methods for approximation of solutions and
              estimates on  the accuracy of these approximations.
