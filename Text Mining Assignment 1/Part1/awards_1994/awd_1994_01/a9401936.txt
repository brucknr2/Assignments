Abstract    :
              9401936  DITTEL    A fundamental, yet unresolved, question in Biological
              Oceanography  concerns the feeding habits and trophic dynamics of zooplankton.
              In  addition, the importance of understanding the ecological role of 
              meroplankton in marine ecosystems has generated considerable  interest in
              larval nutrition. Most studies concerning feeding  behavior of larval forms
              have dealt with crustaceans, particularly  decapod larvae. It is well known
              that larvae require animal food to  complete development, but there is some
              indication that  phytoplankton is also utilized. However, most studies have
              been  based on laboratory experiments using prey such as Artemia salina 
              nauplii and rotifers. The most common method used to assess the  natural diet
              of marine organisms has been gut content analyses.  However, this method has
              several drawbacks. For example, gut  content analysis is of limited use,
              particularly in crustaceans,  due to the difficulty of identifying crushed prey
              items. This  project will use a new method, the polymerase chain reaction
              (PCR),  to study the feeding habits of crab larvae under natural  conditions.
              This project will examine whether PCR can be used  successfully to assess the
              diet of crab larvae. If successful  further research concerning food
              preferences using potential prey  items from the natural environment will also
              be examined.  ***
