Abstract    :
                  9401924  Fletcher    This Americas Program award will support Dr. Neil
              Fletcher, of  Florida State University, Tallahassee, in a research 
              collaboration in nuclear physics with Dr. Jacinto Liendo,  Instituto Venezolano
              de Investigaciones Cientificas, Caracas.    The main objective of the project
              will be to measure the alpha-  particle widths of several states near breakup
              threshold in 13C,  with the goal of further understanding the cluster structure
               properties of the states and improving the obtainable energy  resolution.  In
              this, they will have access to a new high-  resolution nuclear spectroscopic
              tool developed by the two  researchers.    The original detection method for
              low energy nuclear physics,  resonant particle decay spectroscopy, has not been
              utilized for  ultra-high energy resolution in nuclear reactions.  One of the 
              primary aspects of this research will be to apply this method,  and the
              researchers' newly discovered angular correlation  property, to problems in the
              structure of states in p-shell  nuclei.  The results will be of high interest,
              both for the  specific information obtained and as a demonstration of a 
              potential new tool in nuclear astrophysics.   ***
