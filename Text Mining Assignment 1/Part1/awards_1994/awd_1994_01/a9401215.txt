Abstract    :
              9401215   Malikov                  This award supports research on the
              representation theory of  affine Lie algebras and quantum groups.  The
              principal  investigator will work on (1) affine Lie algebra modules realized 
              in multi-valued functions on a flag manifold; (2)  Wess-Zumino-Witten model at
              a critical level; (3) complex powers  in algebra and geometry; and (4) the
              Gel'fand-Kirillov conjecture  for quantum groups. Many different algebraic
              objects can be  represented as algebraic sets of transformations of other 
              algebraic objects.  Through these representations their structure  can be
              determined.  This project is concerned with the  representation theory of
              infinite dimensional Lie algebras.  The  study of these algebras has
              applications throughout mathematics  and mathematical physics.   ***
