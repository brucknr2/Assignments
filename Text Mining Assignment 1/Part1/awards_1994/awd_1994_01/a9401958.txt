Abstract    :
              9401958  MILLER      This award is under the International Junior Investigator 
              and Postdoctoral Fellows Program, which enables U.S.  scientists and engineers
              to conduct three to twelve months  of research abroad at research centers of
              proven excellence.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint 
              research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities,  expertise and
              experimental conditions abroad.    This award will support a six-month
              postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Christopher M. Miller of Lehigh University
              to  work with Professor Robert G. Gilbert at the University of  Sydney.   
              Their project will apply complementary knowledge and  experimental techniques
              of the Sydney University and Lehigh  University groups to understand the
              fundamental science of  processes governing polymer formation, and properties
              of the  resulting polymer in miniemulsion systems.    The project will build
              into already existing models for  miniemulsion kinetics the new discoveries
              that have been  reported by the Sydney group. An outcome of these will be 
              computer codes whose predictions should be consistent with  the extensive data
              for archetypical miniemulsion  polymerizations compiled by Miller during his
              doctoral  research.  The project will make use of the Y radiolysis  relaxation
              facilities available to the Sydney group to carry  out several experiments. 
              The increased understanding  derived from these experiments should pave the way
              for  innovative design of these processes in the future.  ***
