Abstract    :
              9401575  Stembridge        This award funds the research of Professor John
              Stembridge  into applications of combinatorial methods into problems of 
              Algebra.  The goal is to produce algorithmic methods for  producing certain
              generating functions,  enumerating reduced  expressions obtained from studies
              of algebra,  and constructing  particular bases.  The results should have
              applications in  algebra, number theory and algebraic geometry.        This
              research falls in the broad category of combinatorics,   which is one of the
              most active fields in today's mathematics. At  its roots, combinatorics is the
              study of systematic counting.    Counting can be incredibly difficult when the
              objects are   difficult to list,  and combinatorists look for general methods  
              for overcoming these difficulties.  Today's combinatorics makes   use of a wide
              variety of the most advanced and modern   mathematical techniques.  Although
              its roots go back several   centuries, the field has had an explosive
              development in the past  few decades.  This growth comes from its importance in
                communications and information technology and from the success of  modern
              techniques to problems of counting.
