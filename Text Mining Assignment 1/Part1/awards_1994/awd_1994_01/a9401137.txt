Abstract    :
              9401137     Matumoto       Matumoto will investigate analysis concerning the 
              representation theory of real reductive Lie groups.  Of  particular interest
              will be use of representation theory in the  study of automorphic forms.  He
              will also investigate induced  representations from drived functor modules and
              restrictions of  representations.  These problems arise naturally in the study
              of  the unitary dual of reductive groups, one of the main subjects of  the
              area.         The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian 
              mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in  twentieth
              century mathematics.  As the mathematical vehicle for  exploiting the
              symmetries inherent in a system, the  representation theory of Lie groups has
              had a profound impact up  on mathematics itself, particularly in analysis and
              number  theory, and upon the oretical physics, especially quantum  mechanics
              and elementary particle physics.  ***
