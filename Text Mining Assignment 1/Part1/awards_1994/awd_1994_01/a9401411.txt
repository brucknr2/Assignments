Abstract    :
              9401411       Yang            This project consists of two related parts.  The
              first is a  joint project with Richard Hain (also at Duke), in which they 
              intend to study a new type of function, the "braid  polylogarithms," which they
              hope will become a bridge between the  important and much studied classical
              polylogarithms and the  Grassman polylogarithms.  The second topic is part of
              an ongoing  program to study the close relationship between hyperbolic 
              3-manifolds and the third algebraic K-groups.       Recently, there has been a
              renaissance of research on  polylogarithms because of their interesting
              applications to many  mathematical disciplines, including algebraic K-theory,
              number  theory, hyperbolic geometry and conformal field theory.   Applications
              are also found in theoretical physics.  This  research hopes to provide further
              understanding of the  relationship between the two important types of
              polylogarithm  functions: the classical polylogarithms and the Grassman 
              polylogarithms, and to contribute to the further understanding of  their
              applications to other mathematical fields.  ***
