Abstract    :
              9401380  Bercovici       The proposed work is in three directions. The first is
              in  basic operator theory. The theory of dual algebras will be  applied to
              study pairs of commuting operators. These techniques  were most successful in
              the case of single operators. The second  direction is related to the study of
              interpolation and lifting  problems associated with the concept of structured
              singular  value. These issues are interesting as problems in operator  theory
              but they also have applications for control theory. The  third direction is a
              development of earlier work in the framework  of Voiculescu's free harmonic
              analysis. The convolution theory in  this analysis still has many aspects which
              are not well  understood. For instance, the domain of attraction to the 
              semicircle distribution in the central limit theorem is not  known. Problems on
              large deviations have not been studied in this  context.       This project
              lies at the interface of several branches of  mathematics (operator theory,
              probability, function theory). Much  of the project involves a better
              understanding and new results in  these disciplines. Further, parts of the
              project have a  significant interaction with control theory and systems theory,
               and the results might have an impact on calculations related to  the control
              of large systems.  ***
