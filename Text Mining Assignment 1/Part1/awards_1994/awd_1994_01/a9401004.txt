Abstract    :
              Benson            This award supports work on representations and cohomology of 
              finite and compact Lie groups.  There are three areas which will be
              investigated.  The  first is an investigation of the representation theory and
              cohomology of finite groups,  primarily over fields of prime characteristic. 
              The second involves understanding the  cohomology of compact Lie groups, by
              extending current methods from the finite case.   The third  is aimed at
              constructing maps between classifying spaces of finite and  compact Lie groups.
                        The research supported concerns the representation  theory of finite
              groups.  A group is an algebraic object used to study transformations.  
              Because of this, groups are a fundamental tool in physics, chemistry and
              computer  science as well as mathematics.  Representation theory is an
              important method for  determining the structure of groups. ***
