Abstract    :
              9401253  Quigg       This proposal is a continuation of a study of
              noncommutative  duality for C*-dynamical systems. The primary objective is to 
              further explore the links among Landstad duality, twisted  coactions, induced
              C*-algebras, and crossed product duality.  Further analysis will be made of the
              relation between discrete  coactions and compact actions.       The general
              area of mathematics of this project has its  basis in the theory of algebras of
              Hilbert space operators.  Operators can be thought of as finite or infinite
              matrices of  complex numbers. Special types of operators are often put 
              together in an algebra, naturally called an operator algebra.  These abstract
              objects have a surprising variety of applications.  For example, they play a
              key role in knot theory, which in turn  is currently being used to study the
              structure of DNA, and they  are of fundamental importance in noncommutative
              geometry, which  is becoming of increasing importance in mathematical physics.
