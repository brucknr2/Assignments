Abstract    :
              9401466  Rogawski       This award funds the investigations of Professor
              Jonathan  Rogawski in the theory of automorphic representations and its 
              relations with number theory.  The work has three objectives;   first to
              construct motives for Hilbert modular forms of a  particular weight,  second to
              prove a conjecture relating the  existence of Heisenberg models to the
              multiplicity pairing,  and  finally to construct a correspondence between
              certain  representations of unitary groups with representations of the  general
              linear group.       This research is in a part of number theory generally known
               as the Langland's program.  Number theory is the study of the  properties of
              the whole numbers and is the oldest branch of  mathematics. From the beginning
              problems in number theory have  furnished a driving force in creating new
              mathematics in other  diverse parts of the discipline. The Langland's program
              is a  general philosophy that connects number theory with calculus;  it 
              embodies the modern approach to the study of whole numbers.   Modern number
              theory is very technical and deep, but it has had  astonishing applications in
              areas like theoretical computer  science and coding theory.
