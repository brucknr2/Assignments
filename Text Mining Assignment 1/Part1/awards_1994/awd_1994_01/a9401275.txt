Abstract    :
              9401275  Jech       This research project will concentrate on set theory and on 
              applications of set theory in algebra.  The major topics of  research will
              include left-distributive algebras, elementary  embeddings, stationary sets,
              the theory of large cardinals,  applications of forcing, the singular cardinals
              problem and the  theory of possible cofinalities, countably complete filters
              and  ideals, infinitary combinatorics, and problems in Boolean  algebras.      
               This research deals with the abstract mathematical  discipline called SET
              THEORY.  Set theory serves as the  foundation for other mathematical
              disciplines such as topology,  measure theory and functional analysis.  Its
              study of abstract  infinite sets provides an invaluable insight into the
              expressive  power of modern mathematics and its limitations.  In particular, 
              modern set theory, with its emphasis on independence proofs and  the theory of
              large cardinals, enables one to establish  provability or unprovability and
              analyze the complexity of  mathematical conjectures.  ***
