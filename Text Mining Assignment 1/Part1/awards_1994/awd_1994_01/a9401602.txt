Abstract    :
              9401602  Yasbin  This award supported is requested for the 38th annual meeting
              of the Wind River conference on Procaryotic Genetics, to be held at the Wind
              River Ranch, Estes Park, Colorado, June 4-8, 1994.  This conference is
              primarily concerned with the biology of genetic exchange systems and the
              genetics of a variety of procaryotic and eukaryotic systems, and is the major
              annually occurring meeting devoted to this subject area.  One significant
              feature of these meetings is their accessibility to graduate students and
              post-doctoral students, whose travel funds frequently are limited. 
              Specifically to address this problem,  funds are provided for travel and
              support scholarships to facilitate the attendance of graduate students and
              post-doctoral students working in various areas that comprise prokaryotic
              genetics.    %%%  This is the major meeting where the genetics of variety of
              bacteria are discussed.  ***
