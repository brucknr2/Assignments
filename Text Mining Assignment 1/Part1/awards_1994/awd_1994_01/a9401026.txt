Abstract    :
              9401026  Hida       This award funds the continuing research of Professor Haruzo
               Hida in modular forms.  Professor Hida hopes to construct a  theory of modular
              forms over non-real fields that parallels the  theory over totally real fields.
               The theory over totally real  fields is richer because one can bring powerful
              geometric methods  into the study.       This is research in the field of
              number theory.  Number  theory is basically the study of whole numbers.  The
              research  done under this award studies properties of the whole numbers by 
              encoding them into functions called modular forms. Number theory  is among the
              oldest fields of mathematics,  yet it has always  played an important role in
              choosing directions for the rest of  the subject.  Within the last half
              century, the study of whole  numbers has become doubly important as the theory
              has been used  to develop new algorithms for computer science and to construct 
              new error correcting codes for electronics.
