Abstract    :
              9401931  Drummond  The PIs intend to study the way the host magmas interacted 
              with the xenoliths, the macro and micro deformation  features, modal
              abundances, mineral major and trace element  chemistries, isotopic (Sr, Nd, Pb,
              O, H, and Be) analyses,  and fluid and melt inclusion studies (Raman).  All
              work will  be carried out in the context of careful attention to  textural,
              mineralogical, and petrological evidence used to  distinguish those parts of
              the xenoliths that record  different stages in mantle history.  Suites of
              nodules for  this study are from several localities.  Xenoliths from  Batan
              Island, Luzon arc, Philippines, and Avachinsky  Volcano, Kamchatka arc will be
              the focus of detailed  isotopic and trace element work.  Xenoliths recovered
              from  Kharchinsky, Shiveluch, Valovayam (Kamchatka arc), and  Chirinkotan
              (Kuriles arc) will be subjected to preliminary  chemical studies to form a
              solid base for more detailed work  later, should such studies be warranted. 
              The PIs hope to  address questions concerning the composition of the mantle 
              prior to metasomatism, the origin of high-field strength  element anomalies
              characteristic of arc volcanics, the  nature of the metasomatizing agent, and
              the age of the  metasomatic event.
