Abstract    :
              9401276  Gellman  This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface
               Chemistry Program, applies the concepts of physical organic  chemistry to the
              study of surface reaction kinetics.  The  electronic structure of the
              transition state of several surface  reactions will be probed by fluorine
              substitution.  The  substituent effect on such reactions as hydride
              elimination,  deprotonation, and alkyl coupling on copper surfaces will be 
              explored using electron spectroscopic and kinetic probes.  Quantum chemical
              calculations will be carried out to compare  with the results of the kinetic
              and thermodynamic measurements  which form the bulk of the proposed work.  This
              approach may be  widely applicable to the study of catalytic and
              electrochemical  reaction chemistry.  %%%  An understanding of the energetics
              of the transition state in  surface chemical reactions would help to design
              efficient  catalytic systems.  This research project, supported in the 
              Analytical and Suface Chemistry Program, addresses this  question
              experimentally and theoretically.  By using proven  methods of physical organic
              chemistry, the substituent effect  will be exploited to probe the transition
              state in a number of  important surface chemical reactions.  ***
