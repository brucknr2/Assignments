Abstract    :
              9401094  Cifelli   This is a proposal to collect mammals and small vertebrates
              from the Cedar Mountain formation of Utah, a site known to date from the Early
              Cretaceous period.  This time period is not well represented by fossils in
              existing collections, and the Cedar Mountain fossil fauna is known to be rich. 
                The project will yield data to great interest for studies of paleoecology and
               biogeography because dramatic changes have occurred in the faunas of the Late
              Jurassic and Late Cretaceous, the periods preceding and following that
              represented by the Cedar Mountain fauna.  These changes are presumed to be a
              result of the origin of flowering plants during this span.  The collections
              will provide a basis for evaluation of contrasting hypotheses on the origin, 
              paleobiogeography, and phylogeny of mammals and other microvertebrates.  The
              fauna of the Cedar Mountain Formation will also complement a relatively
              complete sequence of assemblages from the Late Cretaceous of Utah for
              documenting long-term taxonomic, morphologic, and compositional changes in the
              terrestrial biota during a critical phase of its history.
