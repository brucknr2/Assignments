Abstract    :
              9401024       Grosz        This award provides support for the development of a
              new  generation computing facility to support experimental research in 
              ubiquitous information systems.  The equipment infrastructure  includes
              Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks, file servers  capable of handling
              video, and graphics workstations with advanced  human interface capabilities.  
                     The research topics to be explored span the development of  new
              technologies that support rapid transmission of large amounts  of data between
              computer systems to the development of more  flexible and adaptable systems for
              humsn-computer communication.
