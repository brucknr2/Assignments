Abstract    :
              9401509  Delzell       This awards supports the research of Professors C.
              Delzell  and J. Madden to work in real algebraic geometry. In particular  they
              will try to extend their theory of local real algebraic  geometry from
              dimension two to dimension 3. They will also study  consequences of their
              recent proof of the existence of a  completely normal spectral space which is
              not the real spectrum  of any commutative ring.       This research is in the
              field of algebraic geometry, one of  the oldest parts of modern mathematics,
              but one which blossomed  to the point where it has, in the past 10 years,
              solved problems  that have stood for centuries. Originally, it treated figures 
              defined in the plane by the simplest of equations, namely  polynomials. Today,
              the field uses methods not only from algebra,  but also from analysis and
              topology, and conversely it is  extensively used in those fields.  Moreover it
              has proved itself  useful in fields as diverse as physics, theoretical computer
               science, cryptography, coding theory and robotics.
