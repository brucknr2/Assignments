              shipboard technician activities associated with the research vessel CAPE

              131 days of NSF-funded research, primarily in the Chesapeake Bay and coastal
              waters of the northeastern U.S.  UD technicians will be responsible for
              operating and repairing instruments while at sea, maintaining instruments
              ashore and assisting with scientific operations necessary before and after
              cruises.
