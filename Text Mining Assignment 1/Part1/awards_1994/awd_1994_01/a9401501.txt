Abstract    :
              MacPherson             This award supports the work of Prof. Robert MacPherson 
              by funding a post-doctoral researcher, Dr. Kai Behrend.  Dr.  Behrend will
              continue his successful development of an l-adic  theory of stacks.  He is
              interested in developing trace formula  and finding further applications for
              those that have already been  established.              This is research in the
              field of algebraic geometry,  one of  the richest parts of modern mathematics. 
              Algebraic  geometry has had a  revolutionary flowering in the past quarter 
              century. Originally this type of geometry dealt with figures that  could be
              defined in the plane by  the simplest equations, namely  polynomials. Nowadays
              the field studies the most complicated  kinds of mathematical object and makes
              use of methods not only  from algebra, but from analysis and topology.  Perhaps
              because of  this extreme generality, it is finding application in many fields  
              as diverse as in physics, theoretical computer science, and  robotics. ***
