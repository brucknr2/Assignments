Abstract    :
              9401681  Whitworth  This project is a contribution to the Indian Ocean
              Expedition (IOE)  of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE).  In it, the
              PIs  will deploy three current meter mooring arrays along 20 degrees  South in
              the Indian Ocean.  In addition, they will oversee the  execution of the
              hydrographic survey along the same line, denoted  as WOCE section I-3, and
              participate in the collection and analysis  of data on WOCE sections I-8S and
              I-9S.  Finally, Conductivity,  Temperature, Depth (CTD) stations related to the
              deployment and  recovery of the moorings will also be made.  Objectives are to 
              describe water characteristics, velocity structure, and transport  of the three
              systems of deep western boundary currents postulated  to exist in the region. 
              The observations will provide the  foundation for the first direct measurement
              of the meridional  overturning rate in the Indian Ocean.
