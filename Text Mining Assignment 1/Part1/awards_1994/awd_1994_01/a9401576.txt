Abstract    :
              9401576   Doty                This award supports work on the study of
              representations of  reductive groups in zero and non-zero characteristics. 
              Reductive  monoids will be investigated for possible applications to the 
              groups.  The general linear groups will play a central role in  this
              investigation.                The research supported concerns the
              representation theory of  reductive groups.  A group is an algebraic object
              used to study  transformations.  Because of this, groups are a fundamental tool
               in physics, chemistry and computer science as well as  mathematics. 
              Representation theory is an important method for  determining the structure of
              groups.
