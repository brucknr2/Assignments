Abstract    :
              9401354  Verchota       This project in mathematical analysis focuses on the 
              application of methods of harmonic analysis to the study of  partial
              differential equations.  Work will be done on the  formation of estimates of
              solutions to boundary value problems of  elliptic operators with constant
              coefficients.  The tools  employed include singular integrals and Sobolev and
              Hardy spaces  on lower dimensional Lipschitz surfaces.  The lower dimensional 
              theory, which is just developing, seeks to yield new maximum  principles for
              higher order equations and systems.  One of the  underlying goals of the
              research is that of understanding which  properties of dilation invariant
              solutions might be considered  operator independent.  Classical theory fails to
              distinguish  those properties of solutions that are operator dependent from 
              those that are domain dependent.  Boundary value problems such as  the
              Dirichlet problem are to be generalized in an algebraic way  to higher order
              operators and systems that may not conform to  intuition on how values at the
              boundary should control values  inside a domain.       Partial differential
              equations form a basis for mathematical  modeling of the physical world.  The
              role of mathematical  analysis is not so much to create the equations as it is
              to  provide qualitative and quantitative information about the  solutions. 
              This may include answers to questions about  uniqueness, smoothness and growth.
               In addition, analysis often  develops methods for approximation of solutions
              and estimates on  the accuracy of these approximations.  ***
