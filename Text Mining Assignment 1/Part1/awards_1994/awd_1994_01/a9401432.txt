Abstract    :
              94-01432  Geisler    This project is the first phase of a comprehensive national
              study of federal laboratories which will identify the main variables that
              influence the actual transfer of technology from the laboratories to industrial
              companies.  Specifically, the study focuses organizational and managerial
              factors, in combination with factors related to technical capabilities and
              attitudes and orientation of researchers and managers in federal laboratories. 
              These factors will be classified as "barriers" or "facilitators" to the
              transfer process, and their level of importance in influencing the successful
              transfer will be established the research significance is in the study's
              approach which combines organizational factors with attitudinal and technical
              characteristics of researchers considered key factors in the successful
              transfer of technology to industrial companies.  The practical significance is
              in the incorporation of the findings from this study into the decision making
              process of the laboratories and industrial companies, as well as other federal
              agencies involved with technology and federal laboratories.    The methodology
              includes the selection of a sample of researchers and managers from federal
              laboratories.  In phase 1 questionnaire will be mailed to the sample and the
              results analyzed.  In phase two a sample of industrial companies will be
              selected and interviews conducted with corporate R & D executives to assess the
              level of success of transfer of technology from the federal laboratories to
              their companies.
