Abstract    :
              Yousten  9401103    This U.S.-Brazilian Cooperative Science Program award 
              supports travel expenses of nine U.S. researchers who will  participate in a
              workshop on Enthomopathogenic Bacteria. Ten  Brazilian and a Colombian
              investigator will also participate  in the workshop, to be held May 23-26, at
              the Instituto  Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.    The use of synthetic
              chemical insecticides , while highly  successful, presents problems of toxicity
              to humans and  other non-target organisms, environmental pollution,and 
              development of resistant target organisms.  As a result,  interest in the use
              of naturally occurring microbial  insecticides has increased greatly. U.S.
              scientists are  leaders in the area of bacterial toxicity, while Brazilian 
              scientists have developed fermentation methods that are also  essential to the
              mass production of microbial insecticides.  Collaborative efforts at defining
              pathogenic properties of  bacteria, the mechanisms of action of the
              microorganisms and  possibilities for mass production will benefit all
              countries  involved.  It is expected that several new research  collaborations
              of mutual interest will emerge from this  workshop.
