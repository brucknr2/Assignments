Abstract    :
              9401770  Batiza       This award provides partial funding for the acquisition 
              of an inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS)  system to be
              installed and operated in the School of Ocean  and Earth Science and Technology
              at the University of  Hawaii. The institution is committed to providing the 
              remaining funds necessary for the acquisition. The  instrument will be used to
              measure the concentration of  elements and isotopes in a wide variety of
              natural solid and  fluid samples. Approximately 30 research scientists will 
              make use of the instrument's rapid and accurate chemical  analytical
              capabilities in their research. Their research  includes projects in the
              general fields of: (1) mid-ocean  ridge processes, (2) processes in active
              back-arc basins and  island arcs, (3) mantle plumes and hotspots, (4) deep 
              interior of the Earth, (5) extraterrestrial materials, (6)  marine mineral
              deposits, (7) marine particulates and  sediments, (8) atmospheric particulates
              and sediment trap  materials, (9) hydrothermal processes, and (10) Ocean 
              drilling related research.   ***
