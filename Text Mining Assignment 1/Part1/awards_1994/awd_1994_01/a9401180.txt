Abstract    :
              9401180  Baggett       The purpose of this project is to continue formulating an
               abstract setting the notions and theorems involved with the  important area of
              wavelet bases and multi-resolution analyses.  Part of the project is to derive
              results about the existence of  wavelets and MRA's, quality of the wavelets and
              MRA's, and  summability results for wavelet expansions. In the abstract 
              context, one may bring to bear the powerful and modern theories  of unitary
              representations, von Neumann algebras, etc. Another  part of the project is to
              use abstract theory to describe the  notion of windowed Fourier transforms,
              which notion can also be  formulated in terms of unitary representation theory
              and  non-commutative harmonic analysis.       Research on Wavelet Theory is an
              incredibly active area of  mathematics. This is due mainly to the powerful
              applications to  important areas involving high performance computing such as
              data  compression and pattern recognition. Usually wavelet theory is 
              approached using the real variable techniques of harmonic  analysis. This
              project is aimed at formulating Wavelet Theory in  an abstract mathematical
              setting. Powerful abstract mathematics  can then be applied to get automatic
              existence and convergence  theorems about wavelets. New insights into the
              fundamental nature  of wavelets will occur. In a reciprocal manner, the salient
               features of wavelets will be reflected to produce new concepts in  abstract
              mathematics.  ***
