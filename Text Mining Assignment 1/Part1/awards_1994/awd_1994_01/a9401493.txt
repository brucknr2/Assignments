Abstract    :
              Verbitsky  9401493       This award supports mathematical research on problems 
              related to function spaces defined on domains in several real or  complex
              variables.  The spaces, developed over the past decade  play a major role in
              the analysis of Calderon-Zygmund and partial  differential operators, are known
              as Triebel-Lizorkin spaces.   They are refinements of the classical Sobolev and
              Besov spaces,   developed because of the crucial role they play in wavelet-type
               decompositions of distributions.  The basis for this work is a  set of
              connections between weighted norm inequalities,  Carleson measures, Besov
              spaces with zero smoothness and  Hardy-Sobolev spaces in the unit of ball in
              complex n-dimensional  space.  It goals are to determine forward and reverse
              embedding  of discrete Triebel-Lizorkin spaces into weighted sequence spaces 
              with p-th poser norms.  In addition, work will be done  characterizing positive
              measures on the line for which the  discrete maximal operator and Hilbert
              transform preserve the  above spaces.  Finally, work will continue on questions
              related  to peak interpolation sets for the ball algebra in terms of the 
              capacity of its subsets.       Studies of the classical function spaces
              expanded from  concerns about their structure to the application to the 
              understanding of basic operators of more applicable analysis.  As  the past two
              decades progressed, the spaces gained their impetus  from differential
              equations, singular operators and wavelets  rather than from functional
              analysis.  This has led to a new  and vigorous blend of mathematical analysis
              exemplified by  this proposal.  ***
