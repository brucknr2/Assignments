Abstract    :
              9401422  Koch       Professor Koch is investigating spin models relevant to the 
               theory of critical phenomena, neural network models related to   disordered
              systems in statistical mechanics and variational   problems for non-periodic
              orbits and configurations. the   techniques and results from previous work on
              hierarchical models   are applied and extended to a larger class of
              ferromagnetic   models. The investigation of neural networks focuses on large  
              general purpose associative memories of the type of Hopfield's   model with
              thermal noise. The third project deals with  variational problems for
              nontrivial orbits and ground states of  dynamical systems and statistical
              mechanics models, respectively.       Professor Koch's work is in the area
              broadly known as   mathematical physics where a deep mathematical understanding
              of  physical models is sought. One of his projects involves an  investigation
              of the renormalization group, where an attempt is  made to understand
              interactions at all length scales  simultaneously. This is one of the most
              important problems in  statistical mechanics and quantum field theory.  ***
