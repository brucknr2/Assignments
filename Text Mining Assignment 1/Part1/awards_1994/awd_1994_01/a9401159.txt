Abstract    :
              9401159  Turner        This award provides support for extending and enhancing a
              broadband multi-  media network to support a set of closely related
              collaborative research  activities in the area of distributed imaging and
              visualization.  The network  will utilize Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)
              technology for the fast  distribution of high-resolution images,
              visualizations, studio-quality video and  multi-rate data.          The
              research topics fall into two categories:  research on enabling  technologies
              such as scalable networks, host/network interfaces supporting  multimedia
              applications, design and analysis of large-scale multimedia  information
              servers, protocols and operating systems, scalable parallel  processing and
              declarative visualization.  And secondly, research on the  application of these
              technologies to real distributed imaging and visualization  systems.
