Abstract    :
              9401324   Nichols                  This award supports fundamental work on the
              study of Hopf  algebras.  The main goal of the project is the solution of 
              Kaplansky's sixth conjecture on Hopf algebras--for a finite  dimensional
              cosemisimple Hopf algebra H defined over an  algebraically closed field, the
              dimension of every simple right  H-comodule divides the dimension of H.  The
              principal  investigator will also study some questions involving symbolic 
              computation which have arisen in connection with the Hopf algebra  work.       
                        This research is concerned with an algebraic object called a  Hopf
              algebra.  While the area is quite technical, Hopf algebras  are becoming of
              increasing interest, even to non mathematicians.   Hopf algebras are useful in
              the type of knot theory that is of  interest to molecular chemists.  Certain
              types of Hopf algebras  are now referred to as quantum groups in recognition of
              their  applications in physics.  Hopf algebras are used to study  differential
              operators and to make combinatorics more like  calculus.
