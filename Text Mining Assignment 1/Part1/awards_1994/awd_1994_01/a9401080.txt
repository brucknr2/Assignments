Abstract    :
              9401080  Ridgeway          This  is  an award under the Grants for Improving 
              Doctoral  Dissertation  Research program.  It is a study  of  some  of  the 
              social  bases for the acceptance or rejection of double standards  for  
              rewarding  performance  of  tasks.   A  series  of   social  psychological
              experiments will be carried out using undergraduate  students, with computers
              used to simulate partners cooperating in  performing an assigned task. Through
              manipulation of the relative  rewards given to subjects and partners and also
              the social status  characteristics  of  partners,  reactions  of  subjects  to 
               the  establishment of a differential reward structure will be studied.      
              Previous work in experimental social psychology has examined  either  how
              standards for evaluating others or individual  reward  expectations  are
              established, but this will be one  of  the  few  attempts  to  study both
              processes simultaneously.   Unlike  some  experiments,  the  results  of this
              project  should  have  direct  implications  for  important real-life
              situations  involving  the  acceptance  or  challenging  of  double  standards 
              for   judging  individual performance.  In addition to the scientific  gains 
              to  be achieved by the research, this award will materially assist  a  highly 
              promising student in completing research  for  the  Ph.D.  dissertation.  Thus 
              it  contributes  to  the  future  scientific  manpower  of  the nation and the
              thorough training  of  the  next  generation of social scientists.  ***
