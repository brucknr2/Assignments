Abstract    :
              9401015  Hsia       This grant supports the research of Professors J. Hsia to 
              work on problems in number theory.  Professor Hsia will continue  to work on
              the arithmetic of integral and hermitian quadratic  forms.  Inparticular he
              will work on strong approximation for  definite spaces and effectiveness
              results.  He also intends to  continue his study of spinor genera.       This
              is research in the field of number theory.   Number  theory starts with the
              whole numbers and questions such as the  divisibility of one whole number by
              another.  It is among the  oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally
              pursued for  purely aesthetic reasons.  However, within the last half century, 
              it has become an essential tool in developing new algorithms for  computer
              science and new error correcting codes for electronics.
