Abstract    :
              9401893  Schwartz       This project is to carry out a survey of wireless
              networking  in Europe.  The principal investigator will carry this out while 
              temporarily based at Imperial College, London.  The results will be  published
              in a journal and will be available to the entire  community.  In addition, the
              handling of multimedia traffic in  wireless networks to high-speed "wired" ATM
              network stressing  network management and control issues will be treated by the
               principal investigator and his collaborators a t Imperial College.  ***
