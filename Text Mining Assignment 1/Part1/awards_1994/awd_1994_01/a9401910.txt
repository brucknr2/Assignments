Abstract    :
              9401910  Semtner    The PI has an operational world ocean circulation model
              which has  been  used to simulate ocean circulation for the period  1985-89. 
              The current project is to test improved physical formulations for  the   
              addition   of   sea   ice,   mixed-layer   dynamics,   and  parameterizations
              of deep overflows and deep convection.    Techniques will be tested for
              incorporating satellite altimeter  data from the Geosat, TOPEX/Poseidon, and
              ERS-1,2 missions into  the model.  Model simulations will be conducted with and
              without  the inclusion of satellite data, including some simulations in 
              near-real time for the WOCE observing period.  In-situ WOCE  observations will
              be used to evaluate the realism of the  simulations.  ***
