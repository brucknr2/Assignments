Abstract    :
              This one year Small Grant for Exploratory Research in the Analytical and  
              Surface Chemistry Program supports the research of Professor Mark   Meyerhoff
              at the University of Michigan, and is focused on the   development of
              porphyrin-based stationary phases for the separation of   members of the
              fullerene family of compounds. The separation   characteristics of the
              porphyrin phases will be altered by changing the   identity of the metal ion
              located within the porphyrin ring, and by   electrochemically controlling the
              oxidation state of the metal center.    Other potential applications include
              polyaromatic hydrocarbon analyses   and peptide separations.    In recent
              years, a new type of chemistry has been developed based on the   discovery of
              the fullerenes.  These are compounds with a framework based   only on carbon
              atoms and which have symmetrical structures, for example,   the soccer
              ball-shaped C60.  These compounds show a great deal of promise   as new
              materials with unique properties, e.g., lubricants.  This   research, supported
              by the Chemistry Division, will allow these new   materials to be characterized
              in much more detail.  These studies will   potentially allow for the isolation
              of large quantities of these unique   species, which is critical for the
              development of new materials based on   these compounds.
