Abstract    :
                  9401772  Nairn  This award is to study the stress analysis of the
              single-fiber  specimens that are used to examine the fiber/matrix interface in 
              composite materials.  Two new methods of analysis will be used to  improve on
              the more commonly used, but inadequate, shear-lag  analysis technique.  The new
              methods can be designated as the  fragmentation and microbond tests.  It is
              expected that accurate  values of the tensile stresses at the fiber/matrix
              interface will  combine with fracture mechanics considerations to yield an
              improved  understanding of this fundamental problem in composite materials.
