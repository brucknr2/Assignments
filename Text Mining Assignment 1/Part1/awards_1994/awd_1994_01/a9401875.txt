Abstract    :
              9401875  Haiman    This award will support the attendance of three postdoctoral 
              fellows and three graduate students, including at least two  women, at the
              Algebraic Combinatorics Conference in honour of  Adriano M. Garsia, to be held
              July 26-29, 1994, in Taormina,  Sicily, Italy.  The purpose of the conference
              is to advance the  use of methods from algebra and algebraic geometry in 
              combinatorics, and particularly to provide exposure to these  methods for
              graduate students and researchers beginning their  careers.      The conference
              will be small and highly focused, with a workshop-  style format.  It will be
              strongly international, with  participants from the U.S., Canada, six European
              countries, and  Israel.  The speakers have been chosen for the influence of
              their  innovations in shaping present research activity in algebraic 
              combinatorics; they represent the leaders in the field.  The  conference is
              expected to result in an exchange of new ideas and  techniques.  With the
              eventual publication of the conference  proceedings, this meeting could have a
              lasting impact on several  parts of mathematics.  * * *
