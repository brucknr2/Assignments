Abstract    :
              9401451  Lipshitz       L. Lipshitz, Z. Robinson and their students will
              continue  their investigation of rigid subanalytic and semianalytic sets  (i.e.
              subanalytic and semianalytic sets over an algebraically  closed field which is
              complete with respect to a non-Archimedean  absolute value).  This
              investigation will entail further work on  the algebra and geometry of the
              rings of separated power series.   Among other topics, they will investigate
              unique factorization,  uniformization, Stein factorization, the singular locus
              theorem,  and sheaf theory over these rings.  Methods to be used will be 
              nonstandard models and quantifier elimination from mathematical  logic,
              together with techniques from commutative algebra and  algebraic geometry.     
               The sets of points in real space defined by systems of  equations and
              inequalities among analytic functions are called  analytic sets.  The
              projection (i.e. the shadow) of such a set on  a lower dimensional subspace is
              called subanalytic.  Real  subanalytic sets arise in several branches of
              mathematics, such  as differential equations and geometry.  Similar classes of
              sets  arise naturally, for example in number theory, over fields  different
              from the real numbers, where the notion of distance has  rather different
              properties.  These sets, however, share many of  the nice properties of their
              real cousins.  Lipshitz, Robinson  and their students will continue their
              investigation of the  properties of these sets, using methods from mathematical
              logic,  commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.  ***
