Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  Klingenberg  CTS-9401293    This is an experimental project on
              electrorheological (ER) fluids, where the use of surfactants is suggested to
              increase the fluids yield stress durability.  A systematic study will be
              undertaken to characterize the ER systems, test their steady-state rheological
              and dynamic oscillatory responses, and identify possible mechanisms in the
              presence of surfactants.  Modeling efforts will be pursued to guide the
              experiments.    If successful, the proposed research program may lead to
              improved ER fluids at a reduced cost, for a variety of applications from
              locomotive industry to sensors.  Another objective of the project is to reduce
              the environmental impact of  those fluids after their use.
