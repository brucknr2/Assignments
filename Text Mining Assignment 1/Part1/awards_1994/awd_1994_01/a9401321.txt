Abstract    :
              9401321  Kolyvagin       This award funds the research of Prof. Victor
              Kolyvagin.   Prof. Kolyvagin works on the theory of Euler systems and their 
              application to number theory.  For a given Euler system, he plans  to extend
              the set of cohomology classes explicitly controlled  locally, and connect them
              to the arithmetic of number fields and  elliptic curves.       This research
              falls under the general heading of number  theory. Number theory is the study
              of the properties of the whole  numbers and is the oldest branch of
              mathematics. From the  beginning problems in number theory have furnished the
              driving  force to creation of new mathematics in almost all parts of the 
              discipline. Prof. Kolyvagin is a leader in the use of geometric  ideas to study
              whole numbers.  This kind of number theory is very  technical and deep, but it
              has had astonishing applications in  areas like theoretical computer science
              and coding theory.
