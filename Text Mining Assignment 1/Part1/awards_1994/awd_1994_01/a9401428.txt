Abstract    :
              9401428 Hochster         This award supports research in commutative algebra and
               algebraic geometry.  The principle investigator will continue investigating
              several long  standing questions in the theory of Noetherian rings, to explore
              the relationship of these  questions with the burgeoning theory of tight
              closure, including its relationship to  absolute integral closures and to
              achieve a better understanding of the geometric  significance  of the condition
              on a ring that all of its ideals be tightly closed.  The  faculty associate
              will study primary decompositions of ideals, tight closure, mixed 
              multiplicities, joint reductions and ideals generated by monomials in a system
              of  parameters in a local ring.         This research is concerned with a
              number of questions  in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.  Algebraic
              geometry studies solutions  of families of polynomial equations.  One can
              either study the geometry of the solution  set or approach problems
              algebraically by investigating certain functions on the solution  set that form
              what is called a commutative ring.  This dual perspective creates a close 
              connection between commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. ***
