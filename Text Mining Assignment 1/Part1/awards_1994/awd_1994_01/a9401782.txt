Abstract    :
              9401782  Chanillo       This award supports mathematical research on problems 
              involving systems of partial differential equations.  The thrust  of the work
              is concerned with how one uses harmonic analysis in  the treatment of linear
              and nonlinear systems.  The equations  arise from several sources.  One is that
              involving the study of  rotating stars.  Work will be done in establishing a
              bifurcation  diagram for the equilibrium solutions of the free energy 
              functional of white dwarfs.  In addition, efforts will be made to  understand
              the free boundary of the critical points of this  energy function.  Other work
              involves the rotational symmetry of  partial differential equations which
              represent 2-dimensional  fluid flow on a sphere and the analysis of where
              symmetry can be  expected to break.  Additional lines of investigation involve 
              inverse problems from magnetohydrodynamics and local solvability  problems for
              linear equations in the real analytic case.       Partial differential
              equations form a basis for mathematical  modeling of the physical world.  The
              role of mathematical  analysis is not so much to create the equations as it is
              to  provide qualitative and quantitative information about the  solutions. 
              This may include answers to questions about  uniqueness, smoothness and growth.
               In addition, analysis often  develops methods for approximation of solutions
              and estimates on  the accuracy of these approximations.  ***
