Abstract    :
              9401211  Grace, Nabil F.    This research presents a new concept dealing with
              the development  of a corrosion-free bridge system that requires no shoring or 
              forms and has superior characteristics compared to existing  bridge systems. 
              The non-corrosive bridge system will be built  of:  (i) pre-cast modified
              double tree (DT) panels, (ii) cast-in-  place fiber reinforced decks, connected
              to the DT through fiber  reinforced shear connectors, and (iii) external
              post-tension  cables made of advanced composite strands.  This bridge would be 
              adapted to rural/short span bridges.  An analytical and  experimental study
              will be conducted by the junior and senior  undergraduate students to examine
              the static, dynamic, fatigue  and ultimate load characteristics of the new
              bridge system.  ***
