Abstract    :
              9401780  Knop                  The main goal of this project is to generalize
              the theory of  symmetric spaces to other spaces where one makes only one 
              assumption on the symmetry group:  It should be a semisimple Lie  group.  Under
              this condition one is able to define the notion of  a flat and of a little Weyl
              group.  There exist three different  constructions of the Weyl group.  The
              first is by looking at the  boundary of the space.  For spherical varieties,
              there is a  canonical construction of a compactification and one part of the 
              project is to prove that it has no singularities.  The second  construction is
              accomplished by looking at the action of a  certain subgroup of the symmetric
              group.  The principal  investigator will find a way to reconstruct all other
              data needed  to describe all compactifications of the space.  Finally, there 
              is a construction accomplished by looking at the moment map on  the cotangent
              bundle of the space.  A major problem of the  project is to obtain a better
              understanding of the moment map.            Many different algebraic objects
              can be represented as  algebraic sets of transformations of other algebraic
              objects.   Through these representations their structure can be determined.  
              This project is concerned with the representation theory of  infinite
              dimensional Lie algebras.  The study of these algebras  has applications
              throughout mathematics and mathematical physics.  ***
