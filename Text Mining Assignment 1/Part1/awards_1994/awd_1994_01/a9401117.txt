Abstract    :
              9401117  Smith  This proposal provides for continued operation of an armored
              T-28  aircraft and sensors as a national facility for use by the  atmospheric
              research community.  The aircraft is uniquely suited  for research into clouds,
              thunderstorms and hailstone processes.   The cooperative agreement provides for
              staffing, management,  testing, operation, and maintenance of the T-28 and
              hanger  facility.  The aircraft is then available for research grant 
              opportunities through university proposals.  Grant awardees receive  access to
              the T-28 through approval by NSF on advice from the  Facilities Advisory
              Council.  The aircraft and data analysis  becomes available in support of
              research projects requiring  penetration of convective storms, such as VORTEX
              and RACES.  ***
