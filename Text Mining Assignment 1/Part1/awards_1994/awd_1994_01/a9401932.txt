Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  C. Crowe  9401932    The P. I. will conduct research and teaching at
              the Institute for Metal Research of the University of Bremen, Germany, in the
              area of Spray forming technology, with application to net-shape manufacturing. 
              The visit will last four months.  In this time interval, a WSU graduate student
              will visit the Institute for two weeks.  The host institute in Germany is a
              leader in the development of spray forming technology and has an active program
              on metal spray atomization.  The P.I. has expertise in the theoretical and
              numerical simulation areas.  It is expected that the P. I. and his student will
              benefit from their interaction with the German counterpart, and will develop a
              new program at the WSU after his return in the U.S.  The P.I. received
              financial support for his stay in Germany from the host institution.  Two
              components of the research will be further developed by the P.I. after hi
              re-entry back in his home institute:  "Disintegration of Molten Metal Stream by
              Impinging Gas Jets" and "Distribution of Thermal Energy in the Spray Cone for
              Spray Forming Applications".    The project has both scientific and
              technological relevance in the areas of metal spray and net-shape
              manufacturing.  ***
