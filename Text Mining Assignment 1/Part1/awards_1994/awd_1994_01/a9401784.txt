Abstract    :
              9401784  Werner       Professor Werner proposes to continue her research in
              Banach  space theory and convexity theory. In convexity theory she wants  to
              investigate further properties of floating and illumination  bodies of convex
              bodies as well as their connection with affine  surface area and approximation
              of convex bodies by polytopes. In  Banach space theory she plans to continue
              her work on problems  related to the Radon Nikodym property.       A solid body
              is called convex in case a line segment joining  two of its points stays within
              the body. Convex bodies can  frequently be described as intersections of nice
              convex sets such  as half-planes. One of the questions considered here is
              whether a  convex body can be nicely approximated by convex bodies having  only
              a finite number of vertices. The approximation is to be good  in the sense that
              volumes of the approximating bodies are close  to the volume of the original
              body or in the sense that their  surface areas are close. The second project
              involves abstract  mathematics that has applications to probability theory.
