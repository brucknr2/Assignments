Abstract    :
              Rallis       This award supports the research of Professor S. Rallis to  work in
              automorphic functions.  He intends to work on applications  of the trace
              formula to special values of L-functions. He also  intends to study dual
              reductive pairs in exceptional groups.       Modular forms arose out of
              Non-Euclidean geometry in the  middle of the nineteenth century.  Both
              mathematicians and  physicists have thus long realized that many objects of
              fundamental  importance are non-Euclidean in their basic nature.  This field is
               principally concerned with questions about the whole numbers, but  in its use
              of geometry and analysis, it retains connection to its  historical roots and
              thus to problems in areas as diverse as gauge  theory in theoretical physics
              and coding theory in information  theory. ***
