Abstract    :
              9401028  Brydges       The proposal is to study problems in the following
              related  areas: (1)Models of polymers with attractive self interactions.  (2)
              Infrared behavior of weakly perturbed Gaussian measures  arising in statistical
              mechanics of systems that are near a  second order phase transition. (3)
              Epsilon expansions for models  with nearly Gaussian fixed points for the
              renormalization group.  (4) a perturbative study of the renormalization group
              evolution  of the extrinsic geometry of target manifolds in the nonlinear 
              sigma model. (5) Non-perturbative renormalization group for  strong coupling
              problems such as the non-linear sigma model. The  theory of elementary
              particles, the prediction of the size and  shape of long chain molecules in
              solution, and the study of phase  transitions are related problems from the
              view of mathematics;  they require a calculus for the approximate evaluation of
               integrals over spaces of infinite dimension. In the 1970's the  Nobel Laureate
              K. Wilson, made fundamental progress in this  calculus, which is called the
              renormalization group. He  left mathematicians with the challenge of filling in
              his many  leaps of faith and creating a systematic theory. The first three 
              parts ofthis proposal hope to achieve this for a class of  integrals that are
              almost close to Gaussian integrals - a special  class that can be evaluated
              exactly. The last two parts are more  speculative attempts to create the same
              theory for integrals that  are much further from being equal to Gaussian
              integrals.  ***
