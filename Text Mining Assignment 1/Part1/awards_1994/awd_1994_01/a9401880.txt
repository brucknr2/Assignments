Abstract    :
              ***  Ranade  9401880     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II
              project will investigate the gas phase synthesis of alumina powder in turbulent
              jet aerosol reactors. During Phase I, it was demonstrated that particles in the
              size range of 40-100 nm could be produced at outputs of 2 gm/hour. During Phase
              II, the goal will be to modify the reactor setup and operating conditions to
              obtain particles in the 10-40 nm size range at outputs of up to 200 gm/hour.
              The computer model developed during Phase I will be extended to include
              particle and turbulent flow dynamics. Infrared measurements will be made to
              obtain the global kinetic rates for aluminum chloride reaction with oxygen.
              While the focus will be on alumina synthesis, during Phase II an effort will be
              made to demonstrate the versatility of this technique for other oxide and
              non-oxide materials such as zinc oxide, titanium dioxide, silicon nitride and
              multicomponents.   High purity and doped oxides and non-oxide materials in the
              nanometer size range find extensive application in high temperature ceramics,
              catalysis and photonics/electronics. Nanosized alumina, specifically, will have
              potential commercial applications as a high surface area stable catalyst
              support, super tough envelope for advanced lamps, and as a crack resistant
              structural material.  ***
