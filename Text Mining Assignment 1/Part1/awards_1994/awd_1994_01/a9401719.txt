Abstract    :
              Rader      This award supports the work of Professor Cary Rader in the   general
              field of Number Theory,  in particular the Langland's   program.  Professor
              Rader is attempting to develop a local   harmonic analysis along the lines of
              Rallis and Jacquet.  This   will provide additional tools to the study of
              automorphic forms.      Number Theory is the study of the properties of the
              whole numbers   and is the oldest branch of mathematics. From the beginning  
              problems in number theory have furnished the driving force to   creation of new
              mathematics in almost all parts of the   discipline. The Langland's program is
              a general philosophy that   connects number theory with calculus.  Modern
              number theory is   very technical and deep, but it has had astonishing
              applications   in areas like theoretical computer science and coding theory.
