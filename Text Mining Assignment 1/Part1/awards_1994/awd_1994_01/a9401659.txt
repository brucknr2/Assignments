Abstract    :
              9401659  Carpenter  The proposed research will design, develop, analyze, and
              apply  neural network architectures for stable recognition coding and 
              prediction.  One set of projects will focus on new unsupervised ART  (Adaptive
              Resonance Theory) and supervised ARTMAP systems to  support distributed
              recognition codes that are stable under  training regimes with either fast or
              slow learning.  Typically, the  pattern of activity of a recognition code is
              distributed when there   is little reason to select one category over another,
              as might  occur early in a learning process.  This pattern becomes more 
              compressed as categories are more sharply defined through  experience. 
              Generalization and storage capacity of the ART neural  networks will be greatly
              increased by the distributed coding  capability.  Related work will focus on
              the computational  requirements of distributed search and on spatio-temporal 
              recognition problems.
