Abstract    :
                  9401518  Cowin  The objective of this research is to study the mechanism
              whereby  certain symmetry properties of the elasticity tensors develop in 
              nature when there is no obvious reason for them to occur.  This may  reflect a
              response to cyclic loadings rather than simply static  conditions.  Two natural
              composites, bone and wood, have been shown  to exhibit this behavior and the
              evaluation as to why this occurs  may prove profitable for man-made composite
              design.  This raises  the question: has nature devised this particular
              mechanism for  mitigating the damaging effects of repeated cyclic loadings in
              bone  and trees?  ***
