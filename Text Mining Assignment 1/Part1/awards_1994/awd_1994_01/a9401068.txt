Abstract    :
              Theoretical research at the interface of elementary particle  and nuclear
              physics will investigate a new set of  calculational techniques, called charge
              overlap, on  computers at the National Center for Supercomputing  Applications
              (NCSA).  Charge overlap techniques have the  potential to allow us to do
              precise, controlled and complete  calculations of the internal structure of
              particles composed  of quarks and antiquarks.  Using these methods, the
              internal  structure of pions and other mesons will be investigated  from first
              principles.  In addition, using more traditional  computer simulation
              techniques, an improved calculation of  the neutron's electric charge
              distribution will be made.  This calculation is particularly significant
              because of it's  relevance to the experimental program at the Continuous 
              Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF).  CEBAF will  eventually make the
              world's most precise measurements of  this distribution; theory and experiment
              can then be  compared in a meaningful, fundamental way.
