Abstract    :
              This Phase-II research examines sodium-sulfur battery, a leading candiadate for
              application in electric vehicles.  A critical component in sodium-sulfur
              battery is the electrolyte, Na-B-alumina.  In the state-of-the-art
              sodium-sulfur batteries, electrolyte thickness is approximately 1.5 mm which
              contributes nearly 40% to cell specific resistance.  Two approaches are
              proposed to favricate thin (20 to 100 um) Na-B-alumina membranes which can
              reduce electrolyte resistance by a factor of - 30.  This should substantially
              increase power density and energy efficiency.  The two techniques proposed are:
              1.) electrochemical vapor deposition (EVD), and 2.) fabricate thin membranes of
               Na-B-alumina by direct conversion of a-aluminia ; 3.) measure conduction
              properties of thin membranes; 4.) explore the current carrying capacity of
              Na-B-alumina membranes in electrochemical tests by sodium-sodium tests;
              5.)explore the mechanism and the kinetics of the EVD and direct conversion
              processes, and 6.) supply thin electrolytes to a battery developer for
              evaluation in sodium-sulfur cells.
