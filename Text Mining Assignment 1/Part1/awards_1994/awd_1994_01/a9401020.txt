Abstract    :
              9401020  Kappeler       This award supports mathematical research focusing on 
              infinite systems of differential equations known as Hamiltonian  systems.  They
              derive from models of physical systems and  nonlinear partial differential
              equations obtained through  variational principles.  Work to be done includes
              the analysis of  the symplectic structure of the phase space of completely 
              integrable Hamiltonian systems to help understand Hamiltonian  perturbations. 
              Studies of regularized determinants of elliptic  operators will also be carried
              out.  They appear in modern  physics (functional integrals) as well as in
              geometry and  topology (torsion and eta-invariants).  This work continues 
              efforts to extend results on asymptotic expansions of the  logarithm of the
              determinant of one-parameter families  of pseudodifferential operators.  A
              third line of  investigation concerns the investigation of microlocal smoothing
               properties for a large class of linear and nonlinear systems of  dispersive
              evolution equations of Schrodinger type.  Finally,  work will bedone on
              spectral problems and related inverse  problems for Schrodinger operators on
              line bundles over tori and  Heisenberg manifolds.       Partial differential
              equations form a basis for  mathematical modeling of the physical world.  The
              role of  mathematical analysis is not so much to create the equations as  it is
              to provide qualitative and quantitative information about  the solutions.  This
              may include answers to questions  about uniqueness, smoothness and growth.  In
              addition, analysis  often develops methods for approximation of solutions and 
              estimates on the accuracy of these approximations.  ***
