Abstract    :
              9401673  Ciesielski    The primary objective of this U.S.-Polish workshop
              proposed by  Krzysztof Ciesielski of West Virginia University is to enable US 
              and Polish mathematicians to present the results of their most  recent research
              in the area of real analysis.  The past decade  has witnessed a reemergence of
              real analysis as one of the  fundamental subdisciplines of mathematics.  Long
              taught as a core  course at the undergraduate and graduate levels, classical
              real  analysis is regaining its more traditional role at the  intellectual root
              of both modern applied and pure mathematics.   Another aim of the workshop is
              to provide the participants with  an opportunity to interact and gain a deeper
              understanding of the  ideas presented at the workshop and identify new areas
              for  further research in the field of real analysis.      This project in
              mathematics fulfills the program objectives of  advancing scientific knowledge
              by enabling leading experts in the  U.S. and Poland to combine complementary
              efforts and capabilities  in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on
              the basis of  equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.  ***
