Abstract    :
              9401571  Sarnak       This award supports Prof. Peter Sarnak's study of the fine
               structure of the spectrum of the Laplacian for arithmetic  quotients of
              symmetric spaces.  These problems turn out to be  related to a number of
              central problems in the analytic theory of  numbers.  They have also received
              attention from Physicists  working in Quantum Chaos.       This is research in
              the field of number theory.  Number  theory is basically the study of whole
              numbers.  The research  done under this award studies properties of the whole
              numbers by  encoding them into the functions of calculus. Number theory is 
              among the oldest fields of mathematics,  yet it has always played  an important
              role in choosing directions for the rest of the  subject.  Within the last half
              century, the study of whole  numbers has become doubly important as the theory
              has been used  to develop new algorithms for computer science and to construct 
              new error correcting codes for electronics.
