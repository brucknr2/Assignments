Abstract    :
              9401777  Soffer       Two main topics will be investigated. In the Cauchy
              problem  for the nonlinear wave equation, the results of Ginibre-Soffer-  Velo
              on the critical power nonlinear wave equation which are  complete for the
              radial case will be further developed to include  the general data. It is based
              on applying new Lebesgue pth power  bounds which allow the control of the
              p-norm of a function in  terms of singular weighted norms and partial
              regularity. In the  theory of three body dispersive systems a new class of
              dilations,  deformed by various partitions of unity to cluster decompositions 
              will be used. This will allow proofs of local decay and other  spectral
              properties of three body dispersive equations.       Modern physics, quantum
              mechanics and relativity, is a  product of the twentieth century. It is founded
              firmly in the  last century's attempt to address the microstructure of matter 
              and to come to grips with the concept of action-at-a distance, 
              electro-magnetism, and heat radiation. The mathematical  foundations for these
              developments collectively called  mathematical physics, ranges from detailed
              analysis of  Schroedinger operators, which governs the dynamics of particles, 
              to unified field theory, which attempts to unite the four known  forces into a
              single force.  ***
