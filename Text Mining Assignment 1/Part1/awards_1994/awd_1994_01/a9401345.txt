Abstract    :
              The Principal Investigator will study sums of independent random  variables. 
              The research will focus primarily on identifying the  best possible constants
              in inequalities for moments and tail  probabilities for such sums.  The case of
              randomly stopped sums  will be investigated as well.  The Principal
              Investigator will study certain problems concerning  sums of random variables. 
              A primary focus of the proposed  research is to establish precise quantitative
              information on the  behavior of such sums.  A more complex situation, in which
              a  number of summands is itself a random quantity, will be  investigated as
              well.
