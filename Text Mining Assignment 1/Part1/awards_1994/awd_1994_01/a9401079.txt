Abstract    :
              9401079  Huang       The proposer has classified up to flow equivalence all 2- 
              component shifts of finite type. He has recently classified   n-component
              shifts of finite type when 1 is not an eigenvalue of  the defining matrix. The
              project is to complete the  classification for general n-component shifts of
              finite type by   proving a crucial "two-sided" realization theorem which may
              also   have a new implication to C*-algebras. Moreover, based on the   existing
              results, the proposer intends to study (almost) flow   equivalence of sofic
              shifts, of stochastic Markov shifts and of  the more general setting of Laurent
              polynomial matrices.  Especially, he plans to explore more interesting
              relations  between flow equivalence and C*-algebras, including a conjecture  he
              made for the classification of non-simple Cuntz-Krieger  algebras associated to
              2-component shifts of finite type.       This project involves research in
              ergodic theory. Ergodic  theory in general concerns understanding the average
              behavior of  systems whose dynamics is too complicated or chaotic to be 
              followed in microscopic detail. Under the heading of "dynamics"  can be placed
              the modern theory of how groups of abstract  transformations act on smooth
              spaces. In this way ergodic theory  makes contact with geometry and algebra in
              their quests to  clasify flows and algebraic structures.  ***
