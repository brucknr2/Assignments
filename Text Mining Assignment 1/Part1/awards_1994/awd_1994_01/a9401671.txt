Abstract    :
              9401671  Wexler      This award is under the International Junior Investigator 
              and Postdoctoral Fellows Program, which enables U.S.  scientists and engineers
              to conduct three to twelve months  of research abroad at research centers of
              proven excellence.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint 
              research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities,  expertise and
              experimental conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month
              postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Mark Wexler to work with Dr. Jean
              Zinn-Justin  at the Centre D'Etudes de Saclay.    Dr. Wexler's research is the
              study of random surfaces using  the technique of matrix models.  He proposes to
              study random  surfaces imbedded in physically interesting dimensions such  as 3
              and 4, making use of insights derived from infinite  dimensional matrix models
              which exhibit mean-field behavior.  The study has the potential to make the
              theory of random  surfaces a valuable tool for research into fluctuating 
              membranes, quantum chromodynamics (QCD), and other areas.  ***
