Abstract    :
              9401546  Lin       This award supports mathematical research on problems in 
              nonlinear partial differential equations, variational calculus  and geometric
              measure theory.  In the first part, work will be  done analyzing singularities
              which contain the generalized  version of Reifenberg's theorem and its
              applications, the p-  harmonic mapping approach to Ginzburg-Landau vertices and
              the  study of dynamic and deformation of defects in nematics.  In  addition, an
              investigation defects in biaxial liquid crystals  will be initiated.  The
              second part of the project concerns the  evolution of liquid crystals.  It is
              represented by a  nonlinear system which can be viewed as a nonlinear  coupling
              between flow of harmonic maps and a Navier-Stokes  system.  Of particular
              interest is the determination of global  existence, uniqueness and stability of
              classical or weak  solutions.  Work will also be done in studying the partial 
              regularity of such systems by exploring free interface problems  arising in
              elasticity, optimal design and liquid crystal  droplets.       Partial
              differential equations form a basis for  mathematical modeling of the physical
              world.  The role of  mathematical analysis is not so much to create the
              equations as  it is to provide qualitative and quantitative information about 
              the solutions.  This may include answers to questions  about uniqueness,
              smoothness and growth.  In addition, analysis  often develops methods for
              approximation of solutions and  estimates on the accuracy of these
              approximations.   ***
