Abstract    :
              9401315  Yeh    technical abstract:  The effects of controlled defects on the 
              vortex phases and dynamics of high-temperature and conventional 
              superconductors will be investigated by systematically varying the  type and
              density of defects in the superconducting samples.  In  particular, the role of
              zero, one, and two-dimensional defects, as  well as their interplay on the
              vortex phases and the phase  transitions, will be studied by measurements of
              low-frequency (dc-  10 MHz) electrical transport and magnetic properties.  The
              samples  are yttrium barium copper oxide single crystals with controlled 
              densities of point and columnar defects.  In addition, the  microwave vortex
              dynamics associated with the local pinning  properties of superconductors wil
              be compared with the critical  dynamics obtained at lower frequencies.   
              Non-technical abstract:  The presence of defects in superconductors  plays an
              important role in determining their response to external  electromagnetic
              fields and their tolerance to the increase of  temperature.  The main theme of
              this work is to investigate the  effects of controlled defects on the
              properties of high temperature  and conventional superconductors in large
              applied magnetic fields.   Information learned from this investigation can lead
              to  optimizarion of the properties of these superconductors for a  variety of
              applications in large magnetic fields, including  microwave components for
              communication signal detection and  processing, as well as high performance
              superconducting magnets.  ***
