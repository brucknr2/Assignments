Abstract    :
              9401018  Lunts       Professor Lunts will work on problems in the foundations of
               representation theory and algebraic geometry. In particular he  will continue
              his study of the equivariant derived category of  sheaves with a view to
              applications in equivariant geometry and  representation theory.       This is
              research in the field of algebraic geometry.  Algebraic geometry itself is one
              of the oldest parts of modern  mathematics, but one which has had a
              revolutionary flowering in  the past quarter-century. In its origin, it treated
              figures that  could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely 
              polynomials. Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only  from algebra,
              but from analysis and topology, and conversely is  finding application in those
              fields as well as in physics,  theoretical computer science, and robotics.
