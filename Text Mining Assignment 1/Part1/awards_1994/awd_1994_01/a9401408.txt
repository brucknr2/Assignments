Abstract    :
              9401408  Kuperberg(K)        The research involves the study of topological
              dynamics on  3-maifolds. The PI has already made a remarkable contribution to 
              the subject by solving a problem concerned with the existence of  trajectories
              on 3 dimensional manifolds. The current scope of  research entails applying the
              techniques to higher dimensions and  to other cases as described in the project
              description. Results  in this direction would have very significant
              consequences to  dynamical systems, differential topology and mathematical 
              physics.  ***
