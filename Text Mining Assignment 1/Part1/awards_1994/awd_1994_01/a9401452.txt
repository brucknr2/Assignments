Abstract    :
              Gasper  9401452        The award supports mathematical research on fundamental 
              properties of hypergeometric and q-(basic) hypergeometric series,  classical
              and non-classical orthogonal polynomials, and on the  development of new
              methods for proving that certain orthogonal  polynomials and entire functions
              have only real roots.  In  particular, investigations will be made into the
              nonnegativity of  the coefficients in linearization formulas, the positivity of
               kernels in product formulas (both of which lead to new  convolution structures
              and hypergroups), and necessary  and sufficient multiplier conditions (via
              norms involving  fractional differences) for certain systems of orthogonal 
              polynomials.  Continuing work will also be done on sums and  integrals of
              squares of real-valued functions and their  application in deriving explicit
              identities which prove that  certain entire special functions have only real
              roots, and in  deriving new families of inequalities, which also prove that all
               of the rootsare real.       The theory of special functions and orthogonal
              polynomials  has fruitful connections with many branches of mathematical 
              analysis and applied mathematics, such as differential equations,  operator
              theory, numerical analysis, integration, continued  fractions and control
              theory to name a few.  This particular  program makes interesting connections
              with some of the most  outstanding mathematical questions considered in the
              mainstream  of interest at this time.  Of particular note is the study of 
              roots of entire functions which relates directly to the Riemann  hypthesis.
