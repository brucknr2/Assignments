              ABSTRACT    The central focus of this research will be the development of
              displacement chromatography for the separation of gases with pressure, vacuum
              or thermal swings to regenerate the column.  Operation modes will be tested
              that utilize the least adsorbing species in a multicomponent mixture as the
              carrier gas and the strongest adsorber as the displacement fluid.  Several
              systems will be examined including separation of light hydrocarbons and
              hydrogen as well as carbon dioxide and methane with either hydrogen or
              nitrogen.  Theoretical descriptions of the process will include modification of
              local equilibrium models and development of realistic rate models.   
              Separation of gases is important for a number of industries.  Current methods
              can be difficult and expensive to perform in practice.  New processes like
              those to be studied in this project may help to production costs.
