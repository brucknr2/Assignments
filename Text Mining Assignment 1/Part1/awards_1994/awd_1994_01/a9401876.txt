Abstract    :
                This award provides continued partial support for the collection  of protozoa
              and algae housed at the American Type Culture  Collections.  The collection
              maintains mostly free living and  some parasitic protozoa and those algae that
              can be  cryopreserved.  The Collection distributes the organisms as well  as
              information associated with them to the world research  community.    The goals
              of the Collection during this funding period include:  (1) maintain the high
              level of quality control of the Collection,  (2) where necessary, apply
              state-of-the-art methodologies to  improve the authentication of certain
              strains; (3) apply improved  preservation methodologies to lower costs and
              facilitate  distribution, (4) diversify the holdings to include members of 
              major groups of fee-living protozoa not currently held and expand  holdings of
              groups that are poorly represented, (5) organize the  strain information into
              computer databases that are accessible to  the user community, and (6) to
              optimize quality control of its  holdings.
