Abstract    :
              OCE-9401717    The geological structure of the oceanic crust is typically
              inferred  from marine geophysical studies.  Multichannel seismic techniques 
              have been used with great success to study the crustal structure at  fast
              spreading centers where the seafloor is relatively flat and in  locations where
              the seafloor is covered by thick sediments.  The  rough seafloor topography and
              large seismic velocity gradients  typically found at slow spreading centers
              such as the Mid-Atlantic  Ridge have limited the success of studies to
              determine crustal  structure in these regions.  Seismic processing techniques
              have  been developed, at least in theory, to address these problems.  If  the
              processing techniques described in the proposal are successful,  it should be
              possible to address a host of fundamental geological  problems at slow and
              intermediate spreading ridges.
