Abstract    :
              9401933  Getzinger  This award will fund an effort to increase cooperation
              between the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and the
              Far Eastern Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences.  They will work together
              to organize a major international scientific conference.  The meeting, "Bridges
              of Science Between North America and the Russian Far East:  Past, Present, and
              Future," will be held August 29 - September 2, 1994, in Vladivostok.  One
              Hundred North Americans and 150 Russians are expected to attend.    Scientists
              working in Alaska and the Russian Far East share an intense concern for the
              protection and preservation of the cultural and natural history in the region
              called Beringia.  Beringia contains unique, delicately balanced ecosystems that
              stand to receive the most severe and immediate impact of greenhouse warming
              and, consequently, will have far-reaching efforts on the lives of the
              indigenous peoples and other inhabitants of the region.  The conference will
              address these timely issues, focusing on the four themes; Natural Resources and
              Environmental Changes; Paleoecology of Beringia:  New Developments; Development
              and Adaptation of People and Cultures; and Communication and Information
              Exchange.    As a result of the conference, a proceedings volume and a
              directory of Russian and American institutions and scientists in the region
              will be published in both English and Russian, and widely disseminated. The
              conference will strengthen scientist-to-scientist cooperation already underway
              between the Russian Far East and North America, and present opportunities to
              expand collaborative efforts.  The Vladivostok location will allow for broad
              participation by Russian scientists and provide North American researchers with
              enhanced opportunities to explore the potential for cooperative research as
              Russian laboratories, ships, and field stations are now available to Western
              scientists.  ***
