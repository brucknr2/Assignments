Abstract    :
              9401115  Karabel         This is an award under the Grants for Improving
              Doctoral  Dissertation Research Program. It is a study of policy experts, 
              political intellectuals, and political change in the United  States, 1935-1950,
              assessing the roles that experts and  intellectuals played in mediating
              different policy outcomes.   This will be accomplished through four case
              studies: 1) Social  Security, 2) labor law reform, 3) national health policy,
              and 4)  employment policy.  Analysis will compare the context of policy 
              debates and political culture in each of these domains, assessing  the extent
              to which expert reformers and their allies among  political intellectuals
              dominated debates in policy arenas.  %%%       This research will contribute to
              political sociology,  evaluating the relative success of theories based on
              state-  centered institutional approaches compared with those based on 
              class-centered approaches.  In addition to the scientific gains  to be achieved
              by the research, this award will materially assist  a highly promising student
              in completing research for the Ph.D.  dissertation.  Thus it contributes to the
              future scientific  manpower of the nation and the thorough training of the next
               generation of social scientists.    ***
