Abstract    :
              94013162  Blackadar       The investigator proposes to continue work on a range
              of  problems concerning the structure of operator algebras and  noncommutative
              algebraic topology. Specific topics to be studied  are:  structure of inductive
              limits of C*-algebras, structure of  groupoids and their C*-algebras, nonstable
              K-theory and the  fundamental comparability question, and existence and
              properties  of cohomology theories on C*-algebras.       The proposed work will
              lead toward a description of the  internal structure of a class of algebras
              which arise naturally  throughout mathematics and mathematical physics. It has
              become  very important to understand these algebras, and most of the  necessary
              tools now seem to have been developed, by the proposer  and others, to lead us
              to believe a complete description is  within reach.  ***
