Abstract    :
              Proposal #9401918  Staroselsky    The goal of this work is to develop mature
              computational simulation tools to allow scaling up the designs of laboratory
              size or semi-industrial granular flow system to full scale industrial
              dimensions.  Practical applications range from the design of chutes to hoppers
              to bins and other systems for transporting bulk solids.  The specific goal of
              Phase II is to develop user friendly, general geometry and highly efficient
              computer codes for the simulation of the dynamics of these flows.  This work
              involves combined analytical and numerical of the increasingly dense and
              complex granular material with real-particle effects.  The theoretical work
              will be based on state-of-the-art statistical-mechanical methods, an effort
              which will culminate in the development of reliable macroscopic equations for
              the pertinent macrofields.  The numerical studies will be concerned with the
              development of improved computational and diagnostic means.  Particle dynamics 
              molecular dynamics (MD)  simulations with a few million particles will be
              issued to test the macroscopic equations and to improve the results obtained
              regarding the single-particle and two-particle distribution functions.  The
              results studies will be used to develop both a finite-volume continuum
              mechanical code and a complementary, highly efficient MD code.  The
              finite-volume code for bulk solid transport analysis will facilitate the
              scaling-up of small and medium-scale designs of chutes, hoppers, and bins to
              full-scale industrial applications.
