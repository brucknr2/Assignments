Abstract    :
              This award supports research in commutative algebra.  The  principal
              investigator will study the rigidity question for  finitely generated modules
              over a noetherian local ring.  He will  apply this work to the problem of
              determining when the tensor  product is torsion-free.  He will also work on the
              classification  of local rings of finite Cohen-Macaulay type and will try to 
              determine the ranks of the indecomposable maximal Cohen-Macaulay  modules over
              these rings.  Finally, he will study the  arithmetical properties of Picard
              groups of algebraic varieties  and several related questions concerning the
              multiplicative  structure of fields.   This research is concerned with a number
              of questions in  commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.  Algebraic
              geometry  studies solutions of families of polynomial equations.  One can 
              either study the geometry of the solution set or approach  problems
              algebraically by investigating certain functions on the  solution set that form
              what is called a commutative ring.  This  dual perspective creates a close
              connection between commutative  algebra and algebraic geometry.
