Abstract    :
              9401950  Gordon  In this project, the PIs will analyze, interpret, and publish
              an  extensive data set from the BEST (BEnguela Current Sources and  Transport)
              Experiment.  Data from a moored array of current meters  and Inverted Echo
              Sounders (some with pressure sensors), and a CTD 
              (Conductivity-Temperature-Depth) survey will be used to study the  transport of
              Indian Ocean water into the Atlantic, and its mixing  processes, particularly
              the formation and transport of eddies.  ***
