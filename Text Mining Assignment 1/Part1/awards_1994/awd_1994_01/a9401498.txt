Abstract    :
              9401498  Wilson       This award supports mathematical research focusing on the 
              development of integral inequalities which give precise  information on how the
              interior smoothness of solutions of  elliptic partial differential equations is
              controlled by the size  of their boundary functions.  Specifically, the project
              concerns  efforts to find necessary and sufficient conditions on pairs of 
              weights so that inequalities between derivatives of solutions of  partial
              differential equations and their boundary values hold.   That is, between the
              integral of various powers of these  functions.  These are usually referred to
              as two-norm  inequalities and are useful for several reasons.  One is that 
              they give information on how approximate solutions can be  expected to converge
              to the correct one.  In this work, the  underlying domains will have relatively
              course boundaries,  forcing the geometry of the domain to play a fundamental
              role in  the analysis.  Expansion of these inequalities to what are called 
              biharmonic operators is also expected.        Integral inequalities have
              traditionally played a central  role in the study of differential equations. 
              They give  criticalinformation about average values of solutions and 
              derivatives, often providing existence results where no concrete  form (except
              for numerical estimates) is possible.  ***
