Abstract    :
              SBIR Phase II Proposal ISI-9401615  PI:  Craig Richardson  Atlanta Signal
              Processors, Inc.  "A Variable Rate Real-Time Speech and Video Coder  for Video
              Teleconferencing from 19.2 to 64 Kbps"      This project is funded under the
              National Science Foundation's  (NSF) Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
              program, which is  designed to provide an opportunity for small business,
              particularly  the small high technology firm, to participate in NSF research.  
              Phase I of the SBIR program serves as a filter to select promising  proposals
              and determine if the firm can do high quality research.   Phase II is the
              principal research project.  Phase III is the  conversion of the NSF-funded
              research into commercial applications  and technological innovation supported
              by follow-on private  venture capital or other non-federal financing.    This
              Phase II project involves design and development of a  real-time video and
              speech encoder/decoder system that combines a  high quality, low bit-rate full
              color video coder with a high  quality, low bit-rate, variable rate speech
              coder.  The target  bit-rates for the combined video and speech range from 19.2
              kbps to  64 kbps for frames of size 176 x 144 and 352 x 288 at 15 and 30 
              frames per second.  The real-time hardware environment is based on  a
              multi-processor configuration of digital signal processors.
