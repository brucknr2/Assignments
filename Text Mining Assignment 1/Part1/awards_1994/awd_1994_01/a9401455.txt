Abstract    :
              9401455  Curto      The research of Curto will involve five projects from the 
              subject of multivariable operator theory. These projects are the  following:
              1.A description of the spectral picture of  multiplication on functional
              Hilbert spaces over Reinhardt and  matrix Reinhardt domains. 2.Further
              characterizations of  polynomial hyponormal operators. 3.Using hyponormal
              operator  techniques to characterize initial segments of moment sequences.  4.A
              search for an Sz. Nagy-Foias dilation theory in several  variables.
              5.Understand the relationship between Taylor spectrum  and other spectral
              systems using topological and K-theoretic  invariants.       Hilbert space
              operators are infinite generalizations of  matrices. The infinite
              generalization of a vector is frequently a  function and for this reason
              Hilbert space operators are  frequently modeled as the operator of
              multiplication on a space  of functions. This project involves finding such
              models for  operators or tuples of operators. Once such models are obtained 
              many basic questions about the structure of these operators  become more
              natural.  ***
