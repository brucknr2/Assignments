Abstract    :
              9401256  Green       Professor Green will investigate problems in the geometry
              of  projective varieties and commutative algebra. These include  problems in
              Castelnuovo theory, syzygies of algebraic curves and  generic initial ideals.  
                  This is research in the field of algebraic geometry.  Algebraic geometry is
              one of the oldest parts of modern  mathematics, but one which has had a
              revolutionary flowering in  the past quarter- century. In its origin, it
              treated figures that  could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations,
              namely  polynomials. Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only  from
              algebra, but from analysis and topology, and conversely is  finding application
              in those fields as well as in physics,  theoretical computer science, and
              robotics.
