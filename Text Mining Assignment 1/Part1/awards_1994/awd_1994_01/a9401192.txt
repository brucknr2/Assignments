Abstract    :
              9401192  Moscovici       The proposed research aims to: (1) develop an 
              Alexander-Spanier version of the Chern character; (2) obtain  explicit local
              formulae for the Pontryagin classes of topological  manifolds; (3) develop a
              theory of straight characteristic  classes for foliations of Lipschitz
              manifolds; (4) obtain  residual index formulae for abstract elliptic operators
              in terms  of the Dixmier trace; (5) recover the holomorphic torsion of a 
              Hermitian locally symmetric manifold by means of a geometric zeta  function.   
                 The "quantized" differential and integral calculus, recently  invented by
              Alain Connes, will be applied to the treatment of  certain open problems in
              several areas of mathematics -topology,  geometry and operator algebras.  ***
