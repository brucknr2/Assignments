Abstract    :
              9401537  THUNELL         This investigation will be a component of a
              times-series study  of carbon cycling in the Cariaco Basin, a natural
              depression on the  continental shelf of Venezuela.   Because of restricted
              lateral  water exchange with the open sea to the north, this Basin with its 
              oxygenated surface  waters overlying extensive anoxic waters offers  an ideal
              opportunity to study organic decomposition near a  oxidation-reduction
              boundary.  The contribution of this study to  the overall objectives of the
              Cariaco Basin study will be a  sediment trap project designed to quantify
              seasonal variability in  the organic carbon flux and to estimate degradation
              rates of  organic carbon in the water column.  Seasonal sediment trap data 
              will be used  to refine a model for varve formation in the Basin.    This will
              have important implications for ongoing studies that use  varves to reconstruct
              past climate changes in this region.
