Abstract    :
              9401010  Nur  Funds are provided to develop a quantitative model of the seismic 
              properties of oceanic sediments containing gas hydrates.  It will  help
              delineate the distribution of gas hydrates, estimate their  volume, explain the
              nature of bottom simulating reflectors and  distinguish among hydrate
              morphologies.  The model will also help  in future drilling efforts in hydrate
              fields.  The model will be  based on microstructure of sediments.  The model
              will be tested  in the laboratory by measurements of compressional and shear 
              velocities in cemented granular materials that simulates hydrate  cements.  ***
