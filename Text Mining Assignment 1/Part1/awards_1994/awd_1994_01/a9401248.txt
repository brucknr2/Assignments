Abstract    :
              9401248  Williams       This award supports mathematical research on problems 
              arising in the theory and application of nonlinear  partialdifferential
              equations.  Particular emphasis is placed on  the use of microlocal methods in
              the study of hyperbolic  equations, developing methods for understanding
              diffraction of  singularities by smooth obstacles in several types of nonlinear
               wave problems, resonant reflection and transmission of continuous 
              multidimensional oscillations.  Work will also be done on  nonlinear optics for
              multidimensional shocks.  A major goal of  the project is to introduce the
              consideration of boundaries into  rigorous nonlinear geometrical optics, which
              has until now dealt  mostly with problems in free space.  The importance of 
              boundaries is indicated, for example, by the fact that  multidimensional shock
              front and vortex sheet problems can be  formulated as nonlinear hyperbolic free
              boundary problems.  Also,  boundaries can produce striking effects (such as
              resonant  reflection) even in continuous solutions.       Partial differential
              equations form a basis for mathematical  modeling of the physical world.  The
              role of mathematical  analysis is not so much to create the equations as it is
              to  provide qualitative and quantitative information about  the solutions. 
              This may include answers to questions  about uniqueness, smoothness and growth.
               In addition, analysis  often develops methods for approximation of solutions
              and  estimates on the accuracy of these approximations.  ***
