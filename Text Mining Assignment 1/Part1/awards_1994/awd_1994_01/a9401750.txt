Abstract    :
              9401750  Balsley         The objective of this proposal is to provide Jicamarca 
              Observatory users with the capability for making extended, long-  term
              measurements of the lower atmosphere, the equatorial  electrojet, spread F, and
              the 150 km echo at 13 dB reduced  sensitivity.  The PIs propose to add two new
              receivers, a pair of  low-power (no-cost) transmitters, and an independent
              low-cost  analysis system.  ***
