Abstract    :
              9401852   Lyons                  This project supports continued work on the
              revision of the  proof of the classification of finite simple groups.  The 
              principal investigators propose (1) to begin its publication,  starting with
              the introductory sections giving an outline of the  series and laying the
              general group-theoretic and  K-group-theoretic foundations for the later parts;
              and at the  same time (2) to continue the writing of the later parts, for 
              which drafts of most chapters already exist.                  A group is an
              algebraic structure with a single operation.   It appears in many areas of
              mathematics, as well as physics and  chemistry.  The fundamental building
              blocks of finite groups are  finite simple groups.  One of the major results in
              mathematics of  the past decade is the classification of the finite simple 
              groups, the proof of which would require 10,000 to 15,000 journal  pages.  The
              research supported is a joint effort to produce a  self-contained, simplified
              and coherent treatment of this proof.
