Abstract    :
              9401266        This research is concerned with nxn matrices over  a field.  The
              main focus is on the polynomial identities and  invariants of nxn matrices. 
              There are longstanding open problems  about the ring of generic matrices and
              its center, as well as  combinatorial problems about matrices and their
              identities.  A  secondary focus is on the nxn matrix representations of certain
               infinite groups, particularly the braid groups.      The research  supported
              concerns matrix theory, ring theory and the calculation  of invariants.  In
              particular, this involves an old problem of  determining what mathematical
              functions are preserved under  various transformations.  This is of interest in
              many areas of  science as well as in mathematics. ***
