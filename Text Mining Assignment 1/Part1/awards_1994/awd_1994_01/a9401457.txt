Abstract    :
              9401457  Kaminker       This project will pursue several directions involving
              the  use of operator algebras to obtain invariants for elliptic  operators,
              algebraic K-theory and dynamical systems. a notion of  higher spectral flow
              will be developed. Index theoretic  invariants will be defined which will
              detect elements of  algebraic K-theory of the complex numbers. Operator
              algebras  associated to hyperbolic dynamical systems will be studied and a 
              K-theoretic duality relation will be used to obtain dynamical  information.
              Work will also be done on some questions related to  the Novikov conjecture and
              generalized homology theories on C*-  algebras.       These problems all
              involve Hilbert space operators and their  relation to the geometric properties
              of manifolds, the higher  dimensional analogues of surfaces. Partial
              differential operators  play a large role in this work. These operators occur
              naturally  in the study of applied mathematics and mathematical physics.  ***
