Abstract    :
              9401464  Powers       Powers proposes to study continuous one parameter
              semigroups  of star endomorphisms of operator algebras. Particular emphasis 
              will be given to the simplest case of the full algebra of  operators on Hilbert
              space and binary shifts on hyperfinite  factors of type II_1. Pimsner will
              continue the investigation of  Kasparov's bivariant K-functor in its
              equivariant form,  especially in its applications to the study of C*-algebras
              and  groups and their actions on different kinds of spaces.  Investigations
              will also be made of the related study of  Hilbert bimodules and their
              connection to both KK-theory and to  the theory of subfactors.       Operators
              can be considered as infinite generalizations  of matrices. Given their natural
              addition and multiplication,  a collection of operators can be considered as an
              operator  algebra. A subalgebra of certain types of operator algebras is 
              called a subfactor. The relations between subfactors has  remarkable connection
              with geometry and mathematical physics. The  work of Pimsner will contribute to
              the connections. Powers will  study actions on operator algebras. These actions
              are related  to important questions in the theory of subfactors mentioned 
              above.  ***
