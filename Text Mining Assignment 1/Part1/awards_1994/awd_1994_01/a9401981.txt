Abstract    :
              9401981  Robertson       This award supports the research of Professor G. Neil 
              Robertson to work in combinatorics.  Professor Robertson will  continue his
              work on the graph minors project in an attempt to  provide better information
              on finite graphs.  The work will  include an investigation into questions of
              coloring, surface  embeddings, finite structure, and connectivity of graphs.   
                 The research is in the general area of combinatorics,  in  particular graph
              theory. Combinatorics attempts to find efficient  methods to study how discrete
              collections can be organized.   Graphs are arrangements of points connected by
              lines.  The  behavior of discrete collections like graphs is extremely 
              important in modeling systems and plays a role in modern  computing,
              communications and operations.  For example, the  design of large networks, as
              in telephone systems, and the design  of algorithms in computer science all use
              graphs in their  development, and make use of combinatorial research.
