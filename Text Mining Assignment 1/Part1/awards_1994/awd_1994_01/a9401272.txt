Abstract    :
              9401272  Mason             This award is concerned with the theory of rational 
              orbifolds as part of the broader, and currently very active area,  of vertex
              operator algebras and their representations.  It is  closely associated to
              2-dimensional conformal field theory.  The  principal investigator will examine
              questions of  modular-invariance of partition functions, the construction of 
              twisted sectors, and the general phenomena of higher genus  orbifolds.  Methods
              include ideas from vertex operator algebra  theory, modular forms and group
              theory, all of which play a role  in the so-called Moonshine.           
              Conformal field theory is an important physical theory  describing both
              two-dimensional critical phenomena in condensed  matter physics and classical
              motions of strings in string theory.   Besides its importance in physics, the
              beautiful and rich  mathematical structure of conformal field theory also has 
              interested many mathematicians.  New relations between different  branches of
              mathematics, such as representations of  infinite-dimensional Lie algebras and
              groups, Riemann surfaces  and algebraic curves, the Monster sporadic group,
              modular  functions and modular forms, elliptic genera, and knot theory, is 
              revealed in the study of conformal field theory.
