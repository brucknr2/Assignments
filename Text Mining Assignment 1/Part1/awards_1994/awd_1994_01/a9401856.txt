Abstract    :
              9401856  Du    Silicon oxynitride is an important structural ceramics.  The 
              Principal Investigator wants to study the mechanism that controls  the
              oxidation behavior of silicon oxynitride.  Comprehensive  studies of oxidation
              on pure and dense silicon oxynitride will be  carried out.  To achieve the
              project objectives a time resolved  laser reflectance technique will be used to
              accurately measure the  growth of the oxide layer during oxidation in broad
              range.  Several  other techniques e.g. x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,
              electron  energy loss spectroscopy TEM will be used to perform the chemical 
              and structural characterization of the oxide-substrate interfaces.    %%%   
              Study of the mechanisms that controls the oxidation behavior of one  of the
              important structural ceramics, silicon oxynitride, is  proposed to be carried
              out using the time resolved laser  reflectance method and various x-ray and
              electron microscopic  techniques.  ***
