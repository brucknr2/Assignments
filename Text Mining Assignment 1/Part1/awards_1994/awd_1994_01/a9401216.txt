              Abstract  ATM-9401216  Hartley, Dana  Georgia Tech  Title: Interhemispheric
              Transport: Mechanistic Studies for  Understanding and Improving 3-D Chemical
              Models    The primary goal of the proposal research is to obtain an improved 
              understanding of what mechanisms control the exchange of air  parcels between
              hemispheres: This information will be used to  improve 3-D chemical transport
              models that presently do not  adequately simulate interhemispheric exchange. 
              For some models  this will involve explicitly assessing and improving the model
               dynamics.  However, for transport models that use predetermined  wind fields a
              parameterization of the processes involved will be  necessary.  In order to
              achieve these goals, a combination of  analyses of both observations and
              general circulation model outputs  will be employed to study the dominant
              locations, seasonality, and  interannual variability of cross-equatorial
              transport.  Studies  will also be performed to diagnose the dynamical processes
              related  to the exchanged of mass between hemispheres.    The specific steps to
              meet these goals include analyzing previously  completed simulations of CFCl3
              transport in the Community Climate  Model 2 (CCM2) forced with climatological
              sea surface temperatures  (SSTs) to determine the location and seasonality of
              the transport  between hemispheres.    The PI will also perform runs of the
              CCM2, with CFCl3 as the tracer,  using observed SSTs to examine the influence
              of the El Nino/South  Oscillation (ENSO) on interannual variability of
              interhemispheric  exchange.  After the parameterzation has been tested, it will
              be  available for general use in chemical transport models.
