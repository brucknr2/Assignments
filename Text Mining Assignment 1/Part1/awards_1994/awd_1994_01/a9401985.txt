Abstract    :
              9401985  Gunton  A theoretical and computational investigation of several
              problems  involving spatial pattern formation in nonlinear dynamical systems 
              will be undertaken.  One group of problems involves driven  dissipative
              systems, far from eqilibrium, and includes studies of  Rayleigh-Benard
              convection in simple and binary fluids, as well as  a model of directional
              solidification.  One aspect of this study  deals with the transition from order
              to spatiotemporal chaos.  The  second group of problems involves defect
              formation, surface effects  and shear flow effects.  Although the research
              deals with problems  of fundamental importance to science, several of the
              projects are  also of technological importance.  %%%  ***
