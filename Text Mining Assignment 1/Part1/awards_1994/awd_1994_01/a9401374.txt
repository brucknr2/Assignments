Abstract    :
              Holbrook  9401374    Upcoming Delaware multichannel seismic experiment across
              the  Aleutian Arc will collect high quality vertical incidence seismic 
              refraction data across and active continental and island arc  system.  The PI's
              will piggyback on this cruise to record sound  energy generated by airguns at
              the ocean bottom.  This will provide  deep velocity structure data of both
              continental and oceanic arcs  as well as direct imaging of wide-angle
              reflectivity from the  system boundaries.  The data will help reconcile
              conflicting  hypothesis of deep structure and composition of the arc systems.
