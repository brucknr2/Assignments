Abstract    :
              9401310  Tartar       In the last twenty years, the Principal Investigator has 
              pioneered the creation of most of the new mathematical tools  which are now
              used for studying microstructures appearing in the  (usually nonlinear partial
              differential equations of Continuum  Mechanics or Physics: Homogenization,
              Compensated Compactness,  H-measures. The present Proposal deals with research
              of a  theoretical nature, with the purposes of unifying many  fragmentary
              results and of creating a still more powerful tool.  It links questions of
              Classical Analysis on one side to the  description of microstructures observed
              in existing materials on  the other side, one important application being to
              devise new  materials whose microstructure creates some improved properties 
              over existing materials.  In the last twenty years, the Principal  Investigator
              has pioneered the creation of most of the new  mathematical tools which are now
              used for studying the  microstructures appearing in important situations in
              Material  Sciences and Engineering. This Proposal deals with theoretical 
              questions which can help describing how to devise new materials  whose
              structure at a fine level is responsible for improved  properties over existing
              materials.
