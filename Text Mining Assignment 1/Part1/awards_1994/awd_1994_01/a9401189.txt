Abstract    :
              9401189  Quadagno         This is an award under the Grants for Improving
              Doctoral  Dissertation Research Program.  It is a study of public policy  and
              interest group politics among the elderly in the United  States, the United
              Kingdom and Canada.  The objective of this  project is three fold: 1) to
              examine how the interplay between  welfare state and economic institutions
              empower and constrain  political actors concerned with age-based policy
              formation; 2) to  account for the conditions under which elderly people are
              active  participants in the process of social policy formation; and 3) to 
              explore whether the age-based social policy changes made during  the 1980s
              signal a transition to a different form of welfare  state in which entitlement
              to government benefits shifts back to  need versus age-based criteria.  %%%    
                This research will contribute to social gerontology,  political sociology and
              the sociology of social problems.  Given  the human significance of policies
              concerning government benefits  for the elderly, the results should be of
              interest to policy  makers as well as to social scientists.  In addition to the
               scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this award will  materially
              assist a highly promising student in completing  research for the Ph.D.
              dissertation.  Thus it contributes to the  future scientific manpower of the
              nation and the thorough  training of the next generation of social scientists.
