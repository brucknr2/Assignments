Abstract    :
              9401343  Toole  This project is a contribution to the Indian Ocean Expedition
              (IOE)  of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE).  In it, the PI  will
              participate as a co-principal investigator on two separate  legs of the
              hydrographic survey, along the lines I4-5W-7C, around  Madagascar, I10 between
              Indonesia and Australia, and I-1, from  Indonesia to Somalia.  The PI will then
              participate in the analysis  and synthesis of the data on these and other
              sections collected as  part of the IOE.  Objectives are to describe water
              characteristics,  velocity structure, and transport of the boundary currents
              thought  to exist in the region.  The observations will provide the  foundation
              for the first measurements of the meridional overturning  rate in the Indian
              Ocean.  ***
