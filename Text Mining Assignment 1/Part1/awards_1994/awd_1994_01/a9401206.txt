Abstract    :
              9401206  Bourdon       The project focuses on intertwining maps for holomorphic 
              functions on the open disc. Given a holomorphic map a model can  be constructed
              using the pair consisting of the intertwining map  and the associated map. The
              project considers how change in the  original map affect the intertwining
              component of the model. In  particular, computer investigations will be made of
              the  convergence properties of a sequence of intertwiners for a given 
              holomorphic map. Progress in understanding these  linear-fractional models will
              provide insight into both the  behavior of composition operators and the
              dynamics of holomorphic  self-maps under iteration.       The project involves
              the interplay of operator theory and  function theory. Operator theory is that
              part of mathematics that  studies the infinite generalization of matrices.
              Classical  function theory provides a source of models for operator theory. 
              The current project involves a study of such function theoretic  models. The
              importance of this work is a consequence of  connections with iterative graphic
              computer computations.  Undergraduate student involvement in the project will
              have a long  term benefit for science.   ***
