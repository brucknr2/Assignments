Abstract    :
              9401093  Bergelson       The purposes of this project are to 1) to study types
              of  multiple recurrence for dynamical systems, including various  aspects and
              refinements of the polynomial Szemeredi theorem of  Bergelson and Liebman, by
              combinatorial and structural methods,  2) to examine the existence of bounds
              for various measures of the  stability of averages in ergodic theory, including
              particular  square functions for differences of various processes, through 
              measure-theoretic and Fourier transform techniques, and also 3)  to consider
              problems in entropy, isomorphism, and multiple mixing  for different group
              actions in measure spaces, using both the  methods introduced for studying
              entropy in dynamical systems with  group actions, and the appropriate
              number-theoretic estimates  that apply to such systems.       The purpose of
              this project is to understand better the  long-term behavior of dynamical
              systems from a variety of  viewpoints.  First, by examining the nature of the
              underlying  structure of the dynamical system, types of many-fold repetition 
              of recurrent behavior will be studied. Second, using harmonic  analysis
              methods, the stability and rate of convergence of long  term averages in the
              dynamical system will be considered. Third,  by methods of integration and
              number theory, the nature and  extent of chaotic behavior of dynamical systems
              with many modes  of transformation will be better understood.  ***
