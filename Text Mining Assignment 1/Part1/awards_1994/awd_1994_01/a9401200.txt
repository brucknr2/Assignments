Abstract    :
              9401200  Lawrence    The Department of Communication at the University of Texas
              at El Paso (UTEP) is conducting a two-year research project to identify and
              assess the impact of specific communication variables that may contribute to an
              underrepresentation of Hispanics in computer science (CS) graduate programs and
              academic professions. The project is based on the assumption that various
              external messages, if internalized, can affect the decision-making process of
              undergraduate Hispanic students by either encouraging or discouraging them to
              enter or remain in the discipline. The study combines qualitative and
              quantitative methodologies to ferret out messages that occur at the macro
              (institutional/societal) and the micro (interpersonal) levels. It begins with a
              series of focus groups to obtain a listing of the sources of beliefs,
              attitudes, values, and concerns about computer science and CS professionals
              that exist among Hispanic undergraduates. The list is being used to design,
              pilot-test, and employ a survey instrument for collecting and comparing
              cross-sectional and longitudinal data from stratified random samples of 600
              students. The significance of the project lies in the promise that its findings
              can be used to identify problems that can be ameliorated by advocating the
              construction of effective CS recruiting messages specifically targeted toward
              Hispanics. UTEP is located on the United States-Mexico border, and it is the
              largest Hispanic-majority (60.5%) university in the continental United States.
