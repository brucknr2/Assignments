Abstract    :
              9401426  Schmidt       This award funds the number theory research of Prof. 
              Wolfgang Schmidt.  Prof. Schmidt will work on the solution of  tree congruences
              modulo prime powers.  He will continue his work  on diophantine approximation
              refining Roth's theorem into fields  of positive characteristic.  He is also
              interested in forms of  many variables, in particular a theorem of Birch
              concerning forms  of odd degree.       This is research in the field of number
              theory.  Number  theory is basically the study of whole numbers,  but it
              extends  to the study rational numbers.  Rational numbers are whole number 
              ratios.  We have known for several centuries that not all numbers  can be
              written exactly as whole number ratios,  but from the  moment of this
              discovery,  mathematicians have looked for ways of  coming close.  This part of
              mathematics is called diophantine  approximation,  and it is a critical piece
              of modern mathematics.        ***
