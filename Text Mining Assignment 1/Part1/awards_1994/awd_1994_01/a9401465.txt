Abstract    :
              Chang  9401465       This award continues support for mathematical research on 
              problems involving sharp forms of the classical Sobolev embedding  theorem. 
              The result is stated in terms of fundamental  comparisons called inequalities
              of Moser-Trudinger type.  These  inequalities have been shown to be valuable in
              a number of  problems involving nonlinear partial differential equations, 
              spectral analysis and conformal geometry.  Work will be done on  the ratio of
              determinant of the Laplacian operator of two  conformally related metrics, on
              the extremal metric of  zeta functional determinants on four-manifolds and on
              the  geometric meaning of the constants in the sharp form of the  
              Moser-Trudinger inequalities.       The study of Sobolev embedding is part of a
              broad program  in geometric analysis aimed at understanding various  curvature
              metrics which can exist on surfaces (manifolds) and how  the surfaces can be
              constructed from a given description of  their curvature.  The inequalities
              arise in the study of the  Laplace operator on the surfaces and the resulting
              constants  which occur in the relationship between integrals of solutions  and
              integrals of their gradients.  ***
