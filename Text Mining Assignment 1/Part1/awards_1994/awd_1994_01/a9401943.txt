Abstract    :
              9401943  Bart   The Tulane University Fish Collection, a "National Center"
              category collection with over 6 million fluid-preserved specimens in over
              167,000 lots, is the largest collection of post-larval fishes in North America.
               The type collection contains 33 holotypes, and 127 paratypes (40,252 type
              specimens total).  The collection also contains 1352 skeletons, 2010
              radiographs, and 2428 scale and otolith samples.  The Tulane Fish Collection is
              unique among North American fish collections in having a large average number
              of specimens per lot, high numbers of large specimens form many taxa,
              comprehensive regional coverage, an extraordinarily high quality of
              preservation, and high repetition of material, mostly from long-term surveys of
              major rivers in the Gulf-South region.  The long-term survey samples provide a
              wealth of material for population and community studies, and studies of
              feeding, reproductive biology, and toxicology, in addition to more traditional
              uses in fish systematics.  Funding provides support for personnel, equipment
              and supplies to (1) consolidate material in the main collection to smaller
              containers where appropriate and begin the task of changing preservatives, (2)
              establish a new facility for large specimens and long-term survey material to
              improve their accessibility and conditions of storage, and (3) provide walk-in
              freezer.
