Abstract    :
              9401186 Borcherds             This award supports research on vertex algebras,
              generalized  Kac-Moody algebras, quantum rings, and moonshine. Some 
              generalized Kac-Moody algebras can be constructed using vertex  algebras; in
              particular the monster Lie algebra is such an  algebra and was used to prove
              Conway and Norton's moonshine  conjectures.  There is strong evidence that
              there are many  similar algebras and this will be investigated.  Quantum rings 
              are a generalization of vertex algebras which include the space  of field
              operators of a free field theory as another special  case.  This concept will
              be further explored by the principal  investigator.             Conformal field
              theory is an important physical theory describing  both two-dimensional
              critical phenomena in condensed matter  physics and classical motions of
              strings in string theory.   Besides its importance in physics, the beautiful
              and rich  mathematical structure of conformal field theory also has  interested
              many mathematicians.  New relations between different  branches of mathematics,
              such as representations of  infinite-dimensional Lie algebras and groups,
              Riemann surfaces  and algebraic curves, the Monster sporadic group, modular 
              functions and modular forms, elliptic genera, and knot theory, is  revealed in
              the study of conformal field theory.
