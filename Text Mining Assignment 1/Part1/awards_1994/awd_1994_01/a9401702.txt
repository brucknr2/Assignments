Abstract    :
              Montgomery        This award funds the research in analytic number theory of
              Professor Hugh  Montgomery.  Prof. Montgomery will study a number of
              outstanding problems in  multiplicative and additive number theory including
              the Riemann Hypothesis.  In one  part of the project he hopes to construct a
              general technique for determining optimal  sieve methods.  Such a technique
              would have wide application.         The field of analytic number theory
              applies the techniques of calculus to the  discrete  realm of the whole
              numbers.  Calculus was developed to aid the analysis of  continuous
              mathematical objects.  The idea of using continuous methods to investigate 
              discrete objects is two centuries old, but with the work of the modern analytic
               number  theorists such as Professor Montgomery, the field has had a new
              rebirth.  ***
