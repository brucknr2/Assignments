Abstract    :
                   The visual cortex of the brain is an area where there now is evidence for
              mechanisms of plasticity and learning, even at the earliest stages of
              processing, and even in the adult brain.  It is appropriate to consider new
              approaches to the study of vision in this context.  This meeting brings
              together researchers whose work focuses on the plastic nature and dynamic
              representation of vision.  Presentations and discussions cover physiological,
              anatomical, behavioral and computational perspectives.  Sessions cover the
              topics of cellular and anatomical foundations of learning and memory; adult
              cortical plasticity; perceptual learning; short-term memory and attention in
              active observers; and visual short-term memory.   The conference will have an
              impact on understanding how the visual system interacts with areas
              traditionally associated with memory, and so have an impact across neuroscience
              and psychology, in addition to visual science.
