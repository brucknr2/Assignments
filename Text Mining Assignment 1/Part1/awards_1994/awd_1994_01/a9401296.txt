Abstract    :
               The proposal develops classification based approaches to prediction and
              statistical inference. Examples of statistical problems considered are change
              point problems, histograms, mode identification, reticulate evolution, and
              quantization of probability ditributions. A particular classification problem
              studied is the problem of types, the family of classes that most succinctly
              describes a primitive given family of classes.  One way of predicting the
              future is by recognising circumstances that are similar to circumstances
              already experienced, that is, by placing the present circumstances in some
              established class of circumstances, from which we can infer other aspects of th
              future. Our method of classifying experience will determine how we predict the
              future. Thus we need to study classification to study prediction. We can't
              simply seize on some scheme of classification and use it permanently; we must
              develop new classifications adapting to the success or failure of predictions.
              Thus classification is needed for practical probability judgments, and
              practical probability judgments are needed for classification.
