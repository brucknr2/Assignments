Abstract    :
              9401794  Brown  Ohio State University requests support from NSF for the
              connection  of DeVRY Institute of Technology to the Ohio Academic Resources 
              Network (OARnet) which is the NSF mid-level network that serves the  State of
              Ohio.  A primary goal of OARnet is to facilitate  collaborative projects and
              sharing of resources between  institutions, including those outside the state. 
                OARnet will provide operations management and information services  and it
              will give the school a 56 thousand bit per second connection  to the NSFNET, a
              high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second)  National Backbone network.   
              The school needs greater functionality and network speed to be able  to access
              supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers along  with being able to
              implement a more reliable mail system.  Students  and faculty research will
              benefit from the link.  This is also a  unique opportunity for the schools to
              explore innovative  educational resources.
