Abstract    :
              9401120  Ramkrishna    Description: This project provides travel  support for
              Dr. Ramkrishna, of the Department  of Chemical Engineering at Purdue
              University,  to spend four months at the Jawaharlal Nehru  Center for Advanced
              Scientific Research in  Bangalore, India.  He will collaborate with  professors
              R. Kumar and K.S. Gandhi on research  dealing with the engineering aspects of
              the  development of fine particles of current  technological importance.  These
              include  ceramics, pharmaceuticals, paints and others.   The work involves two
              features.  The first  deals with precipitation in single drops (or  reverse
              micelles), while the second is  concerned with the precipitation in 
              microemulsions.    Scope:  The P.I. has an invitation from the  President of
              the JNCASR in Bangalore to spend  his sabbatical there and to collaborate with 
              its staff.  The collaboration is likely to  enhance the progress of the U.S.
              scientist in  his research, and to produce significant  scientific results. 
              This fits well with the  aims of the Division of International Programs.  ***
