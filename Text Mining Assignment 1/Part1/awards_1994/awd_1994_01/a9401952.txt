Abstract    :
              9401952  Rocca  There is significant interest in the development of compact  and
              efficient sources of coherent and incoherent x-ray  radiation for existing and
              emerging applications.  Our  previous research has studied the generation of
              highly  ionized plasma columns of =200um diameter with electron  temperatures
              of a few hundred eV and good stability  utilizing currents that are 1 to 2
              order of magnitude lower  than those commonly used to create hot plasmas in
              large  pulsed power generators.  Building on these recent results, which
              include the  observation of emission from the 3p-3s laser candidate 
              transitions in neon-like Ca in a 40kA discharge, we propose  to advance on the
              search for soft x-ray amplification in the  plasma of fast capillary
              discharges.  The  proposed research  also includes the study of the conversion
              efficiency of the  electrical stored energy into incoherent x-rays to explore 
              the feasibility of developing an efficient incoherent x-ray  source.  ***
