Abstract    :
                    9401519  Tonry              This project will complete a large survey of
              galaxy distances  measured using Surface Brightness Fluctuations (SBF),
              delineate the  velocity field of galaxies within a distance of roughly 3000
              km/s,  and publish a catalog of these distances and a digital atlas of the 
              galaxy images acquired for this project.         The observations are
              essentially complete for this project,  but reductions of data are expected to
              extend for one year.  Once  the data set is complete, three topics will be
              studied during the  balance of the proposal period.  (1) The Hubble constant
              will be  measured.  (2) The peculiar velocity field within 3000 km/s will be 
              mapped more accurately and less subject to environmental effects  than in
              previous studies.  (3) The map of peculiar velocities will  be used to estimate
              the mass distribution within and near this  volume of space, with emphasis on
              determining the mass and extent  of nearby superclusters and voids without
              assumptions of a relation  between galaxy density and mass density.
