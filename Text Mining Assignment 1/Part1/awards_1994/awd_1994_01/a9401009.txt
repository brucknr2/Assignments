Abstract    :
              9401009  Berkson       The investigations seek to develop a broad  abstract 
              operator theory which expands the role of harmonic analysis in  the structures
              of general analysis.  In this program, the  powerful methods of harmonic
              analysis will be harnessed to  operator theory by expanding the theory and
              scope of transference  methods.  These investigations constitute a fertile
              ongoing  program of fundamental research which has been successfully  applied
              to numerous disciplines in recent years.  The directions  and themes will
              include the following mainstream topics:  multiplier theory and transference of
              maximal estimates for  Fourier multipliers; wavelet decompositions for Fourier 
              multipliers; interpolation methods and transference;  ergodic  theory; abstract
              spectral decompositions.       The planned research will seek a wide unified
              overview of  mathematical applications.  Historically such an approach is 
              crucial to disciplines such as quantum physics, which rely for  their
              explication on broad abstract principles of mathematics.  ***
