Abstract    :
              In the past several years investigation of geometric and  language-theoretic
              aspects of finitely presented groups has  engendered a remarkable interplay
              between group theory, geometry,  and the theory of automata and formal
              languages.  The  introduction of automatic groups and the classification of
              groups  with context free word problem are significant developments in  this
              area.  The contribution of formal languages to this  interplay is that they
              afford new ways of looking at the geometry  of Cayley diagrams of groups.  The
              goal of this proposal is to  develop this approach further by characterizing
              other classes of  groups in terms of the language-theoretic properties.        
                 This project is in the general area of group theory and the  computer-aided
              computational aspects of this field.  There is a  growing interest in using
              computers to answer theoretical  questions in algebra and conversely, algebra
              is quite useful for  the development of algorithms.  This research will not
              only aid  in the development of computer programs in group theory but will 
              influence the development of computer programs in other areas.
