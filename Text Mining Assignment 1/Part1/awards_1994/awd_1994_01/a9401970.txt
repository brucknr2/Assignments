Abstract    :
                    9401970  Krishnaswamy  This project is to supply funding for the
              development of a new  photoelastic type shearing interferometer that is
              considered to be  especially useful in bimaterial systems.  Interfacial cracks
              that  develop in bimaterial systems are inherently of the mixed-mode type 
              which itself is somewhat ambiguous since it involves an arbitrary  length
              scale.  The proposed device is a combination of polariscope  and a shearing
              interferometer which will be used to obtain all  around maps of the crack tip
              fields for a wide range of material  mismatch.  ***
