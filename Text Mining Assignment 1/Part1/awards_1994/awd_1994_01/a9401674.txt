Abstract    :
              9401674 Borg  This award to the Computing Research Association (CRA) provides
              funds to support fifty individuals to attend the Grace Murray Hopper
              Celebration of Women in Computing (GMHC).  The GMHC is a technical conference
              addressing women's successes and achievements in the computing field.  It will
              be held in Washington, D.C. on June 9 11, 1994.  The CRA is an association of
              U.S. and Canadian academic departments of Computer Science and Computer
              Engineering, and Industrial Laboratories engaging in basic computing research. 
              The mission of CRA is to represent and inform the computing research community
              and to support and promote its interests.  Dr. Weingarten is the Executive
              Director of CRA.  Dr. Anita Borg is a consultant engineer in the Network
              Systems Laboratory at Digital Equipment Corporation. ***
