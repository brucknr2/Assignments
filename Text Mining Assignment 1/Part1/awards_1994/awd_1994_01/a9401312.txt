Abstract    :
              Douglas Doren is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational
              Chemistry Program to continue his research in the study of   reactions on
              silicon surfaces.  First principles solutions of the   electronic Schrodinger
              equation are used to determine interatomic   interactions in models for
              reactions on silicon surfaces.  From   calculated interactions in many atomic
              configurations, a global   description of the potential energy is developed
              which is then   subsequently used in classical and quantum calculations of
              reaction rates   and dynamics.  Applications to be studied include desorption
              and   diffusion of hydrogen atoms, abstraction of chemisorbed hydrogen, and  
              adsorption and decomposition of silane.    The immediate objective of Doren's
              research is to develop reliable   methods for calculating mechanisms and rates
              of reactions on silicon   surfaces, and to apply them to several examples which
              are important in   semiconductor device fabrication.  A mechanistic
              understanding of silicon   surface chemistry will be essential for developing
              new semiconductor   technologies that  require unprecedented control over the
              properties of   these materials.
