Abstract    :
              9401895  Weiss  In this project, the PI will carry out measurements of anthropo-
               genic Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC0, F-11 and F-12, along the latitude  20 degrees
              South, the IO WHP section denoted as I-3.  The PI will  also provide CFC
              analytical equipment for use by other measurement  groups for other IO
              sections.  Specific objectives of this work in-  clude studies of propagation
              rates of Antarctic Bottom Water into  the deep Indian Ocean and studies of
              mixing and transport processes  in the thermocline and Antarctic Intermediate
              Water of this region.   Results will be applied to improving models of mixing
              processes and  determining their role in global climate change, and,
              particularly,  on the oceanic modulation of carbon dioxide and other important 
              atmospheric constituents.  ***
