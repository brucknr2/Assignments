Abstract    :
              9401021  Ambler        This award provides support for the establishment of the
              Design  Technologies Laboratory, or DesignLab.  The laboratory will stimulate 
              experimental research in technologies fundamental to building design support 
              tools.  Many such design support technologies are inherently nonprocedural and 
              ill-suited to von Neumann uni-processor architectures.  Efficient
              implementation  strategies demand parallel and distributed computing
              environments with large  shared memories and/or ultra high-speed
              interconnections.  The requested  equipment includes a 16-processor SGI
              Challenge and a very high speed network.          The research topics to be
              explored include intelligent information  databases for multimedia and 3D
              drawings; computer vision, modeling and  visualization; declarative design
              specification languages; collaborative multi-  agent design; meta-languages for
              defining reasoning systems; implementation  strategies for non-procedural
              design technologies; and applied design  technologies.
