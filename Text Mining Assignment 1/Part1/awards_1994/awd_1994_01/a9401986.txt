Abstract    :
                This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              and the  Instrument Development for Biological Research Program of the Division
              of Biological  Instrumentation and Resources will help the Department of
              Chemistry at Columbia University  acquire a 400 MHz Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
              spectrometer for solids investigations, which  will be used in the following
              research projects:  (1) hydrogen bonding and proton diffusion  in hydrogen
              bonded systems; (2) catalysis using enzyme-transition state analog complexes 
              and trapped catalytic intermediates; (3) the photochemistry, dynamics and
              chemical details  of the binding modes in complexes of photoactive organic
              molecules on porous solids such  as zeolites; (4) the molecular mechanism of
              the activatimn of rhodopsin by light; and (5)  characterization of the
              interaction between the glutamate receptor and a highly specific  inhibitor.   
              Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool for the
               elucidation of the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown
              substances,  characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and
              to study the dynamics  of interactions between molecules
