Abstract    :
              9401302  Plaut       The research entails the study of groups which can be 
              isometry groups of Riemannian manifolds and metrics on infinite  dimensional
              groups. As a test case, groups actions on infinite  dimensional spheres can be
              studied. The research has group-  theoretic ramifications and thus may be
              potentially applicable to  algebra and other areas of mathematics.  ***
