Abstract    :
              9401424  Lee       The research is concerned with the modeling and investigation
               of solution techniques for nonlinear-objective combinatorial  optimization
              problems.  Three basic solution techniques are to be  investigated.  These
              techniques are (1) a combination of  linearization and polyhedral methods, (2)
              combination of eigenvalue  bounding methods with polyhedral and Lagrangian
              methods, and (3)  model assessment through geometric methods. Three classes of 
              problems are identified as sources of problems to be used in  testing the
              models and their solution methods.  The application  areas for which the
              algorithms will be tested are network design  problems with inter-link costs,
              fixed charge facility location  problems, and experimental design problems.    
                The outcome of this research are the development of (1) more  general methods
              for tightening integer programming formulations of  difficult discrete planning
              problems with nonlinear objective  function, (2) techniques for integrating
              algebraic bounding methods  for planning problems with nonlinear objective
              functions, and (3)  general principles for the design of branch-and-cut
              procedures for  integer programming based approaches for discrete planning
              problems  with both linear and nonlinear objective function.  Other outcomes 
              of the research will be the development of understanding similar to  those of
              planning problems in network design and experimental  design problems.
