              Univ. requests renewed funding for  shipboard technician activities associated

              a total of 130 days of NSF-funded research primarily in the coastal waters of
              California.  MLML technicians will be responsible for operating and repairing
              instruments while at sea, maintaining instruments ashore and assisting with
              scientific operations as necessary before and after cruises.
