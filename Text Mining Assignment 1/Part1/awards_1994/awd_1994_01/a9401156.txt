Abstract    :
              9401156  Ferrari        This award provides support for the development of
              Titan, a computing  system consisting of an integrated ensemble of computing
              and communication  elements, organized to provide the user with a number of
              services.  These  services will include multimedia capabilities in delivery
              vehicles; storage and  communication; large computing power; large storage
              space; innovative parallel  languages, debuggers, and libraries; and high
              accessibility from both mobile and  fixed locations.  The experimental
              facilities requested include workstations and  servers constituting the
              backbone of the distributed system providing cycles to  the user, ATM switches
              for linking workstations and servers, a video editing  system, a massive
              storage unit, and equipment for linking the network to the  currently available
              CM-5 parallel computer.                The proposed research projects fall into
              three areas:  network and  communications; distributed supercomputer projects
              which are mainly concerned  with providing parallel computing to every user
              through a combined architecture,  operating systems, and programming language
              effort; and multimedia services which  requires integrating systems support,
              software support, and artificial  intelligence tools to create, store, play,
              edit, search, input, and output  multimedia objects.  The networking,
              multimedia, and computing aspects of Titan  form will form the infrastructure
              for a number of computationally intensive  applications.
