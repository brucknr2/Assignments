Abstract    :
              Grassi       Professor Grassi will study elliptic threefolds and Calabi-Yau 
              threefolds. In particular she will study fibrations in Calabi-Yau  threefolds
              with a view to showing their existence independent of  the minimal model
              chosen. She also intends to further study the  recently discovered phenomenon
              of mirror symmetry.       This is research in the field of algebraic geometry,
              yet it  directly connects to two of the great advances in theoretical  physics
              in this century--quantum mechanics and general  relativity. Algebraic geometry
              itself is one of the oldest parts  of modern mathematics, but one which has had
              a revolutionary  flowering in the past quarter-century. In its origin, it
              treated  figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest  equations,
              namely polynomials. Nowadays the field makes use of  methods not only from
              algebra, but from analysis and topology,  and conversely is finding application
              in those fields as well as  in physics, theoretical computer science, and
              robotics.  ***
