Abstract    :
                9401214  Bennett       The project is concerned with the "little L-p"
              sequences   spaces and their applications. Its main objective is to find new 
              ways of making norm estimates for various classes of matrix  transformations
              that are important in Analysis. Emphasis is on  exact results, with best
              constants, and on "elementary  inequalities," those involving matrices and
              sequences having  non-negative entries.        The theory of inequalities is
              crucial to the development of  Modern Analysis. There are applications to
              probability theory,  function theory, precision computations, stability of
              computation  and order of growth. It is through inequalities that one has 
              confidence in estimation and control of solutions to equations.  ***
