Abstract    :
              9401239  Wine       The XXIst Informal Conference on Photochemistry is scheduled
               to be held in Toronto During the period May 15-20, 1994; York  University is
              the official host institution.  The original reason  for the word "Informal" in
              the title is not clear, for this  conference has had a long and illustrious
              history since it was  first held in 1952 at UCLA.  Like Gordon Conferences,
              results  presented at these conferences are not to be referenced in the open 
              literature; this policy encourages discussion of new, controversial  findings
              and perhaps accounts for the word "Informal" in the  conference title.      
              NSF funding will be used solely for the purpose of supporting  student and
              postdoc participation.  A registration, lodging and  travel subsidy of up to
              50% will be provided on a competitive  bases.  Students and postdocs will be
              asked to write a page  describing their research and whether they are coauthors
              or  presenting authors of a paper.  The conference organizing committee  will
              review the requests and will allocate funds based on need, but  with preference
              going to those who present papers.
