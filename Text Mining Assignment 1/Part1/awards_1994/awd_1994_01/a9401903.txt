Abstract    :
              HEDGES  9401903         Processes affecting the preservation of organic matter
              and its  major biochemical components in marine sediments will be studied  with
              a continuing program which will:    a)   Develop a molecular-level technique
              for analysis of tannins       and apply it in a study of the geochemistry of
              these       polyphenols.    b)   Continue our recent studies on the physical
              forms or organic       matter in marine sediments, emphasizing the effects of  
                  protective matrices on major biochemical distributions in      
              organic-rich and deltaic deposits.    c)   Investigate the possible effects of
              slow oxic degradation on       the preservation of organic matter and pollen in
              a marine       turbidite and in continental margin sediments.          The
              proposed tannin initiative is an extension of our efforts  to develop and test
              analytical methods for major biochemicals that  are promising geochemical
              tracers.  The sediment fabric and oxic  degradation studies represent a shift
              in emphasis away from case  studies of biodegradation in specific plant
              tissues, toward field  investigations of processes that may strongly affect the
               preservation of sedimentary organic materials on a global scale.
