Abstract    :
              9401842  Khuller    Over recent years, the Capital Area Theory Seminar has been 
              particularly  active, hosting a talk every other week.  Some of  the speakers
              for the seminar  are local, and others are visitors  to the DC area.  The
              mailing list has 107  entries, some of which  are other mailing lists.  The
              goal of the seminar is to  stimulate  activity in theoretical computer science.
               In this regard, the  seminar has been quite successful.  The seminar is often 
              attended by  researchers from Univ. of Maryland at Baltimore  County, Johns
              Hopkins Univ.  and Georgetown University.  ***
