Abstract    :
              Proposal No. 94-01209    This award provides funding for an improved seismic
              quality control and display system aboard the R/V EWING, a 208 foot vessel that
              is owned and operated by LDEO in support of oceanographic research.  NSF is the
              primary user of the EWING, and in 1994 the ship will support over 200 days of
              NSF-funded research.  Much of this research will require use of the EWING's
              seismic system.    The EWING's seismic system consists of up to 20 airguns and
              a hydrophone array of up to 240 channels. At this time all data acquired by the
              system is written directly to magnetic tape.  Scientists must wait until the
              magnetic tape is full and the system has switched to a new tape before any data
              analysis may be attempted.  This process can take anywhere from 22 minutes to 8
              hours depending on the number of channels being recorded. Real-time access to
              the data stream is not available, and therefore, no quality control or
              preliminary data processing is possible.    The PIs will place a SCSI splitter
              between the data stream and the tape drives to pass a copy of the data to a
              workstation in realtime.  This data set could be used for realtime quality
              control and preliminary processing.  The PIs will also develop routine quality
              control algorithms, implement low-fold stacking algorithms and data displays to
              aid in preliminary data processing, provide standard SEG-Y disks files via the
              shipboard computer network for scientists who prefer to use their own seismic
              processing software, and provide documentation for the software.
