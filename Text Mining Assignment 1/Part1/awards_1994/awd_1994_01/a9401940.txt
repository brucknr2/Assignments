Abstract    :
              9401940  Johansen    This three-year award supports U.S.-Scandinavia-Baltic 
              cooperation in regional sciences and economics.  The principal  investigators
              are:  Harley Johansen of the University of Idaho;  Folke Snickars of Sweden's
              Royal Institute of Technology; and  Inna Shteinbuka of the Latvian Ministry of
              Finance.  The  investigators propose to explore business development by 
              Scandinavian firms in the Baltic States and Russian Federation.   They will
              investigate patterns associated with the movement of  western firms into the
              region and with regional development and  processes. The project will start
              with a case study of a Finnish  oil company and their Baltic strategy for
              locating petrol  stations.  This will be followed by studies on Swedish and 
              Norwegian firms.      The project takes advantage of Scandinavian experience
              and  longstanding ties to the region and access to data and  information.  The
              Swedish investigator heads an important program  in regional sciences and
              economics and brings to this  collaboration his expertise and ties to the
              Latvian Ministry of  Finance and University of Latvia.  Investment in private 
              enterprise, especially in the form of joint ventures between  western companies
              and local partners, is a priority for Latvia  and the other Baltic States and
              Russian Federation. The project  will form a foundation for understanding the
              process and  geographic patterns associated with movement of western firms.  
              Its results will be useful to Baltic economists; to development  of market
              companies in the region; and to western companies who  have an interest in
              investing in the former Soviet Union.  ***
