Abstract    :
              9401751  Gruissem  Organellar genetic systems are found in all eukaryotic cells.
               Investigations into their functions and regulatory processes are critical to
              the understanding of eukaryotic cell biology.  Increasing evidence points to
              mitochondria in animals, and to mitochondria or chloroplasts in plants, as the
              underlying cause for clinical myopathies and plant diseases.  In addition
              several important processes that affect RNA processing and protein function
              have emerged from the study of animal, yeast, and plant mitochondria, as well
              as plant chloroplasts.  %%%  The May, 1994 Gordon Research Conference on
              Mitochondria and Chloroplasts in Volterra, Italy, will bring together an
              international group of geneticists, molecular biologists, biochemists, and cell
              biologists to exchange ideas and information on  a wide range of problems in
              these organelles.  It will be the first time that this meeting is held outside
              the U.S.  This biannual gathering has become a principal meeting ground for
              those interested  in organelle biogenesis and function.  It is the only meeting
              with the express purpose of integrating knowledge from the chloroplast and
              mitochondrial fields. Significant new developments have occurred in the field
              since the last meeting in 1992.  ***
