Abstract    :
              9401669  Farach  This Americas Program award will support participation  of 6
              U.S. lecturers and 8 researchers from Latin  America, Africa and Asia in the
              International College  on Biophysics to be held in the International Center 
              for Theoretical Physics. Trieste, Italy in September  1994.  The meeting will
              focus on experimental and  theoretical aspects of biomolecules: structure, 
              dynamics and solvent effects.  The U.S. organizer for  this meeting is Dr.
              Horacio Farach of the University  of South Carolina, Columbia.    The
              International Center was established to promote  research by scientists from
              developing countries as an  effort to contribute to the growth and development
              of  Third World technology.  It supports research  activities in high energy
              and solid state physics,   provides a range of advanced courses and
              conferences,  and offers a full program of visits in all branches of  physics,
              biophysics, biotechnology and applied  mathematics.  The proposed meeting will
              give  researchers from developing countries an opportunity  to be in direct
              contact with leaders in the field and  obtain a systematic, up-to-date
              knowledge of the  present status of their own and related research  fields. 
              Lecturers, in turn, will obtain a first-hand  view of development problems in
              third world countries,  particularly with regard to academic research, and 
              will gain an international view of the field of  biophysics and a broadened
              perspective of its  applications.    ***
