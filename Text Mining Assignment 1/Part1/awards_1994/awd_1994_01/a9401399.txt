Abstract    :
              9401399 Thompson             This award supports research on finite groups,
              discrete groups  and Galois groups.  The principal investigator will determine
              if  the trace spectrum of a uniformizing group of a 4-punctured  sphere is
              determined by the punctures.  Given a natural number n,  he will see if
              SL(2,2^n) is the Galois group of a regular  extension of Q(T), where Q denotes
              the rationals, such that at  most 4 points of the T-line ramify.  He will also
              consider for a  given number field K if there is a finite set S(K) of finite 
              simple groups with the property that every finite group G, all of  whose
              irrecudible characters have values in K, has all its  composition factors
              alternating groups or in S(K).             A group is an algebraic structure
              with a single operation.  It  appears in many areas of mathematics, as well as
              physics and  chemistry.  One of the major problems in algebra is concerned 
              with identifying those groups which can be represented as a  Galois group over
              the rationals.  This involves a blend of  algebra, number theory and algebraic
              geometry.
