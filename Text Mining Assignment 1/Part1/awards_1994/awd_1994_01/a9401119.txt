Abstract    :
              9401119  Overton  This proposal addresses the goal of NSF's Research Opportunity
               Award program: to enable researchers at institutions with limited  research
              opportunities to work with NSF-funded investigators at  better known
              institutions.  This project will bring a colleague  on the faculty of Fordham
              University (Bronx, NY) to New York  University to develop a collaborative
              working relationship with  the principal investigator.  The work concerns a
              nonsmooth  quasiconvex optimization problem.  The minimization objective is 
              linear, but the constraints are Hermitian matrix inequalities,  either linear
              or nonlinear.  An equivalent formulation is the  minimization of the largest
              eigenvalue of a Hermitian definite  matrix pencil, which is a pair of matrices
              (A, B) with B positive  definite.  This specific problem is of great importance
              in modern  methods for robust control.  The goal is the development of fast, 
              reliable numerical algorithms to solve this problem, together  with analysis of
              theoretical questions concerning optimality  conditions and algorithm
              convergence.  Software will be developed  and made available to the general
              scientific community over the  Internet (using Netlib).  Applications in robust
              control will be  emphasized.  ***
