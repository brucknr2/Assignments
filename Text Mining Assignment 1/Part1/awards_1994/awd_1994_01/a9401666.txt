Abstract    :
              9401666  Tang    This award is under the International Junior Investigator and 
              Postdoctoral Fellows Program, which enables U.S. scientists and  engineers to
              conduct three to twelve months of research abroad at  research centers of
              proven excellence.  The program's awards  provide opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of unique  or complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a three months
              postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Jinke Tang of the University of New Orleans
              to work  with Dr. Qiang Su of Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry in 
              Changchun, Jilin, PRC.      This project involves the study of the
              magnetoresistance and  related properties of a nanocomposite material
              consisting of  magnetic particles of oxide, y-Fe2O3, dispersed in copper
              matrix.  Also they will investigate the magnetotransport properties of a 
              nanocomposite in which magnetic nanoparticles of rare earth  metals  are
              dispersed in copper matrix.  ***
