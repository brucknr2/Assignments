Abstract    :
              9401124  Campbell        This award provides support for an experimental,
              high-speed network  infrastructure that would interconnect parallel systems,
              large-capacity secondary  and tertiary storage devices, and muli-media
              workstations capable of supporting  high-quality digital audio and video.  The
              network architecture is based on a  broadband ISDN backbone of Asynchronous
              Transfer Mode (ATM) switches and fiber  optics links.  A high-bandwidth,
              gigabit/second HIPPI network would interconnect  an Intel Paragon distributed
              memory parallel system and a tertiary storage  system.                The
              research spans three basic areas:  system software infrastructure for  managing
              high-speed networks, data pre-fetching and staging policies for high-  latency,
              high-capacity secondary and tertiary data stores, and information access  and
              multimedia collaboration software.
