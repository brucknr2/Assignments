Abstract    :
              This project, in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry
              Program, is  concerned with the use of electron donor ligands that undergo
              irreversible fragmentation after  photochemically induced electron transfer to
              probe the dynamics of excited state transition metal  systems.  In principle,
              the use of an irreversible chemical reaction that occurs after the electron 
              transfer will allow for the determination of excited state dynamics that cannot
              be obtain by direct  time resolved spectroscopic methods.  The method will be
              applied to molecular and ion paired  systems using nanosecond/picosecond
              transient absorption spectroscopy and quantum yield  measurements.   
              Absorption of electromagnetic radiation occurs with the formation of an excited
              state of  absorbing molecule.  What happens to this absorbed energy very much
              depends upon the lifetime  of the excited state.  This project is designed to
              acquire fundamental information about the  behavior of excited states in a
              variety of transition metal compounds.  Ultimately the information  obtained
              from these studies may prove useful in developing better chemical methods of
              solar  energy conversion.
