Abstract    :
              This award supports the participation of scientists and  undergraduate students
              at Rhodes College in the development of an  advanced solar coronal observing
              system.  The goals of the program  are twofold: (a) to develop a set of
              observing systems that will  permit the most thorough and incisive experimental
              investigation to  date of the solar corona and chromospheric linkages, and
              through  this development, (b) to provide for the education of undergraduate 
              students in both the experimental techniques and observational  applications of
              state-of-the-art imaging systems.  The advanced  coronal observing system will
              be designed and built at the National  Center for Atmospheric Research and
              Rhode's College and will be  deployed at NCAR's solar observing site on Mauna
              Loa in Hawaii.
