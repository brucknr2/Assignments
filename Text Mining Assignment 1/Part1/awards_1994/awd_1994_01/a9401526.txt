Abstract    :
              Professor Crew will study overconvergent isocrystals on algebraic  varities of
              characteristic p. He hopes to characterize those  isocrystals with finite
              dimensional cohomology or at least obtain  a reasonable criterion for
              finite-dimensionality for them.    This project falls into the general area of
              arithmetic geometry -  a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of
              mathematics:  number theory and geometry.  This combination has proved 
              extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems that  withstood
              generations.  Among its many consequences are new error  correcting codes. 
              Such codes are essential for both modern  computers (hard disks) and compact
              disks.
