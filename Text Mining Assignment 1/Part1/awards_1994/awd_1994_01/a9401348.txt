Abstract    :
              9401348  Watson    Dr. Watson will continue his theoretical research on the
              creation and  transport of maser radiation in diffuse astrophysical
              environments.  The  results will be applied to interpreting the observations of
              star-forming  regions, of circumstellar environments, and of the diffuse medium
              in other  galaxies.  Delineating the characteristics of maser radiation from
              gaseous,  Keplerian disks, and other geometrical configurations will be a
              central topic.   Calculations for the polarization properties needed to infer
              the relationship  between the magnetic field and the gas at the highest
              densities will also be  performed.  Astronomical phenomena that involve the
              dense molecular gas,  such as star formation, will be better understood as a
              result of this research.
