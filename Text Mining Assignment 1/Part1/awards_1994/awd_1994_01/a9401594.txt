Abstract    :
              9401594  Palmer       Holonomic fields are quantum field theories with an
              intimate  connection to elliptic operators with isolated singularities. The 
              correlation function or tau-function of such fields have appeared  in a wide
              variety of contexts including, the scaling limit of the  two dimensional Ising
              model, the Riemann-Hilbert problem on the  complex sphere, level spacing
              distributions for random matrices,  the KdV hierarchy and its relatives, the
              asymptotics of Toeplitz  determinants, and recently intersection theory on the
              moduli  space of Riemann surfaces. A reformulation of the original  Sato, Miwa
              and Jimbo theory that has been worked out by  Professor Palmer makes it
              possible to consider a variety  of generalizations. The proposal here is to
              complete the analysis  of the Dirac operators on the hyperbolic disk and to
              make the  field theory connection by developing an analytic version of the 
              theory of vertex operators. These vertex operators should also  prove useful in
              simplifying (and generalizing) some of the  algebraic analysis that goes into
              the theory of vertex operator  algebras. Quantum field theories are
              mathematical models for  quantum mechanics. In addition the use in mathematical
              physics in  these theories often represent the beginning of new developments 
              in mathematics. The proposal here involves explicit description  of invariants
              of earlier quantum field theories. These  descriptions lead to surprising
              connections with important recent  mathematical developments in algebra and
              geometry.  ***
