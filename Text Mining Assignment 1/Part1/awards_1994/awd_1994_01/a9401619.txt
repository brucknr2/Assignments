Abstract    :
                Orientation and migration are behaviors that exploit a variety of sensory cues
              from the environment, many of which still are very poorly understood.  The
              discovery that the electroreceptive systems of sharks may allow the swimming
              fish to detect aspects of magnetic fields has opened a controversial area for
              geomagnetic behavior.  There are field data that suggest hammerhead sharks may
              use local geomagnetic variation of the seafloor for cues in homing behavior
              after extensive foraging trips. This project uses a laboratory setting to train
              juvenile sharks to orient to an artificial magnetic ridge that can be changed
              in its topography.  A related field study will test whether sharks relocated
              during their return homing trips will follow a predicted path given the local
              magnetic environment.  These results will have an impact in the controversy
              about geomagnetic behavior, and be important for sensory neuroscience.  It also
              may have practical application in the location and capture of important
              commercial species of fish.
