Abstract    :
              9401326  Shoureshi    Electric power source has a major impact on the overall
              electric  power distribution on a national level.  The optimal process of 
              energy generation, transmission, distribution, and utilization  directly
              impacts economics of every industry.  An  Industry/University Cooperative
              Research Center for Advanced  Control of Energy and Power Systems at Purdue
              University could  provide a better mechanism to stimulate industrial innovation
              in  the development of new technologies in the advanced control system  or
              methods for energy and power systems.    A number of companies have committed
              to support this effort.   Currently there are seven sponsors for the Center
              committing  approximately $400,000.    The Principal Investigators are
              internationally recognized  scientists who have the resources and capability to
              run this  Center.    The Program Manager recommends Purdue University be
              awarded $50,000  for the first year of a five-year continuing award.    Near
              the end of each 12-month period, the Program Manager and/or  the Division
              Director of the Engineering Education Centers Division  will review the
              progress of the Center on a number of renewal  criteria requirements, including
              the following:   1) the extent to  which the university/industry interaction is
              developing; 2) the  extent to which the support base is developing; and 3) the
              extent  to which a robust research program is developing.  If the review is 
              satisfactory, the Program Manager will recommend support for the  next period
              of this continuing award.
