Abstract    :
              Sczech            This award funds the research of Professor Robert  Sczech in
              analytic number theory.  Prof. Sczech plans to  explicitly construct certain
              Eisenstein cocycles in the  Eilenberg-MacLane cohomology of the general linear
              group of  dimension n over the integers.  The ultimate aim of these 
              constructions is to study the special values of particular  L-functions in
              number theory.            This is research in the field of analytic number 
              theory.  Number theory is the study of properties of the whole  numbers.  In
              analytic number theory  properties of whole numbers  are examined by encoding
              numbers into the functions of calculus.  Number theory is among the oldest
              fields of mathematics, yet it  has always played an important role in choosing
              directions for  the rest of the subject.  Within the last half century, the
              study  of whole numbers has become doubly important as the theory has  been
              used to develop new algorithms for computer science and to  construct new error
              correcting codes for electronics. ***
