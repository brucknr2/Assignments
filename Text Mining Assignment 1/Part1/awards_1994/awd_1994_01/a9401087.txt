Abstract    :
              9401087  Narendran  This award supports Paliath Narendran, Deepak Kapur and two 
              graduate students of the University of Albany, to interact with  Professors
              Freidrich Otto of the University of Kassel and Klaus  Madlener and Jurgen
              Avenhaus of the Computer Science Department  of the University of
              Kaiserslautern.  All of them are widely  recognized for their outstanding
              contributions to various areas  among their mutual interests, which include
              symbolic  computation, theorem proving, unification and algebraic issues 
              related to term rewriting.  The U.S. participants are  particularly strong in
              automated deduction and symbolic  computation, and they have been active in
              both theoretical and  practical aspects of these fields.  Their interests and 
              expertise are well matched and complemented by their highly  regarded German
              colleagues.     This work has direct relevance to theorem proving and 
              constraint solving, which are emerging as crucial technologies  in future
              programming systems.  Therefore the results of this  collaboration among these
              innovative mathematicians and  computer scientists are very likely to be
              theoretical advances  that will have practical value in designing and using 
              programming languages and symbolic computation systems.  The  involvement of
              the two graduate students will be a valuable  experience at an early stage in
              their research careers.  ***
