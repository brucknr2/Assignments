Abstract    :
              A series of deep fine and microstructure profiles will be conducted across the
              Romanche and Chain fracture zones of the equatorial Atlantic mid-ocean ridge.
              The focus of the research is on the flow of bottom waters over major sills
              where enhanced mixing associated with hydraulic jumps is expected. Several
              sites located on the equator and at 1 and 2 degrees latitude, but outside the
              fracture zone will also be sampled  to contrast the conditions within the
              fracture zone and document the velocity and mixing fields of the deep cross
              equatorial jets. This exploratory work is collaborative with one of the French
              contribution to the deep basin experiment.
