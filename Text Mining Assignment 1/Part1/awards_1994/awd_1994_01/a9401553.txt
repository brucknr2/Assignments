Abstract    :
              9401553  Stevens         This award funds the research of Prof. Glenn Stevens
              into  connections between Number Theory and Algebraic Geometry.  In  particular
              Prof. Stevens will study the arithmetic properties of  modular symbols.  He
              also hopes to make progress in the  understanding of the exceptional zero
              conjecture of Mazur, Tate  and Teitelbaum from higher rank and from higher
              weight.         This is research in the field of number theory.  Number  theory
              is basically the study of whole numbers.  The research  done under this award
              studies properties of the whole numbers by  encoding them into functions called
              modular forms. Number theory  is among the oldest fields of mathematics,  yet
              it has always  played an important role in choosing directions for the rest of 
              the subject.  Within the last half century, the study of whole  numbers has
              become doubly important as the theory has been used  to develop new algorithms
              for computer science and to construct  new error correcting codes for
              electronics.
