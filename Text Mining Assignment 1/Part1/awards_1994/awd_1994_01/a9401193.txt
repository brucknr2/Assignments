Abstract    :
              9401193  STANTON       Stanton will continue his work on holomorphic torsion, 
              extending it to the doubly-laced case.  He will attempt to show  that the
              formal geometric zeta function has a meromorphic  extension to the complex
              plane.  He will examine a number of  other cases of locally symmetric or
              locally homogeneous  geometries to test a conjectured technique for
              constructing  geometric zeta functions using compactifications of the simply 
              connected covering space.       The general area of the research is analysis on
              symmetric  spaces.  One is interested in finding analogues of the classical 
              special functions defined on geometric spaces that are  generalizations of
              classical domains in n-dimensional complex  space.  ***
