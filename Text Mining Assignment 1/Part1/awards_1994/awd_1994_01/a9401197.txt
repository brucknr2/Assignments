Abstract    :
              9401197  Regev       This award funds the research of Prof. Amitai Regev in 
              algebraic combinatorics.  Prof. Regev will study the asympotics  of character
              sequences,  PI algebras and Kronecker products.   This work has implication for
              combinatorics, representation  theory and algebra.       This research falls in
              the broad category of combinatorics,  which is one of the most active fields in
              today's mathematics. At  its roots, combinatorics is the study of systematic
              counting.   Counting can be incredibly difficult when the objects are 
              difficult to list,  and combinatorists look for general methods  for overcoming
              these difficulties.  Today's combinatorics makes  use of a wide variety of the
              most advanced and modern  mathematical techniques.  Although its roots go back
              several  centuries, the field has had an explosive development in the past  few
              decades.  This growth comes from its importance in  communications and
              information technology and from the success of  modern techniques to problems
              of counting.
