Abstract    :
              Gouvea            This award funds the investigations of Prof. Fernando  Gouvea
              under the Research in Undergraduate Institutions Program.   Prof. Gouvea will
              study the arithmetic of modular forms and the  arithmetic of diagonal
              hypersurfaces over finite fields.  The  central topic in the first part of the
              work is the study of two  operators introduced by Atkin.  In the second part
              the  investigator will study the simplest cases of arithmetic on  abelian
              varieties.            This research falls under the general heading of Number 
              Theory. Number Theory is the study of the properties of the whole  numbers and
              is the oldest branch of mathematics. From the  beginning problems in number
              theory have furnished the driving  force to creation of new mathematics in
              almost all parts of the  discipline. One of the philosophies of modern number
              theory is  that many facts about numbers can be studied using calculus and 
              geometry.  This approach is very evident in the work of this  project since
              modular forms are studied using calculus and  abelian varieties are studied
              using geometry.  This kind of  number theory is very technical and deep, but it
              has had  astonishing applications in areas like theoretical computer  science
              and coding theory. ***
