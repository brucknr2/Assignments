Abstract    :
              Hales       This award supports the work of Professor Thomas Hales in the
              Langland's  Program.  The Langland's Program is central to modern number theory
              by providing  structure to the idea that discrete geometric information can be
              studied analytically.  Prof. Hales works on establishing special cases of the
              trace formula.  He is also  interested in studying some unsolved problems in
              real groups.  These problems are of  interest in a number of different areas of
              mathematics.       This research falls under the general heading of Number
              Theory. Number Theory  is the study of the properties of the whole numbers and
              is the oldest branch of  mathematics. From the beginning problems in number
              theory have furnished the driving  force to creation of new mathematics in
              almost all parts of the discipline. The  Langland's program is a general
              philosophy that connects number theory with calculus.   Modern number theory is
              very technical and deep, but it has had astonishing  applications in areas like
              theoretical computer science and coding theory. ***
