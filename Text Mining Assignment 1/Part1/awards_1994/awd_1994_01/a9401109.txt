Abstract    :
              9401108  Protter    This three-year continuing grant supports U.S.-France
              cooperative  research in numerical analysis of stochastic differential 
              equations (SDE).  The investigators are Philip Protter of Purdue  University,
              Thomas Kurtz of the University of Wisconsin, Denis  Talay, French National
              Institute for Research in Computer Science  and Applied Mathematics and Jean
              Jacod, University of Paris VI.   The investigators have identified six topics
              for exploration,  including studies of the discretization of stochastic 
              differential equations and their flows; applications to numerical  analysis of
              parabolic partial differential equations and to  mathematical finance; and
              numerical analysis of interacting  particle systems.    Stochastic differential
              equations deal with the modeling of  random dynamical systems and have been
              applied to models for  statistical communication theory, finance theory,
              control theory  among others.  With the advent of computers, it is now
              important  to analyze such models numerically.  The project takes advantage  of
              unique expertise of the INRIA researchers, who are world  leaders in stochastic
              differential equations. The results of this  work will further understanding of
              other numerical problems and  advance our understanding of the special nature
              of stochastic  differential equations.  SDEs could eventually replace, for 
              example, current financial models with more efficient and faster  computational
              models.  ***
