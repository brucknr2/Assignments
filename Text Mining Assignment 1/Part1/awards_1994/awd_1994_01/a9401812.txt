Abstract    :
              Abstract    Technical abstract:  Single-molecule transport will be studied using
               evanescent-wave coupling of light to microscopic tunnel junctions.  The
              primary experimental tool will be a scanning tunneling microscope  with optical
              access.  Alternative tunneling techniques will also be  investigated.  
              Molecular films to be studied will range from simple  molecules such as benzene
              to larger molecules with chromophores.      Non-technical abstract:  Molecular
              materials are viewed as potentially  valuable in electronic and opto-electronic
              devices.  There is  currently no adequate understanding of the electronic
              conduction  pathways within molecules at the single molecule level, or of the 
              mechanism by which current can enter and leave molecules through metal 
              contacts.  We propose to gain understanding of these processes by  probing
              suitable molecules in microscopic devices with  light pulses  which can
              interact with current carried on the conduction paths.
