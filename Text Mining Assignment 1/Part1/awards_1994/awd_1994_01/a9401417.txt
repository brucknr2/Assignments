Abstract    :
              9401417  Hempel       The research will focus on magnetic phenomena, starting
              with  situations where a thin layer of solid matter is locally  penetrated by a
              strong magnetic field. The mathematical problem  is to analyze the eigenvalues
              of the perturbed Schrodinger  operator in the gaps of the essential spectrum.
              The perturbation  occurs as a first order differential operator. A portion of
              the  project involves numerical computations of the eigenvalues. A  second
              project is to obtain a model for crystals with impurities.  In an attempt to be
              realistic, these models will consider the  case of a random distribution of
              impurities.       This project involves research in mathematical physics. In 
              mathematical physics one has to frequently analyze the effect of  local
              perturbations in a homogeneous or periodic reference  material. An important
              example is provided by solid state physics  where impurities in insulators or
              semi-conductors lead to new  energy levels, so-called impurity levels. These
              impurity levels  are basic for the quantum mechanical theory of the color of 
              crystals; in particular, lasers operate on such impurity levels.  Similarly
              these impurity levels affect the conductivity  properties of doped
              semi-conductors. These impurity levels are  studied mathematically by analyzing
              eigenvalues of perturbed  differential equations.  ***
