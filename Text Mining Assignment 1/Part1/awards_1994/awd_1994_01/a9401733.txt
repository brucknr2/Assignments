Abstract    :
                  It is proposed to continue to operate and analyze data from the  recently
              installed MACCS array of fluxgate magnetometers located at  cusp/cleft
              latitudes (75o to 80o in arctic Canada in a joint effort  with Augsburg
              College.  During the summers of 1992 and 1993 8  magnetometers were deployed at
              small communities in the eastern  arctic.  These eight observatories span
              nearly 5 hours in magnetic  local time in the latitude region most valuable for
              ground-based  observations of the magnetospheric boundary layer, and serve to 
              connect existing magnetometer sites in Alaska and western Canada to  the west
              and sites on Greenland and Baffin Island to the east.  In  addition, it is
              proposed here to add data loggers at three standard  Canadian observatories
              (Resolute, Cambridge Bay and Baker Lake).   This would allow to obtain 1 s data
              from these sites and routinely  combine this data with the MACCS data base so
              effectively extending  the MACCS array another hour to the west.    The purpose
              of the MACCS array is to study ionospheric currents,  plasma flows, and waves
              associated with the magnetospheric cusp and  neighboring regions.  In
              association with the radar systems  beginning to operate in this same area,
              these magnetometers will  provide high resolution, two-dimensional data on the 
              electrodynamics of cusp convection.   The MACCS data also contain  numerous
              high latitude substorm signatures.  As the GEM program  begins its substorm
              campaign, it is proposed to use MACCS data to  study the small, contracted oval
              substorms associated with  northward IMF, and the recovery phase of regular
              substorms during  which the activity moves poleward over the MACCS array.
