Abstract    :
              9401222  Scherson    This U.S.-Poland Joint Collaborative Research grant to
              study  "Efficient System Support for Data-Parallel MIMD" is between Dr.  Isaac
              D. Scherson of the Department of Information and Computer  Science, University
              of California Irvine, and Dr. Piotr  Chrzastowski-Wachtel of the Informatics
              Institute, Warsaw  University.  A novel massively parallel architecture, dubbed
              P3,  led to the identification of a number of important open problems  related
              to the feasibility, applicability and performance of very  large SIMD systems. 
              However, because of the strong recent trend  among commercial machines towards
              the SPMD-style of programming  on MIMD machines, the researchers are relaxing
              their previous  SIMD assumptions and applying their knowledge to SPMD system 
              support issues.  Specifically, their goal is to model the SPMD  paradigm and
              reduce or even eliminate barrier synchronization to  minimize wasteful
              processor idling.  To this end, the American  researchers will collaborate with
              the Polish researchers, who  have performed extensive work on algebras and
              models of  concurrency.  Additionally, the researchers hope this  international
              exchange will shed new light on their continuing  research (MIP-9106949,
              MIP-9205737) on scientific numerical  techniques, and the development of very
              fast and efficient  interconnective networks.      This proposed research in
              information and computer science and  engineering fulfills the program
              objectives of advancing science  by enabling leading experts in the U.S. and
              Poland to combine  complementary talents and pool research resources in areas
              of  strong mutual interest and competence.    ***
