Abstract    :
              9401723  Steinhorn       This project focuses upon questions having to do with 
              o-minimality and its extensions.  Some of these questions relate  to expansions
              of archetypal o-minimal structures and structures  whose domain has as its
              order type that of the real numbers.   Other problems concerning o-minimality
              are intended to develop  the structure of groups definable in o-minimal
              structures as far  as possible in analogy with locally Euclidean groups.  Among
              the  variants and extensions of o-minimality to be considered are weak 
              o-minimality and local o-minimality.  It is hoped that the latter  will provide
              a suitable framework for developing some model  theory for subanalytic sets. 
              Another goal of the research is to  begin to develop a general model theory for
              ordered structures,  patterned after stability theory.       The research
              described above falls under the heading of  model theory within the branch of
              mathematics called logic.   Model theory attempts to deal with the properties
              of familiar  mathematical structures which can be described by a formal 
              mathematical language such as predicate logic.  The focus of this  project is a
              class that includes and behaves very much like the  polynomial and algebraic
              functions based on the real numbers that  are studied in freshman calculus and
              are used to describe many  phenomena.  There has been much exciting progress
              during the past  five years, in which model theory has played a central role in
               deepening our understanding of familiar mathematical systems of  interest in
              diverse areas of mathematics outside of logic.  ***
