Abstract    :
              9401166  Langsetmo       This career advancement award supports mathematical
              research  in the field of topology.  The work continues studied in homotopy 
              theory involving the relationship between periodic homotopy and  higher Morava
              K-theories.  In particular, work will be done in  extending the construction of
              Dyer-Lashof operations and  calculating the Morava K-theory of infinite loop
              spaces.  The  calculation of the Morava K-theory of various finite loop spaces 
              and determining the when the cobar (base to fiber) spectral  sequence converges
              will also be carried out.  Further study of  the relationship between stable
              and unstable localization in the  case of non-connective homology theories and
              the relationship  between unstable periodic homotopy and periodic homology
              theories  via unstable localization and mapping telescopes are planned.  
              Finally, applications to related fields such as representation  theory will be
              considered.       Topology is the study of spaces in which shape and  distance
              become less important while qualities of connectedness  and deformability. 
              Homotopy, in particular, focuses on the  development of a mathematical
              structure which measures the extent  to which curves may or may not be deformed
              into one another while  constrained to stay on a particular surface or within a
              given  space.  ***
