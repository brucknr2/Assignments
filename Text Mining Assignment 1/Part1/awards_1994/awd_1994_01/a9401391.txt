Abstract    :
              9401391  Yukie       This award funds the research of Professor Akihiko Yukie in
               number theory.  Prof. Yukie will use the theory of prehomogeneous  vector
              fields to attempt to compute the density of certain  arithmetic objects.  In
              particular,  he believes that his  techniques can be used on arithmetic aspects
              of quartic and  quintic extensions of global fields.          This is research
              in the branch of mathematics known as  number theory.   Number theory at its
              most basic is the study of  whole numbers and their properties.  This theory
              begins with the  connections between whole numbers such as the divisibility of
              one  number by another.  In short order the theory includes some of  the most
              profound problems in science. It is among the oldest  fields of mathematics and
              was originally pursued for purely  aesthetic reasons.  However, within the last
              half century, it has  become an essential tool in developing new algorithms for
               computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics.
