                                        ABSTRACT                                  Kochanek,
              Christopher  AST-9401722    Gravitational lenses, particularly radio ring
              lenses, can  provide important new information on the structure of E and  S0
              galaxies.  This information is independent of traditional  dynamically studies,
              and it has radically different  systematic problems.  The greatest advantage of
              lens models  is that they directly measure the gravitational field in the 
              distant galaxy, thereby avoiding all the systematic  assumptions needed to
              determine the mass distribution from  dynamical studies.  This research will
              use algorithms for  inverting radio lenses to systematically invert the radio 
              lenses using families of mass models to determine the mass  distributions in
              the inner 5-10 kpc of the lens galaxies.  In cases where one sees the lens
              galaxy, the MMT will be  used to make dynamical measurements for comparisons. 
              This  will allow a direct calculation of the anisotropy of the  velocity
              dispersions, and a direct calculation of the mass  to light ratio.  There will
              also be algorithmic improvements  in the inversion method.  ***
