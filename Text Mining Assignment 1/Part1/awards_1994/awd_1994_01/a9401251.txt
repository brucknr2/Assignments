Abstract    :
              9401251  Friedman       This project is concerned with free boundary problems
              for  systems of partial differential equations.  Three classes of  problems are
              to be investigated: (i) Stefan type problems for a  reaction-diffusion system
              of nonlinear parabolic equations, (ii)  free boundary problems for
              Navier-Stokes equation (with a free  boundary which separates from the fixed
              boundary), and (iii)  plasma-type problems (reminiscent of the vortex patch
              problem)  arising when the motion of charged mass distribution is coupled  to
              the electric field generated by charged mass.  Some initial  progress has been
              made in each of these problems areas, but new  ideas and methods need to be
              developed for further progress.       Partial differential equations form a
              basis for mathematical  modeling of the physical world.  The role of
              mathematical  analysis is not so much to create the equations as it is to 
              provide qualitative and quantitative information about the  solutions.  This
              may include answers to questions about  uniqueness, smoothness and growth.  In
              addition, analysis  oftendevelops methods for approximation of solutions and 
              estimates on the accuracy of these approximations.  ***
