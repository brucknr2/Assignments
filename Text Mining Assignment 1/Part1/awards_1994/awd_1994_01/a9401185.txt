Abstract    :
              9401185  Guilbault       This award provides partial support for a workshop in 
              geometric topology to be held in each of the summers of 1995, 1996,  and 1997. 
              The 1995 workshop will be held on the campus of the  University of
              Wisconsin-Milwaukee, with Professors Fredric D. Ancel  and Craig R. Guilbault
              as the local organizers and Professor Shmuel  Weinberger of the University of
              Pennsylvania as the principal  lecturer.  The 1996 workshop will be held at
              Colorado College, and  the 1997 workshop will be held at Oregon State
              University.       Geometric topology treats the structure and properties of
              low-  dimensional topological manifolds.  Previous workshops in this  series
              have focused on such major developments in the field as the  solution of the
              knot-complement problem by Andrew Casson and John  Luecke.  The principal
              lectures on that occasion (1989) were given  by Luecke, whose solution
              confirmed the conjecture that a knot in   3-dimensional space is completely
              determined by its complement, which   is the residual space remaining after a
              worm has eaten its way along   the knot, leaving a knot-shaped tunnel behind.
