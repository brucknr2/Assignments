Abstract    :
              9401136  Overton  Nonsmooth optimization problems involve objectives or
              constraints  which are not differentiable everywhere.  The term structured 
              nonsmooth optimization means that the specific nonsmooth nature  of the problem
              is known.  One especially interesting class  repeatedly arises in many
              applications: problems involving  eigenvalues of matrices.  This work primarily
              focuses on various  aspects of eigenvalue optimization, including semidefinite 
              programming, quasiconvex eigenvalue optimization, and non-  Lipschitz
              eigenvalue optimization.    The goal is fourfold:  the development of fast,
              robust numerical  algorithms; analysis of theoretical questions concerning 
              optimality conditions and algorithm convergence; development of  software which
              can be used by the general scientific community;  application to the solution
              of important interesting problems  which arise in practice.  Application areas
              of particular  interest include combinatorial optimization, robust control and 
              structural analysis.  ***
