Abstract    :
              9401613  Bleiler       The Cascade Topology Seminar will be held at a series of 
              universities in the Pacific Northwest on a semiannual basis over  the three
              years beginning in the fall of 1994.  While topological  topics will
              predominate, the range will include geometry and  analysis.  The stated
              objectives are to provide frequent contacts  between workers in similar fields,
              to keep the area abreast of  recent developments by bringing in speakers from
              outside the  area, to encourage local graduate students and topologists to 
              hear, consult, and possibly collaborate with the outside  speakers, and to
              provide an opportunity for local people to  lecture on their own work. 
              Inclusion of graduate students will  continue to be a very important aspect of
              the sessions.  ***
