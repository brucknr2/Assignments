Abstract    :
              9401848  Spitkovsky       The project involves work on operator theory and
              matrix  theory. Five specific projects are outlined: 1. Fredholm theory  of
              Toeplitz, Weiner-Hopf and pseudodifferential operators on  spaces with general
              Hunt-Muckenhoupt-Wheeden weights. Almost  periodic factorization of matrix
              functions and its applications  to extension and interpolation problems of
              Analysis. 3. Explicit  solutions of integral equations and boundary problems
              emerging  from applications to diffraction theory, elasticity and 
              thermodynamics. 4. Further analysis of the structure of Banach  algebras
              generated by two projections. 5. Contragredient  canonical forms of pairs of
              Hermitian matrices and their  applications.       The project centers around
              the theory of systems of singular  integral equations. Historically, these
              equations grew out of the  study of the equation of the airfoil and other
              applications in  the mechanics of materials. The basic tool for solving these 
              singular integral equations is the method of Wiener-Hopf  factorization. The
              matrix form of this factorization was  developed independently by electrical
              engineers to study linear  systems theory. A part of the project deals with
              explicit  factorization and this would have application in engineering 
              problems. When completed, the theoretical portion of the project  will be a
              significant advance in the theory of matrix function  factorization.  ***
