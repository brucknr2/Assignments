Abstract    :
              9401738  Batiza       The PIs will purchase an ICP-MS.  This instrument allows 
              determination of a large number of trace elements and some  isotopes with great
              precision.  Thirty scientists within SOEST  will use this machine.  The
              research to be covered ranges from  marine geology to atmospheric sciences.
