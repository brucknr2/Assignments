Abstract    :
              9401688  Hurder       The study of geometric properties of open complete
              manifolds  is a rapidly developing area of research in pure mathematics.  
              Hurder's research program seeks to gain a deeper understanding of  geometric
              and dynamical phenomenon on open manifolds by exploring  the "structures at
              infinity" and asymptotic symmetries of spaces.   His investigation combines
              techniques from coarse cohomology,  cyclic cohomology, buildings, dynamics and
              spectral theory of  Dirac-type operators.  The structure theory for the
              asymptotic  behavior of actions has become much more sophisticated in recent 
              years, and is an emerging technology of choice for addressing  some well-known
              problems regarding the classification of open  manifolds and the symmetry
              groups on these spaces.       The problems addressed in this work are also
              closely tied to  mathematical physics and explaining natural phenomenon, 
              especially the work relating asymptotic structures on open spaces  to the
              spectral theory of geometric operators.  Other aspects of  the project are
              currently being applied to the analysis of  computer simulations of tiling maps
              and random dynamics of  motions in two and three space, with eventual
              applications to  explaining the behavior of gases (the higher dimensional
              billiard  problem).  ***
