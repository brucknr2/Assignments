Abstract    :
                9401520  Imbrie       This proposal is for mathematical research on 
              fundamental problems in condensed matter physics and high energy  physics. The
              proposed research includes rigorous renormalization  group methods in the
              theory of critical phenomena (self-avoiding  walk and other interacting polymer
              systems, random Schroedinger  operators).  Additional research is planned on
              the phase  structure of supersymmetric field theory models and the way it is 
              constrained by index theorems.  Further problems include the  study of the
              crossover from lattice- constrained interfaces to  continuum interfaces near
              the critical temperature in Ising-like  systems.       Physical systems such as
              magnets or polymers  exhibit characteristic behavior as they undergo a change
              of  state. For example, the length over which atoms are  correlated grows
              without bound as a magnetization begins to set  in. Length scales for
              correlations grow as a power law in the  temperature or other parameters.  The
              goal of this proposal is to  develop the mathematics needed to understand these
              phenomena.  Application of these ideas will be pursued in the study of 
              polymers, particles and fields, and surfaces.  ***
