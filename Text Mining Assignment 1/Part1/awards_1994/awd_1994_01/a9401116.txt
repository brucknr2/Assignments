Abstract    :
              9401116  Evans         This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral 
              Dissertation Research Program.  It is a study of the impact of  German
              reunification on East German women, based on in-depth  interviews conducted
              with eastern German couples who have  children.  Topics covered by the
              interviews will include: 1)  employment in the new, capitalist labor market, 2)
              child care  arrangements before and after unification, and 3) financial and 
              emotional dependency of partners.  Current German government  policies have the
              effect of encouraging women to leave the labor  force to have families, while
              former East German policy did the  opposite.  Thus, this research will examine
              an area where  governmental change may have a substantial impact, thus 
              permitting the testing of sociological theories of national  transition.  %%%  
                  The research supported in this award will contribute to  social-scientific
              understanding of transnational aspects of  global change and democratization. 
              Across the world, massive  shifts in government policies can be expected to
              affect  decisively the context in which individuals and families make  career
              decisions, and through these decisions, the social and  economic status of
              women.  In addition to the scientific gains to  be achieved by the research,
              this award will materially assist a  highly promising student in completing
              research for the Ph.D.  dissertation.  Thus it contributes to the future
              scientific  manpower of the nation and the thorough training of the next 
              generation of social scientists.    ***
