Abstract    :
                         The project concerns the development of techniques for solving some 
              new types of integral equations, and the application of these techniques to a 
              variety of physical problems.  Of particular interest are equations of 
              Volterra type whose solution experiences a blow-up, and equations of Fredholm 
              type whose solution exhibits boundary layer effects.  The areas of application 
              include (i) localized plastic straining effects in high-strength metals, (ii) 
              the ignition of combustible solid materials, and (iii) the migration of atomic 
              impurities in crystals.          The project concerns the development and 
              application of new techniques for solving certain scientific and engineering 
              problems which can be formulated in mathematical terms as an integral or 
              integro-differential equation.  The results will be used to enhance the 
              understanding of phenomena which exhibit explosive behavior, such as the 
              ignition and burning of solid matter.  Related applications concern the 
              failure of high-strength metals which undergo viscoplastic strain due to 
              extreme loading.  Another area of potential use concerns the effects of 
              impurities in crystalline materials.
