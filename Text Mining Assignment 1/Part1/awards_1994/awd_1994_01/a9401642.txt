Abstract    :
              9401642  Cox       The Valley Geometry Seminar runs series of lectures and 
              workshops in diverse areas of geometry and its applications.  Such areas
              include differential and algebraic geometry, number  theory and mathematical
              physics. Seminars are conducted by  invited speakers who are leading authorites
              in these fields and  are aimed towards fellow-researchers and graduate
              students.  ***
