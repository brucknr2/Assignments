Abstract    :
              This project is concerned with finite geometries and groups.  There are four
              areas which will be considered.  The principal investigator will extend
              previous work on embeddings and hyperplanes of point-line geometries; work on
              characterizing parapolar spaces; study new cases of the connections between
              m-spreads and constructions of generalized quadrangles; and see if frames can
              be used to generate the full Lie incidence geometry.  The principal
              investigator will attempt in all the above work to understand groups by how
              they act on geometries.           The research in this project involves the
              interplay between finite dimensional geometry and the actions of groups of
              transformations on these geometries.  This work has implications for the
              structure of finite groups, for algebraic coding theory, and for finite
              geometry. ***
