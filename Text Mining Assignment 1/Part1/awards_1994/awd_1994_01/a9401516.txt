Abstract    :
              9401516  Klassen       Eric Klassen and Paul Kirk intend to develop powerful
              tools  to compute and analyze gauge-theoretic invariants of  3-dimensional
              manifolds, particularly Chern-Simons invariants and  the spectral flow of the
              signature operator, with an emphasis on  manifolds with boundary.  The
              techniques to be used include the  theory of boundary-value problems for Dirac
              operators, Massey  products in differential graded Lie algebras, and the 
              representation theory of fundamental groups of 3-manifolds.       Over the last
              decade, gauge theoretic topology has grown  into one of the most important
              current fields of mathematical  research.  It involves an interaction of ideas
              from topology,  analysis, differential and algebraic geometry, and theoretical 
              physics.  The exciting techniques resulting from this interaction  have been
              used to answer fundamental questions about 3- and  4-dimensional manifolds
              which had been completely resistant to  pre-gauge theory methods.  The research
              to be undertaken forms  one of the basic ingredients of both the 3- and
              4-dimensional  theories; it will provide information important for
              cut-and-paste  methods in the 4-dimensional Donaldson theory, as well as 
              providing computations for 3-dimensional topological quantum  field theory.
