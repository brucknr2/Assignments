Abstract    :
              9401582  Enflo       The proposers plan to work on two projects involving
              bounded  operators on Hilbert space. The first project is to study orbits  of
              cyclic vectors of operators. In particular, different  regularity properties of
              these orbits. The second project  involves a study of some aspects of invariant
              subspaces using  recently developed techniques of the proposers. The focus here
              is  on quasinilpotent operators.       Operators on Hilbert space represent an
              infinite dimensional  generalization of matrices. It is a well known fact that
              given a  matrix there is always a vector such that the span of iterates of  the
              matrix action on this vector is not the whole vector space.  This project is
              focused on the analogous question in the infinite  dimensional case.
              Appropriately formulated, this question is  called the invariant subspace
              problem. It has been the focus of  much research on operator theory. The
              question is an attempt to  decompose operators into building `locks and is
              central to the  analysis of the structure of operators.  ***
