Abstract    :
              The objective is to develop a new computational model of the large-  scale
              dynamics of the Earth's magnetosphere by merging two existing  models: (i) the
              global 3d MHD code that was orginially developed at  the Naval Research
              Laboratory, and (ii) the Rice Convection Model  (RCM).  The merged code will
              retain the self-consistency and  comprehensiveness of the MHD code and will
              include the bow shock,  magnetosheath, solar-wind/magnetosphere interactions,
              as well as  the distant tail.  But the merged code will also utilize the Rice 
              Convection Model's finely gridded, many-fluid representation of the  inner
              magnetosphere and near-Earth plasma sheet.  In addition, the  RCM's
              representation of the magnetospheric interior will be  substanitally improved
              through the use of the self-consistent time-  dependent magnetic field supplied
              by the MHD model.  Merger of the  two codes will be accomplished in three
              phases, with careful  testing and analysis at each step.  In each phase, the
              code will be  used to simulate specific, well-observed magnetospheric events,
              and  simulation results will be tested against observations obtained in  GEM
              campaigns.
