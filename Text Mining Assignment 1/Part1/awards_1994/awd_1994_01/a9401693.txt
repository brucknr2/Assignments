Abstract    :
                9401693  Duren        This work will continue mathematical research on
              problems  arising in the theory of analytic functions and related questions 
              involving harmonic mappings.  To a large degree, the effort  continues several
              lines of research which have opened new  directions of investigation.  Work
              will be done extending recent  results on zero-divisors for functions in
              Bergman spaces defined  in a disc.  These are spaces of analytic functions
              whose norms  are defined with respect to area integration of their powers.  
              The long-sought solution to the zero divisor problem was obtained  by
              Hedenmalm; it opens the door to investigations into the  classification of
              invariant subspaces analogous to the classical  result of Beurling for the
              Hardy spaces.  Considerable work still  remains, almost nothing has been
              established about these spaces  to date, especially on the question of
              existence of extremal  functions.  Work will also be done investigating plane
              harmonic  mappings, i.e. mappings for which each component is harmonic.   Such
              mappings are directly related to solutions of minimal  surface problems. 
              Questions of concern center on finding good  estimates for the Gaussian
              curvature of a nonparametric minimal  surface above the disc in terms of the
              so-called dilatation of a  harmonic map and on determining the shape of images
              of extremal  harmonic maps.         Classical function theory has introduced
              geometric  techniques which have proved to have far wider applicability than 
              first imagined.  The subject exploits the interplay between  geometric
              interpretation with powerful analytic techniques to  yield some of the most
              complete mathematical results in the field  of analysis.In this project,
              variational techniques and geometric  reasoning are expected to lead to results
              of valuable physical  significance.   ***
