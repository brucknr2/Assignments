Abstract    :
                9401440  Baum       The BC (= Baum-Connes) conjecture is an extremely general 
              equality relating topology, i.e. continuous geometry, and  analysis, i.e. the
              branch of mathematics based on multi-variable  calculus.  This conjecture is
              unusual in that it cuts across  several different areas of mathematics and thus
              reveals an  underlying unity which previously was completely unknown.  The 
              research pursued here centers on proving this conjecture for  certain classes
              of examples and then obtaining corollaries.  More  precisely, let G be a
              topological group which is Hausdorff,  locally compact and second countable. 
              The main examples are Lie  groups, p-adic groups and discrete groups.  C*G
              denotes the  reduced C*-algebra of G, and KC*G is its K-theory.  The BC 
              conjecture, if true, gives an answer to the problem of  calculating KC*G. 
              Validity of the conjecture has applications to  well-known problems in
              geometry-topology and representation  theory.  ***
