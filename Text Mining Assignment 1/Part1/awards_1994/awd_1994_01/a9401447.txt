Abstract    :
              Professor Morrison will work on research on the border between  theoretical
              physics and algebraic geometry. He will use algebraic  geometric techniques to
              study conformal field theory. In  particular he intends to further study the
              recently discovered  phenomenon of mirror symmetry.    This is research in the
              field of algebraic geometry, yet it  directly connects to two of the great
              advances in theoretical  physics in this century--quantum mechanics and general
               relativity. Algebraic geometry itself is one of the oldest parts  of modern
              mathematics, but one which has had a revolutionary  flowering in the past
              quarter-century. In its origin, it treated  figures that could be defined in
              the plane by the simplest  equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field
              makes use of  methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and topology, 
              and conversely is finding application in those fields as well as  in physics,
              theoretical computer science, and robotics.
