Abstract    :
              This award supports the principal investigator's role as a campaign  coordinator
              for the GEM (Geospace Environment Modeling) Program's  cusp and boundary layer
              working group.  In addition, the PI will  analyze the data from GEM observing
              campaigns to determine polar  cap potential patterns and their relation to
              dayside boundary  regions and the boundary between open and closed field lines.
               As  campaign coordinator, the PI will plan and implement a program to  specify
              the magnetopause boundary-normal magnetic field and the  reconnection electric
              field.  He will be involved in the  coordination of observations and will
              facilitate and participate in  comparison between the observations and
              theoretical models.  As  part of the research effort, the campaign data will be
              used for  determining the dayside magnetic reconnection rate and its temporal 
              and spatial variations, and for evaluating the cause of temporal  changes in
              the polar cap convective flow near the dayside  separatrix.
