Abstract    :
              9401735  Shubin       This proposal concerns problems from inverse spectral
              theory  and random Schrodinger operator theory. The problems proposed in  the
              inverse spectral theory section center around recovering  certain types of
              singularities of the potential of a Schrodinger  operator from the set of
              eigenvalues. The problems from random  Schrodinger operator theory concern
              localization in d-dimensional  Euclidean space for Anderson and Poisson type
              models.       Modern physics, quantum mechanics and relativity is a  product of
              the twentieth century. It is founded firmly in the  attempt to address the
              microstructure of matter and to come  to grips with the concept of action-at-a
              distance,  electro-magnetism, and heat radiation. The mathematical  foundations
              for these developments, collectively called  mathematical physics, ranges from
              detailed analysis of  Schrodinger operators, which governs the dynamics of
              particles,  to unified field theory, which attempts to unite the four known 
              forces into a single theory.  This project is focused on the  Schrodinger
              operator component of mathematical physics research.  ***
