Abstract    :
              9401627   Bass                  This award supports research on a number of
              questions in  group theory using geometric methods.  The principal investigator
               will work on linearizing flat families of reductive group  representations;
              renormalization in interval dynamics and  automorphism groups of rooted trees;
              calculating the stabilizer,  in the outer automorphism group, of the hyperbolic
              length  function of a simplicial tree action; developing the theory of 
              non-uniform tree lattices;  and several topics in the  representation theory of
              finitely generated groups.                  A lattice is a set of objects
              together with an order on  these objects such that any pair of objects has a
              greatest lower  bound and a least upper bound.  Lattices have shown to be quite
               useful in the study of Lie groups.  In a similar spirit this  project will
              explore lattices in the automorphism group of  certain trees.  This work is of
              interest to many different areas  of mathematics.  It also has potential
              applications in  information theory.
