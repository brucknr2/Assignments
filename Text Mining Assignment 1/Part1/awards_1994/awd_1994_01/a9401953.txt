              Abstract    ATM-9401953  Mayewski, Paul A.  University of New Hampshire  Title:
              An Asian Paleoclimate Workshop, Nepal, April 1995    Climate Change is one of
              the great intellectual challenges faced by  science and one of the great
              unknowns for civilization.  Due to the  extreme socio-economic ramifications of
              the environmental changes  produced as a consequence of climate change, the
              international  scientific community is currently attempting to understand this 
              phenomena.  This award provides for the partial support for an  international
              workshop entitled: "Himlayan/Tibetan Plateau  Paleoclimate Workshop."  The
              workshop is scheduled to be held in  Nepal during early April 1995.  This
              meeting will be held also  under the auspices of IGBP/PAGES and builds on the
              recommendations  of the PAGES meeting on "High Resolution Record of Past
              Climate  from Monsoon Asia," (Taiwan, 1993).  The Nepal workshop will focus  on
              interpreting and developing paleoclimate records from central  Asia, a key
              region for completing  the spatial framework of the  global paleo-dataset
              required for understanding global climate and  environmental change. 
              Researchers from Asia, the United States,  Europe, and Canada will synthesize,
              organize, and stimulate a   rigorous paleoclimate program for Asia.  Workshop
              participants will  produce a substantive summary and interpretation of existing
               paleoclimate records, followed by a Science and Implementation Plan  with
              recommendations for the future course of paleoclimate research  in this region.
