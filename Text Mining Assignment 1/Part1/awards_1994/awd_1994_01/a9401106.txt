Abstract    :
              9401106  Ye   The scope of the research centers around the study of classes of 
              geometric evolution equations. The equations in question  characterize flow
              systems relating to Ricci curvature, Yang-Mills  gradient and harmonic maps as
              some of the types. It is also  intended to outline constructions of Einstein
              metrics on  manifolds in certain cases. The research may have potential 
              applications to gauge theory and general relativity theory in  mathematical
              physics.  ***
