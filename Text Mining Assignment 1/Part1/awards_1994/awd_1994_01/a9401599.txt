Abstract    :
              9401599  Liu    This project is to investigate systematically the interaction 
              between the Tropical and subtropical thermocline circulation's by  developing
              both a general circulation model and analytical models.   Two main topics will
              be investigated:  the exchange of water  between the tropical-subtropical
              system and what determines the  structure of the mean equatorial thermocline. 
              The research is  directed towards providing a valuable contribution to the 
              understanding of the climate variability both for the Atlantic and  Pacific
              regions.
