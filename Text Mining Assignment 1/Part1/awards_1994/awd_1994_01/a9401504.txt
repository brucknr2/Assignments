Abstract    :
              9401504  Minda       This award supports a continuing program of mathematical 
              research applying differential geometric methods to a variety of  problems in
              complex function theory.  The common thread joining  the parts of the
              investigation is the use of conformal  geometries, especially the three
              classical geometries:  hyperbolic, euclidean and spherical.  Comparison results
              will be  sought, that is, relating quantities in one conformal geometry to 
              like quantities in another.  Work will also be done analyzing  holomorphic
              functions viewed as mappings from on geometry  to another.  For example, Bloch
              functions are precisely  those holomorphic functions from hyperbolic to
              euclidean geometry  which have bounded distortion.  Ongoing research is also
              focusing  on two-point comparisons for conformal geometries.  This  will
              directly apply to the understanding of two-point distortions  for univalent
              functions.  Finally, work will be done  using subordination principles as the
              basis for a systematic  study of Bloch functions.  This approach has yet to be
              employed  seriously.       This project represents research at the boundary  of
              differential geometry and classical complex function theory.   The tools
              available are considerable, in the hands of  investigators who have mastered
              the techniques of both areas.  ***
