Abstract    :
              9401027  Sundberg       Richter and Sundberg will investigate the invariant
              sbspace   lattices of the operator of multiplication by an analytic   function
              on Banach or Hilbert spaces of analytic functions. The   spaces that will be
              investigated include the Dirichlet and   Bergman spaces on the open unit disc,
              as well as Hardy spaces of   more general domains in the complex plane. These
              invariant   subspace problems are related naturally to questions from  
              classical analysis, such as questions about zero sets and sets of  uniqueness.
              The new technique involved in these investigation  will be that of "extremal
              functions" in invariant subspaces.  Operator theory is that branch of
              mathematics that treats objects  that are infinite generalizations of finite
              matrices. Frequently,  these operators can be given realization as
              mutiplications on  certain collections of functions. In this form the invariant
               subspace and classification problem are related to natural  function existence
              and interpolation questions. This project will  contribute to both the
              classification problem and the related  concrete function existence problems.
