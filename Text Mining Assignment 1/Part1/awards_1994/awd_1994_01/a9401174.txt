Abstract    :
              9401174  Muhly       Muhly will investigate a range of problems in the structure
               theory of operator algebras. He will concentrate on the question  of how the
              collection of Hilbert space representations of an  operator algebra (or the
              category of Hilbert modules over the  algebra) reflect on the algebra. He will
              study, too, the  structure of operator spaces that are modules over 
              operatoralgebras.       Operators can be viewed as infinite dimensional
              versions of  matrices. operators have a natural addition and multiplication 
              and a collection of operators can be consider as a mathematical  structure
              referred to as an operator algebra. These operator  algebras can be represented
              in various explicit manners and Muhly  will look at how the various
              representations reflect on the  algebra. He will also study applications of
              operator algebras  to questions of design and control theory. Particular 
              attention will be given to applications to neural networks and to 
              non-stationary control theory that occurs in materials production  and  noise
              abatement.  ***
