Abstract    :
              9401487  Groemer        The research entails the geometry of convex bodies and 
              their relationship with Legendre polynomials and spherical  harmonics. Various
              packing type problems in convexity will also  be studied. The scope of this
              research has potential applications  to vibration engineering, robotics and
              automated sensing.  ***
