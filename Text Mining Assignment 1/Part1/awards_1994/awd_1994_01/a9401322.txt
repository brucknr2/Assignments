Abstract    :
              9401322  Richards       Richards will continue his research on hypergeometric 
              functions defined on matrix spaces and symmetric cones, with  special attention
              to be paid to developing the theory of  operator-valued hypergeometric
              functions on symmetric cones.         This research is in the area of analysis
              on symmetric  spaces.  The main objective is to develop a theory of special 
              functions similar to the classical case of special functions  defined on
              domains in complex n-dimensional space.  ***
