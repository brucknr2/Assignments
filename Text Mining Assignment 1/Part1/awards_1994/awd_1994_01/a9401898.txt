Abstract    :
              9401898  Musgrave    This project is a contribution to the Indian Ocean
              Expedition (IOE)  of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE).  In it, the
              PI  will participate as a co-principal investigator on the hydrographic  survey
              through the Arabian Sea, denoted as WOCE line, I-7N.  The PI  will then
              participate in the analysis and synthesis of the data on  these and other
              sections collected as part of the IOE.  Objectives  are to describe water
              characteristics, velocity structure, and  transport of the boundary currents
              thought to exist in the region.   The observations will provide the foundation
              for the first  measurements of the meridional overturning rate in the Indian 
              Ocean.  ***
