Abstract    :
              9401515  Pasnicu       The proposed research has two major objectives:  1.To 
              classify all the real rank zero (stable rank one) AH algebras by  their graded
              ordered scaled group. 2. To obtain nonstable  K-theory results for AH algebras.
              The completion of the first  project would be a major step in the
              classification problem of  separable nuclear C*-algebras by invariants. The
              completion of  the second project will give a positive answer to an important 
              conjecture of Blackadar and will provide important information in  itself and
              also concerning the classification of nuclear  C*-algebras.       Operators are
              infinite dimensional generalizations of  matrices that possess a natural
              addition and multiplication.  There is a natural involution called the adjoint
              operation on  operators that behaves much like the transpose operation 
              (reflection in the diagonal) on square matrices. A collection of  operators
              that is closed under addition, multiplication, the  adjoint operation and has a
              certain topological property is  called a C*-algebra. These algebras are
              important in several  branches of mathematics as well as in mathematical
              physics and  dynamical systems theory. The C*-algebras investigated here are 
              ones that are built out of matrix algebras in a limiting manner.  The basic
              goal is to classify these important algebras using  simple invariants.  ***
