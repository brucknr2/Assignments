Abstract    :
              9401740  Mather       Mather intends to continue his work on dynamics of 
              Hamiltonian systems.  In the past, much of his work has been on  dynamics of
              area-preserving mappings and autonomous systems in  two degrees of freedom. 
              More recently, he has extended part of  this work to more degrees of freedom,
              in his recent paper,  "Variational Construction of Connecting Orbits." 
              However, this  paper is only a beginning in this direction, in the sense that
              it  should be possible to obtain similar results under much more  general
              hypotheses.  Proving the existence of connecting orbits  between minimal sets
              under more general hypotheses will be a  major part of Mather's research.      
              As an example of what one might do with such results,  consider the restricted
              three-body problem in the plane, i.e. the  mechanical problem with a Newtonian
              gravitational potential, two  massive bodies and one body of zero mass, all in
              the plane.  In  the case that the two massive bodies move about one another in 
              circular orbits, Moser showed, in the early 60's, that if the  zero mass body
              moves in an approximately circular orbit a long  distance from the massive
              bodies, then it does not escape to  infinity.  Thus one has stability.  This is
              part of KAM theory.   In contrast, if the massive bodies move about one another
              in  elliptical orbits, no such result is known.  Mather's methods  might lead
              to a proof that such a result is false.  There are,  however, major hurdles to
              be overcome before this program can be  carried out.  ***
