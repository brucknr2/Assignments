Abstract    :
              9401204   Thompson                  This award supports research on three areas
              in matrix  theory.  The first concerns a formula for the product of matrix 
              exponentials the proof of which has inspired a new and deeper  question.  The
              principal investigator will work on solving this  new question.  The second
              area concerns the study of the  invariants of matrix products for matrices over
              a noncommutative  domain.  The third area of research concerns the numerical
              range  of matrices over a noncommutative domain.  A natural place to  begin
              these numerical range studies is with matrices having  quaternion entries.     
                            This research is in the general area of matrix theory.  A  matrix
              is a rectangular array.  Matrices can be used to represent  a wide variety of
              situations in mathematics, engineering,  statistics, physics, economics, and
              the life and social sciences.
