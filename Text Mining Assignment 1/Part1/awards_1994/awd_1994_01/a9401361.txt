Abstract    :
              Lyubeznik         A large part of the principal investigator's research on local
               cohomology has been devoted to the study of a number of striking connections
              with  several quite diverse areas of mathematics, such as etale cohomolgy,
              topology of  algebraic varieties, D-modules and others.  While considerable
              progress on this circle of  ideas has been made recently, a lot remains to be
              done.  This is especially true for the  applications of D-modules to local
              cohomology which is a completely new area of  research.  The principal
              investigato will work on these questions by using methods that  have been
              successful in the past as well as developing some new methods.          This 
              research is concerned with a number of questions in commutative algebra and
              algebraic  geometry.  Algebraic geometry studies solutions of families of
              polynomial equations.   One can either study the geometry of the solution set
              or approach problems  algebraically by investigating certain functions on the
              solution set that form what is  called a commutative ring.  This dual
              perspective creates a close connection between  commutative algebra and
              algebraic geometry. ***
