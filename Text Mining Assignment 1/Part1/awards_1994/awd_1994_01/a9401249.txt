Abstract    :
              9401249  Hittle  The objective of this research project is to increase the 
              efficiency of control methods for energy systems in buildings.  IN meeting this
              objective, novel combinations of feedback  controllers and neural network
              learning algorithms will be  developed.    to achieve the objective, recent
              developments in reinforcement  learning methods for neural networks will be
              adapted to the HVAC  system control problem.  Neural networks will not be the
              sole  source of control decisions for such a complex system.  Adaptive  schemes
              are notorious for leading to instabilities.  to lessen  the possibility of
              introducing instability, adaptive schemes will  be integrated with existing,
              fixed controllers.  the adaptive  methods will only augment the control actions
              taken by the fixed  controllers and a limit will be enforced on the degree to
              which  the fixed controller's decision can be modified.  This will  result in a
              control system with an initial performance at the  level provided by the
              original control designer.  Then, with  experience, the learning mechanism will
              be able to increase the  performance of the controller beyond its initial
              ability.    Results will certainly be of interest to building engineers, but 
              will also advance the sate-of-the-art in neural networks for  control.  ***
