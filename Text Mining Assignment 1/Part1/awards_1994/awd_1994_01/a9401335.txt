Abstract    :
              Sethuraman             This award supports work on three broad problems in the
              valuation theory of  division algebras.  The first problem is the study of
              non-tamely valued division algebras  over complete fields of finite
              characteristic, and in particular, the study of the subfields  of such algebras
              in terms of their valuation theory.  The second problem is the study of 
              division algebras defined over function fields of curves and the study of
              valuations on  these algebras that are non-trivial on the field of constants. 
              The principal investigator  will also work on the classification of the Kummer
              subfields of tame division algebras  over Henselian valued fields.            
              The research supported is in the general area of field theory.  Fields are 
              algebraic structures similar to the rational numbers, the real numbers, and the
              complex  numbers in that each nonzero element has an inverse with respect to
              multiplication.   Field theory is a rich and deep subject with its historical
              roots arising from the early  attempts to systematically describe the zeros of
              polynomials. ***
