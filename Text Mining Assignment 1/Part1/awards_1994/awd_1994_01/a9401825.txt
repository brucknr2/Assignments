Abstract    :
              9401825  Weinstein       The research covers topics in the geometry of Lorentz 
              surfaces concerning their diffeomorphisms and embeddings into  Minkowski
              3-space. Conformal structures of time-like surfaces  will also be studied. The
              research has potential applications to  general relativity theory and string
              theory in mathematical  physics.  ***
