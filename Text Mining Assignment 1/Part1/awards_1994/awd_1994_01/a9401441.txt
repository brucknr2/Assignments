Abstract    :
              9401441  LI       This award supports mathematical research into the 
              qualitative properties of nonlinear elliptic partial differential  equations
              and their application to problems in geometry.  Work  involves the study of
              travelling wave fronts on infinite  cylinders arising from flame propagation
              and ignition in  combustion theory and population dynamics.  Previous studies 
              showed that the solutions of the evolutions problems approach  some stable
              travelling wave fronts with certain speeds.  There  are cases where only one
              wave front exists.  In other cases  there are more and part of this
              investigation is to find the  stable wave front.  Work will also be done using
              the method of  moving planes in the study of semilinear elliptic equations 
              with critical and sub-critical Sobolev exponents.  The goal here  is to
              classify solutions which can then be carried over to  fully nonlinear
              equations.  Continuing work on the problem  of prescribing Gaussian curvature
              on surfaces will also be  carried out.  This is sometimes referred to as the
              Kazdan-Warner  problem.  One seeks necessary and sufficient conditions for the 
              solvability of the prescribed Gauss curvature via conformal  changes of metric.
                    Partial differential equations form a basis for  mathematical modeling of
              the physical world.  The role of  mathematical analysis is not so much to
              create the equations as  it is to provide qualitative and quantitative
              information about  the solutions.  This may include answers to questions  about
              uniqueness, smoothness and growth.  In addition, analysis  often develops
              methods for approximation of solutions and  estimates on the accuracy of these
              approximations.  ***
