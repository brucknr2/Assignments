Abstract    :
              9401300  Price     The study consists of a series of numerical experiments to
              study  the  broadening of outflows of dense water from marginal seas  to 
              adjacent  oceans.   The method will be to run a three-dimensional  ocean  model
               and  analyze the simulated outflows  that  will  be  guided  by existing
              observations.  The model uses the hydrostatic  primitive  equations, with
              horizontal resolution of 5  km  along-  stream, and 2 km across-stream on a 60
              x 100 grid (domain size is  300 by 200 km).  Specific questions to be addressed
              are: (1) what  processes  set the range of the product water T-S
              characteristics  in a given outflow?; (2) how does the overlying ocean
              circulation  interact  with an outflow?; and, (3) can a large scale baroclinic 
              instability  of an outflow alter the mean T-S characteristics  of  the product
              water?      ***
