Abstract    :
              9401138  ARCHER      Uranium is removed from the ocean by precipitation in
              chemically-  reducing sediments.  Here, we present preliminary results from the
               subantarctic South Atlantic showing high rates of authigenic U  deposition in
              glacial-age sediments.  There is no analog for such  high rates of authigenic U
              deposition in modern pelagic sediments.   The observed burial of uranium
              implies that one of two conditions  existed in the glacial ocean: either
              greatly-reduced oxygen content  of Circumpolar Deep Water (compared to modern
              levels in excess of  200 micromolar), or greatly-enhanced biological
              productivity of  subantarctic surface waters. Either condition would represent
              a  significant feature of the carbon cycle in the glacial ocean.    Our
              hypothesis is that subantarctic sediments hold the key record  which will lead
              to the long-sought explanation for lower  atmospheric CO2 concentrations during
              the ice ages.    Our goals are not only to test this hypothesis, but to derive 
              quantitative information about ice-age ocean productivity and deep-  sea O2
              content.
