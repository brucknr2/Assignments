Abstract    :
              Levine               The principal investigator will continue his study of the
              motivic  category and other related constructions.  He will investigate the
              relationship between  the integral motivic cohomology and Bloch's higher Chow
              groups, to construct a  weight structure and a duality on the motivic category,
              and to relate the motivic Tate  category with the motivic Lie algebra
              constructed by Bloch and Kriz.  He plans to lift  various constructions in
              Hodge theory to the motivic setting and to study mod n  motivic cohomology. 
              The principal investigator will also use some new ideas of  Hoobler to attack
              Kato's conjecture and will give a construction of a candidate for  weight two
              cohomology.            This research is concerned with algebraic K-theory.   In
              a broad sense algebraic K-theory concerns the evolution of concepts from linear
               algebra such as basis and vector space.  This work has significant
              implications for  number theory and algebraic geometry, and promises to make
              exciting connections  between a number of different areas in mathematics. ***
