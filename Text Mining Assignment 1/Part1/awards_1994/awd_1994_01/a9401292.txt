Abstract    :
              9401292 Parshall                This project is concerned with the modular
              representation  theory of algebraic and associated finite groups.  The
              principal  investigators are interested in a solution of the famous  conjecture
              of Lusztig for characters of the irreducible  representations in characteristic
              larger than the Coxeter number.   A successful solution to this problem would
              have many  ramifications for finite groups.  The work of the principal 
              investigators has already established an important connection  between the
              representation theory of algebraic groups and the  theory of finite dimensional
              algebras.  The principal  investigators will also work on problems concerning
              finite  groups, Lie algebras, and quantum groups.                The research
              supported concerns the representation theory of  finite groups.  A group is an
              algebraic object used to study  transformations.  Because of this, groups are a
              fundamental tool  in physics, chemistry and computer science as well as 
              mathematics.  Representation theory is an important method for  determining the
              structure of groups.
