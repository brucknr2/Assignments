Abstract    :
              9401389   Lin                  The principal investigator will study further
              relations  between quantum groups and the representations of algebraic  groups
              in characteristic p.  The first part of the research is to  study various
              intertwining homomorphisms over an integral domain  for quantum groups. This
              will provide a new class of  homomorphisms for Weyl modules.  The second part
              of the research  is to study the contravariant bilinear forms on a quantum Weyl
               module over an integral domain by using the Joseph inductions to  explore the
              relations between the Jantzen filtrations for both  quantum groups and
              algebraic groups.  The last problem is to  explore the Andersen-Jantzen-Soergel
              localization technique in  the comparison hyperalgebras.                 
              Quantum groups are a new area of research for both  mathematicians and
              physicists.  On the mathematical side, it  combines three of the oldest areas
              of "pure" mathematics,  algebra, analysis and geometry, yet it is of great
              interest to  physicists working on conformal quantum field theory.
