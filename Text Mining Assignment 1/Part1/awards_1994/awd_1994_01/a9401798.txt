Abstract    :
              9401798   Brown  Ohio State University requests support from NSF for the
              connection  of Ashland University to the Ohio Academic Resources Network 
              (OARnet) which is the NSF mid-level network that serves the State  of Ohio.  A
              primary goal of OARnet is to facilitate collaborative  projects and sharing of
              resources between institutions, including  those outside the state.    OARnet
              will provide operations management and information services  and it will give
              the six universities a 56 thousand bit per second  connection to the NSFNET, a
              high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per  second) National Backbone network.   
              The university needs greater functionality and network speed to be  able to
              access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers  along with being
              able to implement a more reliable mail system.  Students and faculty research
              will benefit from the link.  This is  also a unique opportunity for the schools
              to explore innovative  educational resources.
