Abstract    :
               The focus of the research is the design and evaluation of  hardware assets and
              software techniques to improve the  performance of the  memory hierarchy of
              high-performance  systems.    Processor speed has steadily  improved during the
              last decade  but memory latency and bandwith have been  progressing at a 
              slower pace.  Several techniques to reduce or tolerate high  memory latencies
              have recently surfaced.  Some of these  techniques are  evaluated using
              trace-driven and  instruction-level simulations of benchmarks.  A major thrust
              of the effort is to devise improvements  in the simulation  techniques, e.g.,
              by using selective  sampling and parellel discrete event  simulation, so that 
              performance results can be obtained faster.  The experiments  in  parallel
              simulation serve as a test bed to  customize programs for  parallel execution. 
                Additional projects continuing present reserch include  the  design of cache
              coherence protocols with various block sizes  for transfer  and coherence. 
              These protocols are geared  towards a reduction in contention in  the
              interconnect of  shared-memory multiprocessors and a decrease in the amount  of
              traffic caused by sharing.  Similar goals are the subject  of software 
              techniques such as compiler directives for  bypassing the cache and placement
              of  data in the right  levels of the memory hierchy.
