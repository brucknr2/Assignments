Abstract    :
              9401439  Roemmich    The deep water mass exchange between the South and North
              Pacific  through the Samoan passage will be quantified by conducting an 
              hydrographic line between Fiji and Tahiti across the Samoan passage  and the
              Pehring basin.  Water temperature, salinity, nutrients and  dissolved oxygen
              will be extracted from water samples collected  every 30 nautical miles.  This
              experiment is a component of the  one-time hydrographic survey of the World
              Ocean Circulation  Experiment (WOCE).
