Abstract    :
              9401851 Lepowsky  The principal investigators will investigate vertex operator 
              algebras and Lie algebras.  One will study the new concept of  vertex tensor
              category.  The other will construct a new type of  basis for the free Lie
              algebra and to study affinization of  certain simple Lie algebras of Cartan
              type in prime  characteristic. Together they will use vertex operator algebra 
              theory to study Z-algebras.  Conformal field theory is an important physical
              theory describing  both two-dimensional critical phenomena in condensed matter 
              physics and classical motions of strings in string theory.   Besides its
              importance in physics, the beautiful and rich  mathematical structure of
              conformal field theory also has  interested many mathematicians.  New relations
              between different  branches of mathematics, such as representations of 
              infinite-dimensional Lie algebras and groups, Riemann surfaces  and algebraic
              curves, the Monster sporadic group, modular  functions and modular forms,
              elliptic genera, and knot theory, is  revealed in the study of conformal field
              theory.
