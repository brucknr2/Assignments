Abstract    :
              This research aims to study the upper atmosphere using ground-based  optical
              measurements.  The areas of investigation are:  1)  measurements of upper
              thermosphere dynamics under geomagnetic  conditions ranging from quiet to
              disturbed, 2) extension of the  upper thermosphere wind and temperature field
              determinations to the  middle atmosphere region, 3) correlation of the neutral
              atmosphere  motion with those of the ionospheric plasma, and 4) comparisons of 
              the measured behaviors in all these cases with predictions of ab-  initio and
              empirical models.  The instruments used for the  observations include two
              Fabry-Perot Interferometers (FPIs) at  Millstone Hill and Laurel Ridge operated
              bi-statically, a new all-  sky Doppler interferometer at Laurel Ridge, and a
              fourth FPI at  Arequipa in Peru.  The measurements will be combined with models
              to  account for the observed behavior of neutral winds in the upper 
              atmosphere.
