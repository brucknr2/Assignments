Abstract    :
                    9414696  Taya  The research will explore the use of TiNi shape memory
              alloy fibers  and reinforcements in aluminum and epoxy matrix composites.  The 
              use of a shape memory alloy for a fiber reinforcement can result in  the
              production of compressive residual stresses in the matrix phase  of the
              composite.  This can result in increases in flow stress and  toughness of the
              composite as compared to these properties in the  same composites when the TiNi
              was not treated to produce a shape  memory effect in the composite.  The
              induced compressive stress in  the matrix as a result of the shape memory alloy
              treatment of TiNi  is responsible for the enhancement of the tensile properties
              and  toughness of the composite.  The concept of enhancing the  mechanical
              properties of composites by inducing desirable stress  states via shape memory
              reinforcements is innovative and the  research is well worth support.  ***
