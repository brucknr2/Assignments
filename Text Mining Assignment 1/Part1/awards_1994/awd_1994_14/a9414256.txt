Abstract    :
              9414256  Krogh       The 11th International Conference on Analysis and 
              Optimization of Systems organized by INRIA will be the second  specialized
              conference of the series.  This time, the specific  field covered will be
              discrete event systems (DES).  It can be  considered also s the second
              WODES/CODES conference (series of  Conferences on discrete event systems).     
               This conference is aimed at engineers and mathematicians  working in the field
              of Automatic Control, Operations Research  and Statistics who are interested by
              the modeling, analysis and  optimization of discrete event systems.  Many
              formalisms have  been developed to describe such systems.  The comparison of
              the  different mathematical approaches and the global confrontation of  the
              mathematical approaches with the applications are the main  goals of the
              conference.  ***
