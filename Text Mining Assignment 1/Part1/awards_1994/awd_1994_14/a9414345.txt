Abstract    :
              9414345  Jayasuriya  In this research project, a frequency domain design
              methodology  is developed for the synthesis of controllers for highly 
              uncertain systems to insure robust stability, for assuring non-  overshooting
              step responses and other time-domain specifications,  and for maximizing the
              tolerance to external disturbances. In  addition, a new control theory is
              formulated for eliminating  critical speed vibrations and other rotodynamic
              instabilities in  high speed rotors by utilizing actively controlled magnetic 
              bearings. The control methodology is applicable to multivariable  uncertain
              plants with more actuators than controlled out puts and  to linear time-varying
              and nonlinear compensation for the  elimination of limitations brought about by
              the presence of non-  minimum phase zeros.  ***
