Abstract    :
                    9414756  Cooper  This research will explore the mechanical and
              thermomechanical  behavior of thick-film oxide - thin film synthetic fluoromica
               laminates at elevated temperatures.  The research directly  addresses
              questions of thermodynamic stability of reinforced  engineering ceramics,
              direct evaluation of fiber-matrix interfacial  functionality as functions of
              temperature and strain rate and  capabilities of fabrication.  While the
              proposed research involves  fundamentals emphasizing mechanical analysis of
              engineered  laminates and solid state reaction studies, these issues also 
              directly address the performance and processing of continuous  fiber-ceramic
              composites that employ trioctahedral fluoromicas as  the functional interphase
              separating fiber and matrix.  The results  of this research will be directly
              applied to improve properties of  present engineering ceramics and to
              development work on alumina  fiber reinforced glass ceramics.  ***
