Abstract    :
              9414840  Mihaly  This award supports Professor Laszlo Mihaly and a graduate 
              student of the State University of New York (SUNY) at Stony  Brook, joined by
              Dr. Gwyn Williams of Brookhaven National  Laboratory, to collaborate in solid
              state physics with  Professor Laszlo Forro of the Ecole Polytechnique Federale
              de  Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland.  They will explore electron  states in
              selected superconducting materials by measuring the  optical conductivity from
              the far infrared to the visible  range.  The participants bring to the
              collaboration a unique  combination of facilities and expertise for the study
              of the  infrared transmission properties of thin crystalline films.  In 
              particular, Dr. Forro at EPFL has developed a special sample  preparation
              method for extremely thin single crystals which  permits optical analyses of a
              variety of anisotropic materials.  He will investigate the magnetic and
              electronic transport  properties of the samples.  Most of the optical
              spectroscopy  work will be carried out at Stony Brook, while low frequency 
              infrared measurements will be made at the National Synchrotron  Light source at
              Brookhaven National Laboratory.    Superconductivity, spin density waves and
              charge density waves  are all manifestations of electron correlations.  While
              the  interaction between the electrons and the nature of the  electronic ground
              state are profoundly different for these  three phenomena, there are also
              important similarities among  them.  This U.S.-Swiss collaborative research
              will  experimentally analyze three model materials each of which  exhibits one
              of these phenomena, in order to improve  understanding of the electron
              correlations which cause these  interesting and potentially useful phenomena. 
              The results  should be of particular interest to condensed matter physicists 
              working in the area of high temperature superconductivity.  ***
