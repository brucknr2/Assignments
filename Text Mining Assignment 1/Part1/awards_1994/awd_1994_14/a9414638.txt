Abstract    :
              This project provides supports the Fifth International Conference  on Hydrogen
              Effects on Material Behavior, scheduled in September  1994 at Jackson, Wyoming.
               The only conferences in the United  States devoted solely to hydrogen
              embrittlement over the last  twenty years have been the preceding conferences
              in this series  in 1973, 1975, 1980 and 1989.  Earliest conferences
              concentrated  on new hydrogen phenomena and efforts to test existing 
              hypothesized mechanisms of embrittlement.  Recent conferences  have focused on
              mechanisms of behavior, refinements of  experimental approaches, and needs for
              future research to further  understanding.  The intent of this conference to
              provide a clear  statement of progress in understanding problems of hydrogen, 
              including those related to intermetallic alloys and other new  materials; to
              evaluate the prospects for corrective or preventive  approaches for hydrogen
              damage and/or embrittlement; and to  identify needs for future research.  This
              conference series has  clearly demonstrated the effectiveness of interaction
              among  university, industry, and government laboratory scientists and 
              engineers in addressing these problems and creating a stimulating  forum.   
              Materials specialists and designers are concerned with respect to  the behavior
              of new materials in environments containing sources  of hydrogen.
