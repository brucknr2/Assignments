Abstract    :
              9414748  Shibata    This proposal supports the collaboration of Dr. Edward
              Shibata of Purdue University and Dr. Seigi Iwata of Japan's National Laboratory
              for High Energy Physics (KEK).  Project funding will enable Dr. Shibata to
              spend one year in Japan, resident at KEK, in order to conduct research in the
              TOPAZ experiment at the TRISTAN collider at KEK with Dr. Iwata and other U.S.
              and Japanese physicists.  Dr. Shibata will collaborate in two KEK experimental
              high energy physics programs that will complement his U.S. research program on
              the CLEO experiment at Cornell University.  After he returns to the U.S., Dr.
              Shibata will use his experience gained in Japan for development and
              constructions work on the recently approved upgrade of the CLEO II detector to
              CLEO III.    This proposal brings together research scientists from two
              countries working in the area of high energy physics.  The U.S. scientist will
              have the opportunity to become familiar with research techniques, equipment,
              and facilities at KEK as well as contribute to the overall research effort. 
              Therefore, this proposal fulfills the objectives of the Program in its exchange
              and transfer of scientific knowledge through an international collaboration.
