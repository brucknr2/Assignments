Abstract    :
              9414306  Weidner      The PI will organize and run a topical workshop to discuss
              and refine current earth models based on present data from geodynamics, mineral
              physics, and seismology.  The workshop will involve participation of interested
              researchers from all three communities, and will focus on the criteria needed
              for a satisfactory model, assessment of the real constraints provided by
              seismic and mineral physics data, and the extent to which such a model should
              incorporate lateral heterogeneity.  It is anticipated that the conference will
              result in the formation of several working groups that may prepare CSEDI
              collaborative research proposals for NSF.  ****
