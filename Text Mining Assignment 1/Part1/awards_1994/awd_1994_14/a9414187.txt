Abstract    :
              The growth in size and complexity of modern computers is matched by  the need
              for more accurate models of their internal wiring  structure.  The task of
              modeling this complexity is ideally suited  to a recent development in
              statistical physics called the re-  normalization group.  It has the power to
              attack the wiring  optimization problem because it takes this one very
              difficult  problem and breaks it up into a very large number of much simpler 
              problems.  Rather than attempting to attack the entire range of  partitioning
              and placement requirements from the transistor level  to the back-plane, an
              optimization procedure need only be found for  a highly restricted wire length
              range.  Once this has been derived,  the procedure is renormalized for all
              other length scales in a  manner which generates a system-wide solution.  This
              project will  investigate how such an approach may be used to develop much
              better  estimates of interconnect-limited system performance and how this 
              theory leads to new optimization algorithms.  In contrast to other  theories 
              the predictions made by this technique will grow ever  more accurate as the
              systems grow larger and more complex.
