Abstract    :
              9414020  Berman       The research represents an effort to study ways in which 
              transient spectroscopy can be used to probe the dynamics of cold  atoms in
              collision.  Steady state techniques have already  revealed that several time
              scales are important in the dynamics  of cold vapors and the current proposal
              will enable a better  understanding of the underlying physical processes at
              work.  Atom  interferometry will also be investigated as well as the collision 
              induced phase changes in optical dipoles.  ***
