Abstract    :
              9414259  Milne         A major focus of the third phase of AEROCE is to improve
              the  understanding of the chemical processes occurring as polluted air  masses
              move off the eastern North American continent.  The presence  of non-methane
              hydrocarbons (NHMCs) in these air masses, together  with the oxides of nitrogen
              (NOx), leads to the photochemical  production or destruction of ozone.  Ozone
              is a radiatively  important trace gas which has both biological and human
              health  impacts.  Together with the hydroxyl radical, OH, ozone is a key 
              factor in regulating the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere, i.e.  the
              processes whereby anthropogenic emissions, including NMHCs, are  broken down
              and removed from the gas phase.         As part of the AEROCE program, this
              will initiate measurements  of speciated (C2 - C10) NMHCs in the marine
              atmosphere at several of  the AEROCE field sites.  The proposed field
              measurements will  provide an integrated measurement setting with which to
              further  understanding of the chemical climatology of NMHCs and  photochemical
              oxidants in the North Atlantic troposphere.
