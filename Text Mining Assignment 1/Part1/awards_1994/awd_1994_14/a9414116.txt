              Abstract  ATM-9414116  Bierly, Eugene W.  American Geophysical Union  Title:
              Support for U.S. National Office for Earth Systems History  (ESH)    This award
              supports the management infrastructure for the  coordination of U.S. research
              activities in connection with the  Earth System History (ESH) Initiative of the
              United States Global  Change Research Program (USGCRP).  The EHS Office at the
              American  Geophysical Union (AGU) will provide the secretariat for the ESH 
              Steering Committee and a point of contact for interaction with the 
              international effort in Past Global Changes (PAGES) of the  International
              Geosphere Biosphere Programme (IGBP).  The initial  effort will be a workshop
              designed to obtain paleoclimate community  input regarding the goals and
              priorities of the Abrupt Climate  Change effort.  Subsequent workshops and
              meetings will be held to  insure that implementation of the program is carried
              out and that  the goals of the program are met to the objectives.
