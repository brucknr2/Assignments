Abstract    :
              During this three-year program, the atmospheric chemistry of  selected organic
              compounds emitted into the atmosphte from  vegetation will be experimentally
              investigated.  On regional and  global scales, the emissions of non-methane
              organic compounds from  vegetation will be expermentally investigated.  On
              regional and  global scales, the emissions of non-methane organic compounds
              from  vegetation, which are largely comprised of isoprene (2-methyl-1,3- 
              butadiene and C10H16 monoterpenes, are comparable to or exceed the  emissions
              of non-methane organic compounds from anthropogenic  sources.  The chemistry of
              the planetary boundary layer may well be  dominated by these biogenic
              emissions.  Additionally, the emissions  of isoprene and monoterpenes from
              vegetation have been implicated  in the formation of ozone and other
              manifestations of photochemical  air pollutiion in rural and urban areas.  Sine
              the rate constants  fro the atmosphereically-important gas-phase reactions of
              isoprene  and the monoterpenes with hydrozyl (NO3) radicals and ozone (O3) are 
              now reliably known, this project will focus on the products formed  from the OH
              radical, NO3 radical and O3 reactions with these  biogenic organic compounds
              and the elecidation of the reaction  mechanisms.    Experiments to identify and
              quantify the products of the gas-phase  reactions of OH radicals, NO3 radicals
              and O
