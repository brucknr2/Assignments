Abstract    :
               NSF support will be used to renovate the non-metallic materials laboratory
              facilities in Rogers Hall at Polytechnic University.  Constructed in 1923, the
              space was last renovated in the mid 1950s, and the laboratories are ill-suited
              to the multi-million dollar research and research training program in polymeric
              materials, non-polymer materials and materials characterization.  The materials
              research program involves faculty from the School of Chemical and Material
              Science (including the departments of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering,
              Materials Science and Engineering and the Herman F. Mark Polymer Research
              Institute) and the Physics department.   The multi-disciplinary nature of the
              research activity requires a well-designed physical layout of the laboratories.
               The funded renovation effort will reconfigure the laboratory space into an
              efficient arrangement and will allow for the consolidation of major research
              instrumentation and facilities. Material Characterization will be greatly
              improved by the consolidation and centralization of the X-ray laboratory, SEM,
              STEM, laser facilities, scanning tunneling microscope, light scattering
              facilities and spectroscopy facilities. In addition, all space will be
              substantially improved with the installation of a new HVAC system, new windows,
              and new fume hoods.
