Abstract    :
              Lynn, David  Recent advances at the interface between physical, inorganic, and
              organic  chemistry and the biological sciences have been dramatic. Stimulated
              by the exciting  scientific possibilities for the future, the Chemistry
              Department at the University of  Chicago plans to increase its strength in this
              interfacial area.  In order to do so, the  department has coordinated plans for
              stronger intellectual ties with both the Biological  Sciences and Physical
              Sciences Divisions. Crucial to the fulfillment of these plans is  the
              renovation of the fourth floor of George Herbert Jones Chemical Laboratory 
              which served as the principal chemical research building on campus from its 
              construction in 1928 until the completion of adjacent Searle Chemistry Building
              in  1968.    The $1.7 million project to renovate the fourth floor of Jones
              Hall and a cold  room in Searle Hall will be supported equally by NSF and the
              University of Chicago  with an investment of $850,000 each.  Renovation
              activities will correct current space  deficiencies which include the lack of
              air conditioning and adequate heating, and old  and unsafe electrical and
              plumbing systems.  These problems create research facilities  which are poorly
              controlled and unreliable in air/humidity regulation and cause the  loss of
              important research organisms.  Fume hoods which are far below the minimum 
              safety requirements will also be replaced.    The renovated space is key to
              chemists, bio-physical chemists, and organic chemists.  Beneficiaries include 6
              faculty directly and another 12 indirectly.  In addition, 46  graduate students
              and 19 postdoctoral students will be working in the renovated space.   The
              program emphasizes participation by women and minorities and is proactive in 
              the recruitment of new faculty and students in further development of the new 
              interdisciplinary biological chemistry program.
