Abstract    :
                Byrne:    Richard Stockton College of New Jersey is one of only two 4-year
              undergraduate institutions  located in Southern New Jersey.  The institution is
              one of the few undergraduate institutions  in the United States with a degree
              program in Marine Science, serving approximately 100  degree majors.  To
              sustain this growth, the college plans to renovated and modernize the  marine
              laboratory on Nactoe Creek, a part of the intercoastal lagoon system in
              southern New  Jersey.  Present conditions at the facility are inadequate and
              severely limit research activities.   Space dedicated to research and research
              training is not properly partitioned and does not  meet safety requirements. 
              No seawater system exists and the greenhouse facility in its  present state is
              unusable.  The heating and cooling systems are antiquated and cannot support 
              the level of use in the building.  Funds have been requested to renovate 1,678
              square feet  (156.1 square meters) of research and research training space.  In
              addition to modernizing  space, renovations will include:  the installation of
              fume hoods, casework, emergency  eyewash showers and a seawater system.  HVAC
              and fire protection systems will be  upgraded and the greenhouse will be
              reglazed.  Once completed, the renovated facilities will  support research
              projects that cannot be conducted at the moment.  Redesigned space will 
              promote more collaborative activities with other institutions in proximity to
              the marine field  station and will allow for more student involvement. 
              Opportunities for students to engage in  the research enterprise early in their
              undergraduate careers will increase the probability that  the students will
              continue in their pursuit of marine science.
