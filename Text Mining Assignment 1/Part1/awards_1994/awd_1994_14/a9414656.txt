Abstract    :
              9414656  Sosa    This award supports a three-month research  visit by Professor
              Horacio Sosa, Drexel  University, to Tohoku University, Sendai,  Japan, where
              he will work with Professor  Yasuhide Shindo in the Department of Materials 
              Processing.  The research project will focus on  the mechanical behavior of
              non-traditional  materials such as superconductors,  piezoelectric ceramics,
              shape memory alloys,  and fiber optics.  Applications of these  materials are
              found in ground and aerial  vehicles, telecommunications, electronic 
              packaging, and medical instrumentation.    This research visit will promote
              collaborative  work among U.S. and Japanese researchers  interested in
              narrowing the gap that exists  among theory, experiment, and actual design and 
              fabrication of devices and structures.  The  laboratory at Tohoku University is
              widely  recognized for work on the mechanical behavior  of materials subjected
              to strong magnetic and  electric fields.  In addition to working at  Tohoku,
              the PI will visit Japanese industries,  technical institutes, and research 
              universities.  The visit is expected to promote  not only further U.S.-Japan
              collaboration, but  interaction with researchers in other  countries.  ***
