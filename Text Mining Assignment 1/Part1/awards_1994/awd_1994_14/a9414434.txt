Abstract    :
              9414434  Narayan  Pulsed laser and ion-assisted pulsed laser deposition
              techniques  will be developed to deposit coatings of hydrogen-free  diamondlike
              carbon, cubic boron nitride, and carbon nitride on  52100 steel, silicon, and
              intermetallic compounds.  The films  will be fully characterized by various
              surface analysis  techniques and by TEM, and their hardness, adhesion, and 
              tribological properties will be determined  ***
