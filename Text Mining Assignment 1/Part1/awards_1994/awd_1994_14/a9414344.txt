Abstract    :
              9414344  Saleur  A modest amount of funding is requested to help organize a 
              conference called "Statistical Mechanics and Quantum Field  Theory, to be held
              at USC from May 16th - 22nd, 1994.  There are  two primary purpose for this
              conference.  The first is to bring  together leading researchers at the
              interface between statistical  mechanics and quantum field theory, which has
              become an extremely  active interdisciplinary area.  The second is to expose
              young  researchers to the diversity of this active research.  ***
