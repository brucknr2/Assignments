              Abstract  ATM-9414733  Baker, Paul A.  Duke University  Title: SGER:
              Paleoclimatic Research in Lake Titicaca    This award is in support of a Small
              Grant for Exploratory Research  (SGER).  Lake Titicaca (Peru/Bolivia) may
              contain the most  important sedimentary record of Quaternary climatic change in
               tropical South America.  Previous paleoclimatic studies in the lake  have only
              involved analysis of shallow-water cores.  This is  because the recovery of
              sediments from central, portions of the  lake is a major undertaking, involving
              a sufficiently large vessel  for the rough sea conditions of the lake. 
              Extensive seismic  reflection profiling should also be done as part of this
              study as  an aid to core site selection and as a means for identification of 
              hiatuses and sedimentary facies.  Prior to requesting funds for a  major
              expedition to Lake Titicaca, it is appropriate and prudent to  make personal
              contact with government officials and scientists in  Peru and Bolivia to ensure
              the success of future research efforts.   This award supports travel to Peru
              and Bolivia in order to: (1)  contact government officials to obtain assurances
              that research  cruises will be approved; (2) communicate personally with South 
              American scientific colleagues to ensure that they will be properly  involved
              in this research; and (3) determine the availability of  technical facilities
              and supplies.
