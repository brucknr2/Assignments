Abstract    :
              9414088  Farell  The project will study the effects of turbulence and its 
              scales on the flow and the pressure loading on simple  building models, in
              particular, the effect of the length  scales of turbulence in relation to the
              size of the model.  The effect of large scale and transverse velocity 
              fluctuations, fluctuations in the inertial subrange of the  spectrum and of
              scales distortions will be part of the work.  Several boundary layer
              simulations will be produced in both  tunnel test sections by using different
              vortex generator and  barrier heights for each roughness configuration
              selected.  The effects of small scale  turbulence will be studied by  using
              spires, grids and jets to change the small-scale  spectral energy content while
              keeping the low frequency  spectral energy essentially unaltered.  The results
              from  this project will help clear some of the confusion in  statements,
              results and correlations between wind tunnel and  full-scale data especially in
              regard to the effect of large  and small scale fluctuations on the fluctuating
              pressures on  a bluff body, in particular under vortex structures formed  off
              the body surfaces.  ***
