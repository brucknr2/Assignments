Abstract    :
              9414629  Tan  This project deals with the dynamic modeling of coupled 
              crankshaft-belt drive system used in automobile power  transmission, their
              vibration ad stability analysis, and a  development of computational algorithm
              for design. The analysis  uses the Hamiltonian principle, local linearization,
              and a  distributed transfer function approach. The results of this  research
              lead to a better understanding of fundamental response  characteristics, and
              improved design guidelines for optimization  of front end accessory drive
              system of an automobile. The design  guidelines are also useful for other
              high-speed, axially moving  mechanical systems. Ford Motor Company is providing
              partial  matching three-year support for this research project.  ***
