Abstract    :
              9414083  Bai  This project develops a new and unified econometric theory for 
              the testing and estimation of multiple structural changes in a  variety of
              econometric models where changes in the parameters of  the model occur at
              unknown times.  Recent developments in  economic theory as well as in empirical
              applications have shown  the need for an econometric theory of multiple
              structural  changes.  Although the case of a single structural change has 
              received considerable attention, research on the subject of  multiple
              structural changes is scant.  The goal of this research  is to develop on a
              coherent basis the econometric theory of  multiple structural changes by
              extending previous work of the  principle investigator in this area.        
              This project answers a number of questions pertaining to  multiple structural
              changes.  Among the issues addressed are:  1)   Determination of the changes of
              regimes (periods during       which the parameters of a model do not change) in
              a given       data set;  2)   Testing the hypothesis of no structural shift
              versus that of       multiple structural shifts, And, more generally, testing k
                    shifts versus k+l shifts;  3)   Determination of critical values and
              construction of       standard reference tables;  4)   Estimation of models
              with multiple structural changes and       determination of the criteria for
              estimating the shift       points;  5)   Solving the computational problem for
              multiple-shift       estimation; and  6)   Deriving the statistical properties
              of the resulting       estimators and the estimated shift points.
