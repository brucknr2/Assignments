Abstract    :
              9414385  Srienc  This project is on research to study the dynamics of eukaryotic
               cell populations at the single cell level using Saccharomyces  cerevisiae and
              murine hybridomas as eukaryotic model systems.   Flow cytometry techniques have
              been developed which permit  experimental determination of the rate,
              transition, and  partitioning functions for balanced growth conditions.  These 
              fundamental physiological functions, in combination with  population balance
              equations, rigorously describe the growth  dynamics of cell populations.  This
              approach will now be extended  to evaluate how these functions depend on
              environmental growth  parameters, such as concentrations of specific nutrients,
              with  the aim to better understand transient growth situations in a 
              bioreactor.  Also, this project will focus on experimental  determination of
              the relationship between single-cell growth  rates and single-cell rates of
              nutrient consumption and product  formation.  ***
