Abstract    :
                   The investigator mentors undergraduate students in a range of research
              activities, including the preparation and presentation of papers at
              professional meetings.  Specific topics include theoretical and applied aspects
              of wavelets, number theory, image processing, graph theory, coding theory, and
              minimal surfaces.       Technical training and education of all parts of the
              country's population is essential for the nation's success in an increasingly
              technological world.  This project focuses on mentoring and training activities
              of women undergraduates.  It continues in a more formal way the investigator's
              successful practices in training students and preparing them for careers in
              areas related to the mathematical sciences.
