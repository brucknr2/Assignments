Abstract    :
               NSF and the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee will jointly fund the renovation
              of a portion of Lapham Hall for research and research training in Conservation
              Biology.  The research integrates both theoretical and applied aspects of
              ecology, evolution, systematics and ecosystems research.  The program stresses
              a solid foundation in conceptual approaches and extensive experiences in
              laboratory and field methods.  The current laboratory space, originally
              constructed in 1959-1960 as a teaching facility, has limited the program's
              ability to conduct experimental research activities.      With the support of
              NSF, the researchers will rectify serious environmental problems in the
              aquarium facility including the upgrade of the dechlorination system, improved
              water temperature control, installation of controlled lighting, and provision
              of adequate ventilation.  In addition, award monies will be utilized to install
              three new growth chambers and renovate a fourth.  Three of the existing units
              are 28 years old and deteriorated beyond repair.  Emergency power will be
              supplied to both the aquarium room and the growth chambers as part of the
              renovation effort.
