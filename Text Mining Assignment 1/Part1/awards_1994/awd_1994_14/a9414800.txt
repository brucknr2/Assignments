Abstract    :
              9414800  Nolte  The objective of the proposed research is to create holographic 
              materials from photorefractive quantum wells.  The key breakthrough 
              anticipated is the development of photorefractive quantum wells  into
              asymmetric Fabry-Perot structures.  These multi-wave  interference devices will
              have the maximum performance possible for  photorefractive quantum well
              technology, and will make these  devices available for new femtosecond spectral
              holography  applications that require high-sensitivity and high-speed 
              holographic materials for use in lightwave fiber communications  systems.  In
              addition, several new designs will be demonstrated  that have unique
              photorefractive features, such as monolithic all-  semiconductor quantum well
              devices that considerably ease  fabrication requirements, the search for
              stimulated backscattering  in reflection-geometry devices that may achieve net
              gain for  applications requiring optical amplification and selfpumped phase- 
              conjugation, and fast free-carrier photorefractive devices for use  with pulsed
              light sources.  ***
