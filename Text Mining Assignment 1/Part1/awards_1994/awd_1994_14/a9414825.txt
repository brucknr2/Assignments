Abstract    :
              This award will provide funding for the renovation of biology research and
              research training  laboratories on the campus of La Sierra University.  The
              Department of Biology is housed in  Palmer Hall, a 41 year old structure that
              has never been renovated.  Current research facilities are  inadequate to
              support research and research training activities conducted by faculty and
              students.   Poor environmental control in rooms often jeopardizes the integrity
              of experiments, and the lack  of ample electrical service overloads circuits. 
              Because the building has never been remodeled,  much of the facility does not
              meet electrical and plumbing codes.  The plumbing system does not  have
              backflow protection and many of the research laboratories are not equipped for
              the delivery  of distilled water.  Installation of fixed equipment such as fume
              hoods and reinforced cabinets,  provide for the capability of storing hazardous
              chemicals, mandated for a safe working  atmosphere.  Improvements to air
              quality and climate control will enhance the ability to do  research in a
              controlled environment and will eliminate much loss of time and experiments due
               to contamination.  In addition to providing a better and safer area for
              faculty to pursue their  research, upgrading of these facilities will increase
              the number of students, giving them more  access to research training.
