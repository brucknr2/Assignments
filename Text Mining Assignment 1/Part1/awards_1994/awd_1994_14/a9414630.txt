Abstract    :
              9414630  O'Cinneide       Computational probability is an area of study that
              focuses on  the application of non-randomized algorithms for analyzing systems 
              that are subject to randomness.  Computational probability is a  manifestation
              of the incorporation of computers into society at  large, and into science and
              engineering in particular.  This  research is concerned with the problems of
              computational  probability, including the methods of phases, decomposition 
              methods, and asymptotic methods.  Some fundamental questions  regarding the
              scope of the method of phases will be investigated.   Decomposition method will
              be combined with the method of phases in  an attempt to devise a
              method-of-phases approach to a large  systems.  A central theme of the research
              is to bring numerical  analysis to bear on computational probability.  In
              particular, the  relationship between non-negative arithmetic and the accuracy
              of  certain algorithms in computational probability will be explored.       The
              theoretical aspect of this research will have some impact  on applications
              through the identification of good algorithms and  methodologies for solving
              problems that have some inherent  attributes of randomness.  On the application
              side, the work  undertaken in this research can be viewed as part of the
              process of  incorporating the use of computers into the design of complex 
              systems.
