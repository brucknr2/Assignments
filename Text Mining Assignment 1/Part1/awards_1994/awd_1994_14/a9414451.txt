Abstract    :
                ABSTRACT  OPP-9414451  ACKERMAN    This archaeological, geological and
              paleoecological survey will focus on an area of limestone caves with excellent
              preservation conditions which were recently discovered in the Lime Hills region
              of Southwestern Alaska. Preliminary sampling of one cave entrance has suggested
              two major intervals. An upper level contained artifacts of bone, antler and
              stone with a bottom date of 9500 BP, and can be associated with the Paleoarctic
              tradition of Western Alaska or the Denali Complex of Central Alaska. The lower
              level, with only faunal remains found thus far, dates to the Late Pleistocene
              (13,000 - 15,000 BP). This project will recover artifactual and ecological data
              from these two stratigraphic divisions to determine the sequence of human
              occupations during the Holocene and late Pleistocene. Additional efforts will
              be directed towards sampling other caves and sinkholes as well as the coring of
              nearby bogs and lakes. The goal of the project is to determine the antiquity of
              human presence in the region and to collect data that will provide insights
              into the environmental conditions of those times.  ***  ??
