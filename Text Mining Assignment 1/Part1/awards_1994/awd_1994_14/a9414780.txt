Abstract    :
              9414780  Garg         As man-made systems such as automated factories, 
              communication networks, and computers continue to grow in size,  "cut and try"
              approaches to design and supervision become less  realistic.  What is needed
              instead are controller synthesis  techniques that allow optimal control laws to
              be derived  mathematically and with performance properties that can be 
              verified automatically.  A well-established framework exists for  control of
              systems without explicit real-time constraints.   However, if timing is of
              concern in the system dynamics and its  performance specification then the
              situation becomes much more  complex.         Certain real-time discrete event
              systems can be described by  linear equations in a non-traditional algebraic
              system called  max-algebra.  For these systems, the problem of supervisory 
              control is to impose delays on the execution of selected events  to achieve
              some specified performance goal.  The objective of the  proposed research is to
              examine the existence and synthesis of  controllers for DES which include such
              time constraints.  Our  method relies on the max-algebra model for timed DES
              which  permits control theory results for untimed DES to be related to  timed
              systems.  ***
