Abstract    :
              Utilizing  funds  from  the  Academic  Research  Infrastructure  Program 
              microscopy instrumentation will be acquired to augment  the   ongoing  
              interdisciplinary  research  at  Old   Dominion  University.   The  
              instrumentation   includes    a    FT-Raman  spectrometer,  a  Ramanscope
              microscope, an  Fourier  transform  infrared (FTIR) microscope, and an Atomic
              Force Microscope base  and  scan  heads. The instrumentation will shared 
              between  the  Departments of Chemistry, Electrical Engineering and Mechanical 
              Engineering and will be utilized for research in the  following  areas:  Raman 
              characterization of  high-performance  thermoset  polymers;  vibrational
              studies of mixed metal oxide  catalysts;  synthesis  and characterization of
              thin diamond films;  surface  characterization   of  corrosion  and  dealloying
                mechanisms;  surface  characterization  of  the  initial  stages  of  porous 
              silicon formation.    Instrumentation   in the microscopy area will be 
              acquired  for  studies of thermoset polymers, metal oxide catalysts, synthesis 
              and  characterization  of  thin diamond  films,  the  study  of  corrosion and
              dealloying mechanisms, and studies of the initial  stages of porous silicon
              formation.
