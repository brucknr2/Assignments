Abstract    :
              9414680  Sen       This research addresses the problem of multi-stage decision 
              making with uncertainty in a long-range planning process,  especially those
              that are typically undertaken by industry in  planning for the entire life
              cycle of a product.  The work is aimed  at developing some algorithms to extend
              earlier work in stochastic  decomposition models for two stage problems.  This
              research extends  the two-stage problem to a problem involving more than two
              stages.   Stochastic decomposition SD uses randomly generated observations 
              within Benders, decomposition of a two stage stochastic linear  program to
              identify an optimal solution (asymptotically).       Many key decisions aimed
              at improving a company's global  competitiveness involve the integration of
              several aspects planning  and design.  The techniques developed as part of this
              research will  provide the tools necessary to integrate several decision
              elements  of a company in designing high quality and long lasting products 
              while at the same time keeping cost down.  In this respect, the  developments
              from this research can find applications in such areas  as concurrent
              engineering, total quality management, and production  planning and control. 
              Furthermore, the results from the research  could provide some insight to help
              bridge the gap between  stochastic and deterministic Operations Research.
