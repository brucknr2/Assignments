Abstract    :
              An inter-comparison exercise, the colloid will be conducted,  wherein multiple
              sampling systems for separating marine colloidal  matter are tested.  The
              primary goal of this exercise is to  determine if the colloidal material being
              collected is chemically  similar amongst the different filtration devices which
              are  presently used in oceanography.  It is deemed necessary to sample  both a
              particle/colloid rich, high DOC coastal site and a low  colloid and low DOC end
              member to compare the operational  differences amongst each sampling system. 
              Particular attention  will be paid to internal blanks and sorptive losses, as
              well as  artifacts which can arise from differences in operating conditions.
