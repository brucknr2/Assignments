Abstract    :
              Funding from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program will enable Mount
              Saint Mary's College, an  institution primarily for women, located in the
              Southern California area, to renovate key areas of  the science building
              dedicated to research and research training activities.  The renovation plan 
              targets specific areas in Biology and the Physical Sciences where
              investigations in microbiology, cell  biology, immunology and neuroscience
              occur.  Funds will be used to update electrical and plumbing  systems,
              increasing the safety and accommodation of increased equipment utilization. 
              Selected  laboratories will be reconfigured to provide more efficient space for
              faculty and students as they  conduct various experiments.  Fixed equipment
              consisting of fume hoods, casework, benches and storage  cabinets will be
              installed in the renovated spaces. The project will improve the quality of the 
              research space as well as the total educational and research experience.  It is
              anticipated that  because the institution has the highest percentage of
              minority students among the independent colleges  in California, more minority
              women will matriculate in the sciences, having the opportunity to  contribute
              to the scientific enterprise of the nation.
