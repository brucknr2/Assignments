Abstract    :
              9414149  Laugesen       This work concerns methods for estimating physical
              constants  related to domains in space.  For most domains, the constants,  such
              as electrostatic capacity, are impossible to compute.   However, symmetry
              methods such as those employed in this research  seek to determine the shape of
              domains where the extremal values  must occur.  The problem then shifts to one
              of computing the  constant for the extremal domain - which often can be done 
              explicitly.  Work on this project focuses on three groups of  problems.  The
              first is to show that for a set in n-dimensional  space with a fixed moment of
              inertia, the Newtonian capacity is  minimal when the set is a ball.  The
              analogous results for  logarithmic capacity and for the moment of inertia in
              dimension  equal to two has been established.  The second isoperimetric 
              problem considered is that of minimizing the ratio of logarithmic  to
              hyperbolic capacity for a continuum in a disc which lies in a  fixed concentric
              subdisc.  A solution to this problem would give  an upper estimate for
              hyperbolic capacity in terms of  easier-to-compute logarithmic capacity.  The
              third group of  problems concerns harmonic mappings of a disc to itself.  It is
               believed that, when suitably normalized, the coefficients of  power series
              expansions of components of such mappings have sharp  bounds.  Though the first
              unnormalized coefficient is believed  to be less than 5/2, the only estimate
              know so far is greater  than 55.         Classical function theory has
              introduced geometric  techniques which have proved to have far wider
              applicability than  first imagined.  In this project, the methods of 
              symmetrization, variational techniques and geometric reasoning  lead to results
              of valuable physical significance.  ***
