Abstract    :
              Members of the Department of Geological Sciences at California State University,
              Long Beach  (CSULB) investigate the interactions among the lithosphere,
              hydrosphere, biosphere and  atmosphere.  Researchers are now focusing on the
              geological aspects of environmental  contamination, determining how 
              hydrocarbons are generated and degraded in the lithosphere  and the marine
              environment.  Successful research is dependent upon quality laboratories that
              the  department currently does not possess.  Research space, housed in Peterson
              Halls 2 and 3, was  designed and built in the 1950's and early 1960's and is
              not conducive to support modern  research and research training.  Sharing of
              research space with teaching space, coupled with  faculty and students having
              access to only five fume hoods, creates severe problems with  contamination by
              particulate matter, that impedes research and research training activities. 
              This award will provide support for the consolidation of dispersed research
              laboratories into one  modern laboratory facility, providing adequate exhaust
              hood ventilation, air purification, and  instrumentation space for all faculty
              and students involved in geochemical research.   Geochemical analysis now
              conducted at a nearby institution will be shifted to CSULB, further  enhancing
              the ability of the Department to attract quality graduate students.  The
              renovation will  rectify deficiencies in the current laboratories, allowing
              research to be performed in an efficient  and clean environment, enabling the
              development of new research techniques, and fostering  interaction between
              research groups.  The new laboratory will be the first step in developing a 
              formal interdisciplinary program in the environmental sciences.
