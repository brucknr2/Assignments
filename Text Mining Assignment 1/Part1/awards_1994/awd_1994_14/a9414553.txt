Abstract    :
              Recent technological advances have now made it possible to directly manipulate
              the mammalian genome and observe the effects of these experimental
              manipulations on the development of the nervous system.  These advances include
              site-directed mutagenesis, positional cloning, and the analysis of the sequence
              and expression of genes.  The mouse has become the mammalian model animal of
              choice in experiments of this kind and this workshop is designed to bring
              together investigators and students using this model system.  The Jackson
              Laboratory, a renowned center for genetic research, which will be the site of
              the workshop, will provide a unique, "hands-on",  learning environment.  The
              organization of the workshop will offer the opportunity for the participants to
              engage in discussions concerning the latest technologies, their own work using
              these methods, and the potential impact of mouse neurogenetics on the field of
              Developmental Neuroscience.
