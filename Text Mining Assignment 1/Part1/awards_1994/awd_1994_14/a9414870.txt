Abstract    :
               Constructed almost seventy years ago and last renovated more than 40 years
              later, Chandler Laboratories on the Columbia University campus will undergo
              significant renovation with the support of NSF.  The project will renew the
              obsolete heating, ventilation/exhaust, electrical distribution, plumbing and
              fire protection systems and renovate research laboratories in the oldest
              research wing of the Chemical Science Center.  The facilities currently house
              the research activity of eight faculty whose work examines synthesis, physical
              organic chemistry, the chemistry of natural products, organic photochemistry,
              and structural theory, and whose research activity has been limited by
              deteriorating and obsolete systems.   The project will replace obsolete and
              defective steam radiators with a hydronic fan coil system, increase the
              capacity of air handling systems, boost fume hood exhaust capacity to assure
              appropriate safety measures, install a new electric distribution system,
              replace 67-year old plumbing for water, steam, gas and compressed air, build a
              corridor fire separation system, and remove all asbestos ceiling tiles.  
              Building renovations will substantially improve the research environment for 8
              faculty, and the 53 post docs, 65 graduate students, and 13 undergraduates who
              work with them.  In addition, it will significantly enhance the department's
              effort to recruit new faculty to premier projects in computer-based
              visualization and computation, biotechnology, and advanced materials.  The
              facilities will strengthen research in these areas and research relationships
              with other academic institutions and with the pharmaceutical, computer and
              telecommunications industries.
