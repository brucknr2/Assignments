Abstract    :
                   This award provides partial support for participants for a  conference
              which will be convened at the Institute of Tropical  Meteorology.  The
              conference will focus on the problems associated  with the incorporation of
              satellite information on three-  dimensional moisture distribution into
              atmospheric analyses,  particularly in the tropical regions.  Improvement of
              such analyses  is important for a variety of research and operational weather 
              forecasting purposes and is especially critical for the Global  Energy and
              Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) objectives.  NOAA, NASA,  and ONR are also
              providing support for the conference in separate  awards.
