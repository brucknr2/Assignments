Abstract    :
                    9414474  MacFadden      Forbears of New World Monkeys reached South
              America some time in the early Cenozoic, but because of an inadequate fossil
              record there are only indirect lines of evidence about when or from where -
              direct from Africa remains a distinct possibility.  The first record of them in
              South America occurs at Salla, Bolivia, and dates to about 25 million years
              ago.  The goal of this collaborative field project is to collect and  date
              accurately  more material of the earliest South American primates at Salla and
              possibly elsewhere in Bolivia and to explore Argentina strata of similar age,
              and earlier, where it is very likely ancestral forms should be found.  This
              project will shed much needed light on the origins of these primates who
              evolved in parallel with our own ancestors in Africa.  ***
