Abstract    :
              9414243  Ingraffea  The objective of this research is to evaluate the short-rod
              (SR)  specimen configuration for use in the standardized measurement of 
              fracture toughness of concrete.  Key issues addressed are:        
              1)Applicability of Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM)  testing procedures
              to ASTM C39 standard cylinder size for low,  medium,and high strength concrete;
                      2)Applicability of cohesive fracture mechanics-based testing 
              procedures for low, medium, and high strength concrete; and         3)The
              applicability of simplified size-effect adjustment  procedures to estimate
              valid fracture toughness (Klc)    The project consists of two principal tasks,
              testing and  simulation.  Two levels of SR testing will be performed on three 
              sizes of specimens, and three strengths of concrete.  Level 1  will assume LEFM
              behavior.  Level II will account for large scale  inelasticity, and could also
              measure Klc  from sub-size  specimens.  The SR results will be compared to
              those obtained  from testing using the European standard.    Computer
              simulation will be used to:       test the validity of the inelasticity
              correction factor used    in Level II testing;       assess the consistency and
              accuracy of this approach for all  sizes and strengths tested; and      
              recalibrate the current standard SR geometries for optimal  testing of
              concrete.    The results of this project could lead to a reliable, simple, and 
              inexpensive standard test procedure for a concrete property whose  measurement
              is of increasing importance.  ***
