              #9414514    Joseph Brennan    Abstract:    Tight Closure, Big Cohen-Macaulay
              Modules and Uniform  Artin-Rees The three topics listed in the title of these 
              lectures have  provided distinct yet suprisingly intertwined threads in 
              commutative algebra. These lectures will provide a general  presentation of
              these topics with a view towards examination  of the relationship of the
              homological conjectures to the  resolution of singularities, the Relation-Type
              conjecture,  the strong uniform Artin-Rees conjecture, and the strong 
              Macaulayification conjecture.
