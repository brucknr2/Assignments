Abstract    :
              9414058  Skog    Travel costs and per diem are provided to enable the PI to
              visit  Nanjing China where she will examine fossil fern material and  interact
              with Dr. Sun Ge of the Paleontological Institute in  Nanjing with whom she has
              recently discussed collaboration.    Dr. Skog is an established paleobotanist
              whose application of  modern technologies to the study of fossil fern material
              in this  country has helped to elucideate relationships of these ancient  land
              plants and revealed information about their distributions  and the paleoclimate
              conditions under which they evolved.  She  seeks to broaden that knowledge of
              extinct fern relationships to  extant taxa by investigating material from
              fossil beds in China.   Her Chinese collaborator has excellent complementary
              training in  Geology, so stratigraphic details or potential problems will be 
              well covered in this collaboration from which both  scientists/countries serve
              to benefit.    It is especially important that such collaborations be
              encouraged  because of the long term political situation which, until very 
              recently, precluded any intellectual exchange and would not  permit the loan of
              specimens for scientific study.  Every such  collaboration that serves to
              foster good working relationships  and trust is of great value to the Chinese
              scientists who will  learn western methodologies/technologies and to U.S.
              scientists  who will have access to material which allows systematic analyses 
              that previously could not incorporate material from China.
