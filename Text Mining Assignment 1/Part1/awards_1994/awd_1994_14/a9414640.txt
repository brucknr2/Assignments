Abstract    :
              9414640  Masada  In this research project, a unified approach is developed 
              combining the extended bond graph method, finite element  analysis, and
              boundary element method for modeling and analysis  of multi-energetic dynamic
              systems. These include elasto-dynamic  and electro-mechanical systems and
              solid-fluid interaction  models. The research results are applied to a
              vibrating flat  plate, and a conducting beam in a magnetic field. Comparisons
              for  these systems are made using the fundamental concepts of  conservation,
              constitutive relations, discretization, virtual  concepts, energy/power
              transformation, and numerical  formulations. The combination of the three
              well-established  techniques greatly extends their individual capabilities and 
              leads to the formulation of a powerful modeling and analysis tool  for
              multi-energetic systems.  ***
