Abstract    :
              This program brings together 20 advanced undergraduate and  graduate women
              students with postdoctoral mentors and active  professional workers in the
              field of specialty of the Summer Math  Institute.  They meet for two weeks at
              the Institute for advanced  Study for a workshop designed to prepare students
              for the summer  institute.  There is a program of lectures and seminars in 
              addition to networking and mentoring opportunities.  The  long-term goal of
              this program is to provide young women  mathematicians role models and a good
              research environment to  help increase the number of women researchers in the
              United  States.
