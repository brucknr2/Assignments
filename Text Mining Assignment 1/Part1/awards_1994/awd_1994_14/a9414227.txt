Abstract    :
              9414227  Foley     Multimedia courseware offers solutions to some of the
              problems in the learning and teaching of computer science.  Beginning students
              in computer science are faced with learning abstract, invisible concepts
              without support for learning the processes of computer science (e.g.,
              programming).  Intermediate and advanced students typically learn through
              experiments (on advanced tools) and lecture, but without the benefit of
              supportive learning environments (e.g., structure and explanation and
              connections from instances to general concepts).  Georgia Tech is developing
              courseware which (1) makes abstract, invisible concepts visible through use of
              software visualization; (2) supports the learning of process through
              software-realized scaffolding; and (3) integrates existing tools with
              pedagogical structure through inter-application communication facilities to
              create learning environments even out of advanced research vehicles.  The work
              involved focuses on three areas: the construction of pedagogically sound tools
              to facilitate the authoring of such modules; the creation of modules to use in
              computer science classrooms and to serve as models; and thorough evaluation of
              both the authoring tools and student modules.  ***
