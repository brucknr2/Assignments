Abstract    :
              INT-9414370  Matkowsky    This U.S.-Russia workshop will be held in September
              1994 in Moscow and will bring together leading experts from both countries to
              discuss Combustion.  Dr. Bernard Matkowsky of Northwestern University will
              serve as the U.S. organizer.  His Russian counterpart is Dr. A. G. Merzhanov of
              the Combustion Institute.  The workshop will focus on both fundamental and
              applied problems of combustion.  The workshop will precede an international
              conference on combustion dedicated to Ya. B. Zeldovich, who is regarded as the
              father of modern combustion science and founder of the world class school of
              combustion research in the former Soviet Union.  This timing will enable U.S.
              engineers to meet a very large group of experts from all parts of the Newly
              Independent States (NIS).  For many years, interaction with former Soviet
              experts in combustion was very limited because of political barriers.  U.S.
              experts will be able to invigorate ties with their colleagues in the NIS, who
              are leaders in the field.    This joint workshop in combustion fulfills the
              program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts
              in the United States and NIS to combine complementary talents and pool research
              resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.  It is expected
              that the meeting will foster new U.S.-Russian partnerships as well as promote
              dissemination of information on current research in combustion.
