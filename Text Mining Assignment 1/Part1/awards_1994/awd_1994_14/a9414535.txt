Abstract    :
              9414535  Haddad       Dynamical Systems as a mathematical subject deals with 
              the study of a group(or more generally a semigroup)G acting  on a set X, and is
              subdivided into 3 distinct but  interacting components: topological dynamics,
              when X is a  topological space and G acts continuously on X; ergodic  theory or
              measurable dynamic, when X is a measure space and  G acts measurably on X; and
              smooth dynamics, when X is a  manifold and G acts differentiably on X      
              This CBMS conference, to be held from June 18 to June  23, 1995 in Bakersfield,
              California, on the campus of The  California State University, entitled
              "TOPOLOGICAL AND  PROBABILISTIC ASPECTS OF SINGLE ORBIT DYNAMICS," with main 
              speaker Professor Benjamin Weiss of the Hebrew University in  Jerusalem.  The
              last CBMS conference dealing with the same  general subject was given by
              Professor Hillel Furstenberg in  Fargo North Dakota in 1990.  Needless to say,
              new  developments in dynamical systems have evolved since then,  making the
              timing for a new conference appropriate.  The  goal of the conference is to
              introduce the speaker's new  approach to "single orbit dynamics" to the study
              of  dynamical systems and to explain how it relates to the  various integral
              notions in ergodic theory and topological  dynamics developed in the
              literature, thus leading the way  to new approaches and results in the area.
