Abstract    :
              9414736  Maxwell  As part of a series of relativistic studies in nuclear
              physics,  two major calculation projects will be undertaken: (1) the 
              development of a phenomenological, relativistic, energy-dependent 
              nucleon-nucleon t-matrix and (2) the continuation of relativistic  studies of
              the (p,2p) reaction conducted in collaboration with  Dr. E.D. Cooper.  ***
