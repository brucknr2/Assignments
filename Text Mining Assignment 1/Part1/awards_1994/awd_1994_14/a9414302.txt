Abstract    :
              9414302   Soffa    An aim of this research program is to clarify the effects of
              processing variables that control microstructure and defect structure in
              manganese/aluminum (MnAl) permanent magnet materials.   A further aim is to
              understand the mechanisms of magnetization and magnetization reversal, which
              account for the hysteresis behavior and magnetic properties of these
              ferromagnets.   A comprehensive electron transmission microscopy study is
              planned to examine the complex diffusional/displacive transformation occurring
              in this material.  Deformation under compression loading is examined under a
              broad temperature range to determine ways of creating desired textures. 
              Magnetic hysteresis is measured for different structural states to determine
              magnetic properties.  This information should provide a sound basis for
              designing thermomechanical processing schemes for optimum manufacturing of
              MnAl-base permanent magnets.     %%%   For more than two decades permanent
              magnet materials based on the manganese/aluminum system have loomed on the
              horizon as important magnetic materials for a wide variety of applications not
              requiring the extraordinary properties of the more expensive rare earth
              permanent magnets.  Application has been limited by the economics related to
              processing.   Research results of this investigation should lead to more
              innovative and efficient processing strategies for manufacturing permanent
              magnets that are based on the MnAl (L1) intermetallic phase.   ***
