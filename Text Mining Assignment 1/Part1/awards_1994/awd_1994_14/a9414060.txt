Abstract    :
              9410460  Westerfield    This three-year award supports U.S.-U.K. cooperative
              research in neurobiology  between two research groups at the University of
              Oregon and University of London.   The U.S. investigators are Monte Westerfield
              and Judith Eisen and the British  investigators are Nigel Holder and Stephen
              Wilson.  The cooperative effort extends  recent research by both groups in
              anterior central nervous system of zebra fish  embryos.  Newly discovered
              genes, have been identified either by cloning or  mutation,  as candidates for
              regulating developmental processes in the central  nervous system of zebra fish
              embryos.  The objective of this new effort is to study  the potential roles of
              these genes in the anterior central nervous system and brain  segments of zebra
              fish.    Zebra fish are ideal vertebrates for studying embryonic and genetic
              analyses since a  large number of their regulatory genes have already been
              identified.  The results  from this project, when compared with complementary
              studies in mammals, will  advance our knowledge about the evolution of the
              anterior regions of the vertebrate  central nervous system in general, the
              genetic mechanisms that regulate patterning,  and gene expression that
              demarcate brain subdivisions.  The project takes advantage  of complementary
              expertise of the U.S. and British investigators and provides access  to mutant
              zebra fish and genetic sequencing techniques developed by both groups.
