Abstract    :
              9414112  Wang    Economic analysis of markets relies on the examination of two
              key  variables, price and quantity.  In the study of financial  markets,
              however, the focus has been mainly on the behavior of  security prices while
              little attention has been paid to  quantities like trading volume.  This is
              because trading volume  provides no additional information about prices in
              conventional  representative-agent models.  But these models perform poorly in 
              explaining the historic security returns.  This has led  researchers to develop
              models with incomplete security markets  and heterogeneous investors.  In these
              models, the dynamic  relation between volume and returns of individual stocks
              depends  on differences in information among investors (e.g. some  investors
              have better information about future payoffs) and other  differences among
              heterogeneous investors.  This project develops  an equilibrium model of stock
              trading and pricing in an  intertemporal multi-asset setting.  The model
              involves  dynamically optimizing investors who trade competitively in the 
              market for both informational and non-informational reasons.   Their trading
              drives the equilibrium prices of stocks as well as  the volume of trade. 
              Testable implications will be derived  concerning the time series as well as
              cross-sectional behavior of  the joint price-volume series of individual
              stocks.  The second  part involves the empirical analysis of the data on the
              price-  volume series of individual stocks and the direct tests of the 
              theoretical implications.
