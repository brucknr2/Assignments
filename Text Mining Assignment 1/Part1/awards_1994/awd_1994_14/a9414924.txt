Abstract    :
              The University of California Berkeley will receive ARI Facilities support to
              create modern facilities for researchers working in a unique, integrated
              Program in Biological Chemistry and Engineering within the College of
              Chemistry.  The renovated facilities will promote a strong interaction among
              bioinorganic chemists, biochemical engineers, and bioorganic chemists working
              in the areas of biotechnology and environmental research.  The renovations
              activity funded by this award will be directed at the improvement of 1,305
              square meters in 30-year old Latimer Hall and will consolidate researchers. 
              Program activity will be enhanced as researchers are currently located in
              geographically distributed campus laboratories that are between 32 and 77 years
              old.  A 7 month- long space assessment precedes the project which will involve
              gutting much of the interior space, installation of modular laboratory units
              and new fume hoods and upgrades to the mechanical, electrical and plumbing
              services for increased safety and improved efficiency.  Provision of adequate
              facilities will enable the basic discovery processes to be linked more closely
              with the development process.  Biochemical engineers will study separation
              techniques for the recovery of biological products, biomimetic adsorbents for
              metal removal and recovery and new approaches to bioremediation.  Bioinorganic
              chemists will study metal ion transport that is essential to life processes,
              the use of chelating agents in the sequestration of heavy metals, and
              lanthanide complexes for possible use in enhancing MRI.  A total of 8
              professors and 117 graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will benefit from
              these improvements.
