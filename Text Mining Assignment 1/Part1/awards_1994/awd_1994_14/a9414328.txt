Abstract    :
              9414328  McMahon    The primary objective of this U.S.-Czech research project
              between  Dr. Charles McMahon of the University of Pennsylvania and Dr.  Pavel
              Lejcek of the Institute of Physics of the Czech Academy of  Sciences is to
              study the type of brittle cracking that takes  place in high-strength materials
              under conditions where a mobile  element exists on the surface.  To do this,
              the researchers will  measure crack-growth rates in specially prepared
              bicrystals of  Fe-Si alloys as a function of direction in the grain boundary.  
              This will be done because the rate of diffusion along a boundary  can vary
              greatly with direction.  Results are expected to yield  and validate a model
              useful in calculating the rate of crack  advance.  In the process, the
              researchers also hope to establish  a general method of inhibiting this type of
              cracking.  Success  should contribute to our knowledge of problems associated
              with  stress-relief cracking in welds in alloy-steel components and in  various
              types of hot-deformation processing.    This project in materials research
              fulfills the program objective  of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling
              experts in the  United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary
              talents  and share research resources in areas of strong mutual interest  and
              competence.    ***
