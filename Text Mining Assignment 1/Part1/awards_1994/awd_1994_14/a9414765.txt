Abstract    :
              9414765  Box       The emphasis in this research is the development of a 
              technique that employs feedback control to collect data on process 
              disturbances or errors which are caused by unassignable causes and  cannot be
              removed by statistical process control (SPC) method.  The  technique is
              tailored for application by the work force to make  process adjustments to
              combat the effect of disturbances.  Feedback  charts that take into account the
              cost of being off target, cost of  adjustment, and cost of taking observations
              will be developed.  A  wide range of models will be investigated, their
              sensitivity to  model assumption analyzed, and their practical utility tested. 
              The  feasibility and advantages of employing more elaborate control  schemes
              will also be considered in the study.       The feedback process control method
              developed will make it  possible to put into the hands of a much larger
              workforce and the  statistical process community a scientific procedure that
              can  significantly affect manufacturing quality and productivity.
