Abstract    :
              9414161  Summers  The 1995 Keystone Symposium METAL AND OXYGEN REGULATION OF
              GENE EXPRESSION will be held March 18 - March 24 at Park City, Utah. Although
              the sub-discipline of biochemistry called "metallo-enzymology" has recognized
              since early in this   century a role for metals in certain biological
              catalyses, it is only in the last 12 - 14 years that the pervasive role of
              metals in every aspect of cellular function has come more widely to light. This
              new appreciation of metallo-biochemistry or bio-organic chemistry is largely a
              result of advances in biophysics and chemical spectroscopy which allow
              sophisticated assessment of the behavior of metals with a variety of biological
              ligands, from proteins or their prosthetic groups to nucleic acids and
              carbohydrates. The information gathered through this new observational and
              analytic power suggests that all significant biological processes are
              influenced by metals at some stage.  Moreover, this information understanding
              is not simply of academic interest, as certain metals have already proven to be
              potent anti-tumor agents and powerful tools for analysis and manipulation of
              biomolecules.  Similarly, we are at a watershed in our appreciation of the role
              of oxygen compounds and intermediates in biology. While always seen as
              essential for higher forms of life, oxygen and its metabolites have been more
              recently recognized as key players in development, host defense mechanisms,
              neoplasia, and aging. Since the discovery of the mechanism of hemoglobin,
              oxygen metabolism has been clearly associated with metal chemistry. In
              intervening decades much more of the enzymology of oxygen metabolism (as well
              as that of other biologically important gases including nitrogen, nitric oxide,
              carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide) has been shown to involve metals at key steps.
               This conference is unique in including both metals and oxygen and in focusing
              on the subject of regulation of gene expression by them.  %%%  Metals and
              oxygen play a role in virtually every aspect of ce llular function. 
              Increasingly, these roles are being recognized and studied.  The 1995 Keystone
              Symposium on metal and oxygen regulation of gene expression will bring together
              researchers in this important and developing field.  Genetic regulation by
              metal and oxygen has significant impact on the environment, agriculture, and
              health.  ***
