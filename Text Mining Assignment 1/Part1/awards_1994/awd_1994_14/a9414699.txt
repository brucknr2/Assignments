Abstract    :
              Professor Mark A. Ratner at the Department of Chemistry, Northwestern  
              University, is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational
              Chemistry Program to study a number of systems with coupled   modes through the
              use of static and time dependent mean field methods.   These methods are being
              extended, especially to provide the theoretical   capability to study large
              systems of practical interest. The static mean   field techniques are being
              improved using perturbation theory, while the   dynamic, or time dependent,
              techniques are being extended to include   mixed quantum mechanical and 
              classical mechanical treatments. A wide   range of systems and properties,
              which include the low energy excitations   of porphyrins and peptides, proton
              transfer reactions, and cluster   melting, are to be studied with these mean
              field methods.  The principal concern of Prof. Ratner's work is the study of
              complex   systems which are directly connected to real problems in Materials  
              Science and Biology. Mean field methods, Prof. Ratner's primary   theoretical
              tools, involve using averages of various kinds of   interactions and provide
              the essential simplification needed to treat   these real systems. It has been
              shown that they have the capability to   treat the statics and the dynamics of
              coupled mode quantum mechanical   systems. Static methods are being used to
              study systems of biological   interest while time-dependent methods are being
              used to study dynamic   behavior in solids, in clusters, and in solutions.
