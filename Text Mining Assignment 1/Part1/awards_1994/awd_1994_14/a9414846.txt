Abstract    :
              9414846  Savoie    This program focuses on the chemical, physical and radiative 
              properties of aerosols over th North Atlantic Ocean.  At present  the estimates
              of direct (as well as indirect) aerosol forcing are  highly uncertain because
              of many unknown factors about aerosols:   their composition, size distribution
              and radiative properties, and  the temporal and spatial variability of these
              properties.  The work  includes (1) continuous sampling to extend the chemical 
              climatologies that were developed during the first two phases of  AEROCE, (2)
              an initiation of continuous measurement of aerosol  absorption and total
              integrated aerosol scattering, and (3)  intensive measurements of
              size-segregated aerosol chemistry on four  islands in the tropical and
              subtropical North Atlantic Ocean (NAO):   Bermuda; barbados; Tenerife, Canary
              Islands; and Lanzorote, Canary  Islands.  Daily bulk aerosol samples from all
              of the sites will be  analyzed for (1) nss-SO4 =, derived from anthropogenic
              sources and  biological sources in the ocean; (2) MSA, an atmospheric oxidation
               product of DMS which is produced by biological sources in the  ocean; (3)
              NO3-, derived from continental and oceanic sources; (5)  Na+, for sea salt; and
              (6) nss-K+m as a tracer fir biomass burning.   Continuous measurements will
              also be made of (1) total integrated  aerosol scatter using integrating
              nephelometer, (2) aerosol  composition in two size ranges (1-10um diameter and
              the fraction  below 1 um), (3) total aerosol number concentration using 
              condensation particle counters, and (4) total aerosol absorption  coefficient
              using aerosol absorption photometers.  th latter data  will be supplemented
              with spectral reflectance measurement made in  the laboratory using a diode
              array spectrophotometer.  The data  will be interpreted in terms of the
              physical, chemical, and  radiative properties of aerosols associated with
              specific source  regions and types.
