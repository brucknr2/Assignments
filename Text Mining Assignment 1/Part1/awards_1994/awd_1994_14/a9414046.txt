Abstract    :
              Organic nitrates (RONO2) play important roles in the atmospheric  chemistry of
              Nitrogen oxides NOx (NOx = NO, NO2) and represent a  major area of interaction
              between atmospheric cycles of nitrogen  and organic carbon.  Nonetheless, the
              detailed removal process of  organic nitrates from the atmosphere is not well
              understood.  This  research project will study organic nitrates and their
              related  reaction using a sensitive new multipass absorption technique,  cavity
              ring-down optical spectroscopy.  The immediate goal of the  research and
              planning activities is to gain additional experience  with this new instrument
              and obtain some preliminary experimental  results with it.  During the planning
              period, specific experiments  will be performed to examine the spectroscopy and
              photochemical  reactions related to ethyl nitrates in the atmosphere.  The 
              activities associated with this research planning grant will lay  the necessary
              groundwork for the next stage of experiments.  The  experimental results will
              demonstrate the principal investigator's  ability in performing competitive
              research in field of atmospheric  chemistry and will lead to the development of
              subsequent NSF  proposals.
