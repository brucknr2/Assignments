              Title: Development/Testing of a Convective Wake Parameterization of      
              Air/Sea Fluxes and Convective Organization Using TOGA COARE       IOP Results  
               The proposal aims at parameterizing air-sea interface fluxes in the  context
              of convective organization processes.  Such physically  correct
              parameterizations are meant to be used in future GCMs and  climate models.  The
              PI will also test and validate these  parameterizations with the help of the
              COARE data.
