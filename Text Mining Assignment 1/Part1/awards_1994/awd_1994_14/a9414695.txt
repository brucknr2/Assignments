Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT   Arthur  J. Ragauskas  CTS-9414695    This is a study  of the chemical
              pathways by which mercapto-derived antioxidants photostabilize mechanical
              pulps.  The principal factor limiting use of mechanical  pulp is its tendency
              to undergo color reversion.  All types of mechanical pulp suffer from surface
              discoloration induced thermally or photonically.  The processes causing surface
              discoloration also cause oxidative degradation of the carbohydrate and lignin
              components of wood fibers.  The accepted mechanism for this process involves
              photoexcitation of extended conjugated structures in lignin; this initiates a
              free-radical process either by intramolecular bond cleavage, by intermolecular
              abstraction of phenolic hydrogen, or by generation of singlet oxygen.  Although
              the mechanisms of photoyellowing have received substantial attention, the ways
              in which antioxidants could retard this  process are not well understood.  In
              this work, the mechanisms by which thiol groups can inhibit these processes are
              examined.        Mechanical pulp for papermaking is a more efficient
              intermediate than chemical pulp.  Generally, chemical pulp uses only the
              cellulose in wood, while mechanical pulp contains 85% of the original wood mass
              including cellulose hemicellulose, and lignin.  However, mechanical pulp is
              more difficult to stabilize chemically, and this limits its use for most paper
              products.  This is the issue addressed in this project.  This award is part of
              the Special Initiative in Environmentally Benign Chemical Synthesis and
              Processing.
