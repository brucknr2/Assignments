Abstract    :
              The Conference will stress topics that are of great current  interest and of
              importance to both Particle and Nuclear  Physics communities.  It will
              concentrate upon mutually  beneficial cooperation between particle and nuclear
              physics  in Science , in Technology, and in the Facilities through  which such
              endeavours are being pursued.  The Conference  will highlight the importance
              and diversity of particle and  nuclear physics in the energy range 1 to 150 GeV
              and beyond.  Particular emphasis will be placed on reaching out beyond  the
              present frontiers of physics through high intensity and  high precision
              experiments as distinct from those efforts  which intend to roll back the
              energy frontier.  Funds be  used for advanced graduate students to attend the 
              Conference.  ***
