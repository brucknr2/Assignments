Abstract    :
              9414271  Roth  Rutgers University    New knowledge about the structures and
              reactions of organic radical cations will be provided as well as new insights
              into light-induced electron transfer reactions. A variety of radical cations
              will be generated in a range of media, including fluid solutions, frozen
              glasses, and solid supports (e.g., zeolites) by methods that include
              photo-induced electron transfer, chemical oxidation, and radiolysis. Their
              structures will be characterized by spectroscopic methods which include optical
              spectroscopy, ESR, and CIDNP. The experiments will supplemented by ab initio
              molecular orbital calculations.     This grant from the Organic Dynamics
              Program supports the continuing work of Professor Heinz D. Roth at Rutgers
              University. Radical cations that will be studied by Professor Roth are reactive
              molecules that carry one unit of positive charge and one electron that is not
              paired with another electron. Radical cations may under go reaction either at
              the unpaired electron site or at the site of positive charge. These reactions
              as well as others will be addressed in this research. In addition, the
              structures of radical cations will be determined by modern spectroscopic
              techniques in various environments. Theoretical calculations will supplement
              the experiments.
