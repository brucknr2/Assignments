Abstract    :
              Fox    NSF/CBMS Regional Research Conference Proposal #9414820  ABSTRACT:    A
              fundamental goal of  mathematics is to find the  RinvariantsS of  objects
              studied---the characteristic  signatures that distinguish these objects from
              others. For  example, a ball is distinguished from a donut by the fact  that a
              donut has one hole while the ball has none. The NSF  CBMS program, RIndex
              Theory, Coarse Geometry, and Topology  of Manifolds, S will give an overview of
              current work in  finding invariants for a class of geometric objects.  The 
              type of invariants studied in this research are similar in  spirit to those in
              the donut/ball example, though vastly  more complicated and useful.  There is
              already a hint that  this research could have  profound applications  in the 
              exploding field of biotechnology.  For example, index theory  gives biochemists
              the tools to describe and classify the  various ways that the macro-molecules
              of life twist and turn  in space, a difficult and extremely important problem. 
                John Roe of Oxford University will give ten lectures on this  multifaceted
              area of mathematics. The lectures will serve  several purposes.  They will
              present new and difficult ideas  that  blend  several areas of mathematics,
              including  topology, geometry and analysis.  They will also introduce  graduate
              students to ground-breaking and fundamental  mathematical research.
              Additionally, John Roe, a gifted  writer on mathematics, will  produce a
              monograph on these  lectures, which will prove a valuable resource for those 
              attending, and for the mathematics community at large.
