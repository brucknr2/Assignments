Abstract    :
              9414007  Tsiatas, George    This is an instrumentation award.  The equipment
              will be used for  infrastructure  related research.  Five projects that  will 
              make  extensive use of this equipment are:    a)   Fatigue strength evaluation
              of deteriorated highway bridges.    b)   The use of "fatigue fuses" under
              variable amplitude loading       develop predictive methodologies for the
              fatigue life of       steel highway bridges.    c)   Acoustic non-destructive
              techniques for structural integrity       monitoring    d)   Study of a new
              class of extremely high strength but brittle       materials, emphasizing the
              use of new acoustics sensors to       predict impending failure.    e)  
              Application of geosynthetic materials for use in local       infrastructure
              rehabilitation.    Support  for the research will be provided from the Rhode 
              Island  of  Transportation  and local companies.   The  interaction  with 
              local  industry  provides  a  unique  opportunity  for  expanding  innovative  
              technology  to  a  variety  of  new  areas   through  collaborative research
              efforts.  A new state-of-the-art  facility  will  be  available  soon  to house
               the  equipment  in  the  new  engineering building.  ***
