Abstract    :
              9414097  Pope      This U.S.-Polish Joint Cooperative Research on "Activation of
              Small Molecules  on Polyoxometalate Surfaces" is between Dr. Michael T. Pope of
              Georgetown  University and  Dr. Krzysztof Filipek of the University of Silesia.
               The  proposed collaboration is related to Dr. Pope's current NSF grant, CHE- 
              9215228, "Modulation of Surface Reactivity of Large Polyoxometalate Anions."  
              Specifically, the principal investigators intend to explore and/or develop the 
              activation of small molecules (e.g., NO, NO2, CO2, SO2, O2) by appropriately 
              modified polyoxometalate anions in aqueous and non-aqueous solvents.  The 
              binding of NO, O2, SO2, and CO2 to polyoxometalates has already been 
              demonstrated in earlier work from Georgetown and elsewhere.  The focus of Dr. 
              Filipek's recent research has been on the binding and multi-electron reduction 
              of dinitrogen and nitrogen oxides with ruthenium-containing polyoxometalates.  
              this ties in closely with the experience developed at Georgetown regarding the 
              redox chemistry of polyoxometalates, and the characterization of 
              tungstoruthenates.  The ability of polyoxometalates reversibly to accept two, 
              four, or more electrons suggests that pathways could exist for channelling 
              reduction equivalents to the bound "substrates.:  It is clear because of the 
              strong overlap in interests, both research programs will benefit from the 
              collaboration.                                                  This proposed
              research in polyoxometalate chemistry fulfills the program  objectives of
              advancing science by enabling leading experts in the U.S. and  Poland to
              combine complementary talents and pool research resources in areas  of strong
              mutual interest and competence.  ***
