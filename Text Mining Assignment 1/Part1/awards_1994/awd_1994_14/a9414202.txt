Abstract    :
              9414202  Curry      Funds are provided for the continued operation of the 
              deepsea core and dredge samples' repository at Woods Hole  Oceanographic. 
              These samples are vital to our understanding  of the past and present oceans,
              climates and events on the  continent.  Newly acquired cores will be integrated
              into the  curatorial system and the old cores and dredges will be  continued to
              be curated and distributed to scientists  requesting samples. The core lab at
              WHOI also serves as a  center for design and development of tools for marine 
              geological sample acquisition.  ***
