Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    Proposal Number:  9414446  Principle Investigator:  Nassaralla    
              This is a study of the sources of hexavalent chromium in spent chrome-
              magnesite brick.  The amount of chromium (VI) in new brick is correlated with
              the brick production process variables (firing temperature, bonding type,
              chemical composition).  The effect of brick impurities on formation of
              hexavalent chromium is studied at various temperatures; an attempt is made to
              explain the relatively high levels of chromium (VI) in the cold face of the
              refractory relative to the hot face.     Chrome-magnesite refractories are used
              extensively in the steel, copper, and glass industries.  They are slowly
              consumed and must be replaced from time to time.  Spent chrome-magnesite brick
              is classified as a hazardous waste because of its high levels of hexavalent
              chromium.  Reduction or elimination of chromium (VI) formation would reduce
              disposal costs and environmental threat.
