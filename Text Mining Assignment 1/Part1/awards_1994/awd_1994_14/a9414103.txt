Abstract    :
              9414103  Casey   This award provides partial (50%) funding for the acquisition
              of a scanning probe microscope system that will be installed and operated in
              the Department of Land, Air and Water Resources at the University of
              California, Davis. The institution is committed to providing the remaining
              funds needed for the acquisition of the equipment.   The microscope system will
              be used primarily to examine, at the molecular level, the surface of minerals
              at the water-mineral interface in order to study the mechanisms and rates of
              dissolution-precipitation-adsorption processes in the natural environment.  ***
