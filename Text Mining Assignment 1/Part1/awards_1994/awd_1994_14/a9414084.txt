Abstract    :
              9414084  Kirk  This Americas Program award will  support  a collaborative
              research between Drs.  T. Kent Kirk and Dan Cullen, Forest Products
              Laboratory,University of Wisconsin,  Madison, and Prof. Rafael Vicuna,
              Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile.  The  aim of this project is to
              advance the characterization of the ligninolytic system of  the white-rot
              basidiomycete Ceriporiopsis subvermispora , mainly at the genetic  level, with
              the goal of improving the  treatment of wood pulp by the use of  biological
              methods. The joint research will be performed in both the Madison and  Chilean
              laboratories.  The investigators' past collaboration has shown that there are 
              fundamental differences in enzyme expression patterns in defined liquid media
              vs.  solid substrates.   With these results in mind,  the present study 's
              emphasis is  directed toward characterizing the enzymes and genes expressed in
              complex, woody  substrates.       This is very important research.  The basic
              information obtained from the study  could potentially be utilized to improve
              the efficiency of the fungus in biopulping  and it is believed that biological
              treatment of wood fiber during processing with  either whole-cell
              ligning-degrading microorganisms or microbial enzymes may  someday eliminate
              the use of polluting compounds that are presently used.   ***
