Abstract    :
                Granaas    The University of South Dakota is the recipient of NSF funds to
              support the  renovation of the Human Factors Research Laboratory located in the
              64-year old  South Dakota Union Building.  The modernization of over 1,550
              square feet will  provide students and faculty with the opportunity to conduct
              contemporary research  and research training within the Human Factors program. 
              The role of Human Factors  Psychology has grown commensurately with modern
              society's increasing reliance  upon technology.  As emerging technologies have
              progressively increased the  complexity of human-machine and human-system
              interactions, Human Factors  psychologists have been playing an increasingly
              important role in the analysis,  modeling, and design of systems to increase
              worker safety and productivity.  The  program has trained 57 Ph.D.'s since its
              founding in 1965.  The multidisciplinary  training program is research based
              and places heavy demands upon the laboratory  infrastructure which has become
              outmoded and crowded.  As one of only 24  universities nationally to establish
              a Ph.D.-level training program in human factors,  the laboratory renovation is
              important to understanding the human-machine interaction  and the development
              and use of future technologies.
