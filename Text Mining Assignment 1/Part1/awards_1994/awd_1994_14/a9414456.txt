Abstract    :
              This research program aims to comprehend physical mechanisms  underlying the
              magnetically dominated energy-conversion processes  that drive solar
              terrestrial activity.  This will involve the  formulation of an MHD treatment
              of transport-enriched evolution and  instability processes, and their
              three-dimensional nonlinear  simulation on supercomputers.  The strategic goal
              of these  realistic simulations is to use observable inputs to achieve a 
              predictive capability with respect to solar activity.  Studies  performed under
              this project will help in understanding related  phenomena in the wider
              universe of astrophysics, and by the need to  predict their consequences in the
              solar-terrestrial system.
