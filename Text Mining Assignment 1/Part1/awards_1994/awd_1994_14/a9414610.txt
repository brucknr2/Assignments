Abstract    :
              9414610  Komanduri  A study will be made of the tribological interactions 
              between fine polishing abrasives and the surface of advanced  ceramic materials
              (alumina and silicon nitride).  The  chemical and mechanical causes of material
              removal will be  determined in detail to the extent possible by the use of a 
              number of in situ measurement techniques, including  tribological testing
              inside an environmental scanning  electron microscope.  The results will be
              used to validate  models developed on the basis of fracture mechanics and 
              thermodynamics.  ***
