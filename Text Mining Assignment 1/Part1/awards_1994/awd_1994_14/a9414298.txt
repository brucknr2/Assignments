Abstract    :
              9414298  Ohuchi  In this proposal we outline a research program to investigate
              the growth and characterization of new GaAs based structures.  the motivation
              of this program originated from our on-going research effort to develop novel
              processing routes for growing heterostructures without regard to their lattice
              matching requirement.  In this effort, we have developed a growth method called
              van der Waals epitaxy (VDWE).  VDWE is the epitaxial growth of
              crystallographically two-dimensional (2D) layered materials, of which layers
              are held together by van der Waals forces, and contain no unsatisfied covalent
              bonds at the surface.  We have demonstrated in the past that these van der
              Waals materials can be grown epitaxially on a wide range of three-dimensional
              (3D) materials including GaAs, A12O3 and CaF2.  If GaAs Layers could then be
              grown on top of this van der Waals surface, it would be possible to effectively
              decouple the interface between the two 3D materials with dissimilar lattice
              constants and thereby accommodate the lattice mismatch.  Due to the weak van
              der Waals forces across the interface, it is also possible to remove (or
              lift-off) the epitaxial layers for both characterizing broad area thin films
              and further processing of decoupled heterostructure devices.  ***
