Abstract    :
              This grant in the Research at Undergraduate Institutions  (RUI) program is for a
              faculty member in the physics  department at Ball State University to
              participate in the  analysis of a major Fermilab fixed target experiment, E683-
               Photoproduction of High Pt Jets.  Prof. Thomas has been a  participant in the
              experiment (using an NSF grant) from its  inception and has effectively used it
              as a research  experience for Ball State undergraduates and as the research 
              project for their masters degree program.  Two students used  projects in E683
              to earn their masters degrees during his  last grant and two are in progress.
