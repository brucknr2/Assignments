Abstract    :
              9414511  Luzzi    This grant supports a 12-month research visit  in Japan for
              Professor David Luzzi, Department  of Materials Science and Engineering, 
              University of Pennsylvania, to Kyoto  University, where he will work with
              Professor  Masaharu Yamaguchi of the Department of Metal  Science and
              Technology.  The research project  focuses on the dependance of interface 
              structure on processing conditions and the  effect on mechanical properties in 
              directionally solidified in-situ composite  materials.      The project takes
              advantage of the process  expertise of the Japanese group led by Dr.  Yamaguchi
              and the specialized equipment present  in his lab.  The economic implications
              of the  development of these high-temperature materials  is significant,
              especially for the aerospace  industry.  The research should lead to the 
              development of several candidate materials  systems, whose applications should
              increase  steadily over time as the materials are  improved and costs are
              reduced.  In addition to  carrying out research at Kyoto University,  Professor
              Luzzi will visit Japanese companies  which are active in high-temperature
              materials  research.   ***
