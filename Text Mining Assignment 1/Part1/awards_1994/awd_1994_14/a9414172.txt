Abstract    :
              9414172  Hobbs  This project is an airborne study of arctic stratus clouds  with
              the objective of obtaining several comprehensive sets  of simultaneous
              measurements of their microstructure and  spectral radiative properties.  Such
              concurrent  measurements are basic to the improvement of current models  of
              radiative properties of stratus clouds.  These models in  turn are a crucial
              component of global circulation models  which form an important basis for
              global change studies.  The development of optimized radiative forcing
              algorithms  is the objective of a major research effort.    Additional
              objectives of this project are to measure the  spectral reflective properties
              of various arctic surfaces  such as tundra, open ocean, and melting and
              refreezing sea  ice, and to test a new approach for distinguishing water 
              clouds from snow and ice surfaces.  The observations will  be made from a
              Convair C-131A aircraft configured  specifically for airborne research.  ***
