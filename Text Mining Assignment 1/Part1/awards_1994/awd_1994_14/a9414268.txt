Abstract    :
              9414268  Montgomery  This  research  covers  a  broad  spectrum  of 
              interdisciplinary  activity   ranging  from  the  design,  chemical  synthesis 
               and  molecular characterization of organic superconductors, to crystal  growth
                and   materials  characterization   important   to   the  fabrication of
              small-scalc electrical devices. A long range  goal  of  the research is to
              identify the factors that are esential  to  making  organic  superconductors 
              by  design  so  that  so   that  superconducting  or~anic  materials  with 
              substantially   higher  transition temperatures can be prepared.    %%%    In 
              the  last  ten  years tremendous strides have  been  made  in  raising  the 
              superconducting  transition  temperature  in   both  inorganic   and   organic 
              materials.  Because  of   the   higher  temperatures  that  have been obtained
              with inorganic  materials,  the  majority of the research and theory
              development has been  in  this    area.   This   proposal   covers   the  
              synthesis    and  characterization   of  several  classes  of   potential  
              organic  superconductors.
