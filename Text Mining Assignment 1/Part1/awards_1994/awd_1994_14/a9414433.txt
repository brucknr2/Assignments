Abstract    :
              This Research Collections project will address the difficult job of assisting
              and facilitating the salvage and preservation of a valuable Russian collection
              of natural sounds.  These irreplaceable recordings currently exist on archaic
              and rapidly degrading media and reside in a physical facility that dose little
              to augment their state of preservation and availability for use by other
              scientists.  The project is a first-class collaboration between the Library of
              Natural Sounds (LNS) at Cornell University and Russian Phonoteka of Animal
              Voices, (PAV).  Original recordings will be transcribed to more modern media
              with duplicate recordings being made and housed at different sites. Through the
              LNS, availability to other user scientists will be greatly enhanced and the
              latest technologies for natural sound preservation will be employed. 
              Collections such as these will continue to increase in both basic and applied
              value as reference materials for basic research in animal vocalization and
              communication, as sources for identifying species for environmental
              assessments, and as contributors  to the increasing array of commercial
              products that utilize natural sounds in their production.
