Abstract    :
              *** 9414803 Barth West Chester University of Pennsylvania is the recipient of
              ARI funds for the renovation of research space on the second floor of the
              science center to create an interdisciplinary Material Research Center (MRC). 
              This project will enable six faculty members to consolidate and enhance the
              focus of their materials research and training activities.  Research is
              presently conducted in cramped locations dispersed throughout the Chemistry
              department.  Laboratories are  subjected to dust, flooding, and lack adequate
              temperature and humidity control, creating an unsafe working environment. 
              Utilities systems such as the HVAC, electrical, plumbing, and fire protection
              will be upgraded and installed to meet current codes.  Once renovations are
              completed, the MRC will consists of six faculty/student research laboratories
              surrounding two centrally located service laboratories that will contain spaces
              for instrumentation, sample preparation, thermal treatment, and glass blowing,
              and equipment fabrications.  The centralization of research activities, and the
              provision for shared spaces, will promote better interaction among faculty and
              students involved in materials research, and provide a more concerted
              interdisciplinary approach to the study of materials science.  Efficient and
              improved space will provide students with more research opportunities and will
              enhance the productivity of faculty.***
