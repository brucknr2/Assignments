Abstract    :
              9414015  Sameh    This award will establish a high bandwidth network of high
              performance workstations for research in parallel computing. The research
              supported by this infrastructure includes research on distributed sparse matrix
              algorithms, parallel algorithms for signal processing, parallel algorithms for
              the n-body problem,  large scale distributed neural databases, parallel task
              scheduling, and parallel operating systems.  ***
