Abstract    :
              Keil:  Funds awarded to the University of Dayton will be used to renovate 4,800
              square feet of Biology, Chemistry, and Physics research space within the 35
              year old Sherman and Wohlleben Halls.  The infrastructure of these facilities,
              especially the HVAC, hood, plumbing and electrical systems is unsatisfactory
              and compromises the ability, both in scope and rigor, to conduct necessary
              experiments.  In addition, the current state of the laboratories discourages
              research participation by students.  Four faculty and more than twenty students
              will directly benefit from the infrastructure improvements; research programs
              examining the regulation of plant metabolism, chemical reactions of DNA
              molecules, biological applications of ceramic materials, and electro-optics
              will be enhanced.  Student interest in science and participation in research,
              especially within the under-represented groups, is expected to increase with
              the opportunity to work in modern laboratories.  The NSF-funded portion of the
              project is part of an ambitious campus effort to renovate more than 200,000
              square feet of campus science facilities.
