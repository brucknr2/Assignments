Abstract    :
              9414558  Casey  A major practical limitation to the application of high
              resolution  two-dimensional ultrasonic imaging is the size and flexibility of 
              the cable linking the transmitter/receive transducer element with  the powering
              and processing electronics.  The PI's have  successfully fabricated a prototype
              based on a combination of a  fiber optics and integrated optoelectronics, which
              would replace  the cumbersome coaxial cable currently used to excite the
              transmit  pulses for relatively small linear transducer arrays.  They propose 
              the use of the Electronics and Power Sources Directorate (EPSD)  facility for
              assistance in the design and fabrication of the  photoconductive semiconductor
              switch (PCSS) which is the critical  element of our approach.  Support of the
              proposed research would be  in direct support of advanced biomedical ultrasound
              techniques  already being partially supported by the National Science 
              Foundation as well as Army interests in the application of high  resolution
              ultrasonic non-destructive evaluation (NDE) to materials  and structures of
              military significance.  ***
