Abstract    :
                  9414900       Wallace, Douglas    The utility of using mitochondrial DNA
              variation to assess  genetic variation in human populations and to reconstruct 
              human migration patterns has been demonstrated by many  studies, going back to
              the well-known "Eve" hypothesis.  For  this reason, recent investigations of
              human origins in the  New World and Asia have used mtDNA variation to trace 
              genetic links between populations in these regions.  While  it is clear that
              New World populations are derived from  northern Asian populations, it is not
              so clear how many  migrations there were into the New World, and from how many 
              source populations (variously argued as one, three, or even  four separate
              migrations).  Analysis of northern Asian  populations is required to address
              these issues.    This project to collect and analyze samples from Siberian 
              populations is timely and will provide critical information  for further
              investigation of these issues.  The graduate  student has previous field
              experience in this area, and has  established the groundwork for collecting the
              samples, is  well versed in the analytic techniques, and has alrealy co- 
              authored important papers in this area.  The project will  return important and
              intersting information.  ***
