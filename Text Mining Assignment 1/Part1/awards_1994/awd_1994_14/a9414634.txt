Abstract    :
                      9414634  McDowell  This project is to study the path dependence of the
              constitutive  behavior of shape memory alloys (SMA).  SMA materials are used in
               "smart structure" applications to provide damping or as medical  devices.  The
              hysteresis loop changes during cyclic loading and  dislocations are also
              generated to accommodate the phase changes  associated with their primary
              response.  The research will provide  data on how multi-axial states of stress
              and loading path affect  the behavior.  ***
