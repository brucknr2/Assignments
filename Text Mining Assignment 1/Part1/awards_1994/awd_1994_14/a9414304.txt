Abstract    :
                 9414304 Regel  The goal of this research project is to develop centrifugation
              as a tool for manufacturing of improved electronic materials. The objective is
              to improve understanding of directional solidification in a centrifuge.  Zinc
              doped indium antimonide will be directionally solidified in a centrifuge using
              the gradient freeze technique in the thermally stable configuration (freezing
              upward). Current interface demarcation will be used to reveal the solid liquid
              interface shape and freezing rate versus fraction solidified.  The influence of
              rotation rate on interface shape, and on qrain and twin formation and selection
              will be determined.  An instrumented cell will be constructed to simulate a
              gradient freeze growth ampoule. The cell will have a metal cooling plate on the
              bottom with a curved surface to simulate the solid liquid interface. Streak
              photographs of suspended particles will be taken with slit illumination. The
              thermal field will be determined using real time holographic interferometry.
              %%%  The primary goal of this program is to develop a fundamental understanding
              of the bulk crystal growth of electronic materials at high gravity and to apply
              this understanding to the manufacture of electronic materials to achieve
              improvements in microstructure and homogeneity.  An important feature of the
              program is the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically
              significant area of materials research.  This research will contribute to
              improving the general perform ance of advanced electronic and photonic devices
              and integrated circuits used in computing, information processing, and tele
              communica tions.  ***
