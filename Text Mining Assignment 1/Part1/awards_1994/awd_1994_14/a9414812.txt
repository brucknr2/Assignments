Abstract    :
              9414812  Prospero    The Objectives of AEROCE are centered around two themes: 
              the  oxidative capacity of the atmosphere and the impact of aerosols on 
              climate.       In order to attain these objectives or goals, it is necessary 
              to carry out long-term and shorter-term intensive measurements of  numerous
              chemical and physical properties of the atmosphere.  This  means that
              measurements must be made both in a continuous daily (or  even more frequent)
              fashion as well as periodically in an intensive  mode in important regions of
              the North Atlantic.  Such a  comprehensive data base is essential to attaining
              these goals and  to the creation and validation of models that can describe 
              atmospheric processes.  The rationales for the specific  measurements that will
              be made with samples collected in the AEROCE  network are presented in the
              individual scientific proposals.       The specific objectives of the AEROCE
              Network Operations Group  (NOG) are to :       1.  Establish and maintain
              atmospheric sampling stations at  selected locations in the North Atlantic
              region,       2.  Operate these atmospheric sampling stations so as to  provide
              high quality atmospheric samples and assist in the  operation of analytical
              instrumentation in support of AEROCE  research programs and secondarily, for
              guest investigators, and       3.  Collect and utilize meteorological data and
              condensation  particle concentration data on a continuous basis in
              collaboration  with and in support of other AEROCE investigators.
