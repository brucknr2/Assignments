Abstract    :
              9414424  Wu  This research project focuses on the development of an innovative 
              technique calculate transient as well as steady-state acoustic  radiation from
              an arbitrarily vibrating object moving in the  proximity of a solid, stationary
              surface. With this method,  engineers involved with the design of automotive
              components such  as side panels, hoods and oil pans are able to explore 
              alternative designs for minimizing the noise levels and  satisfying the pass-by
              noise requirements SAE J986, J1470 and  ECD51. The approach uses an explicit
              form of solution for the  radiated acoustic pressure in the frequency domain in
              terms of  the normal component of the velocity distribution on the surface  of
              an object via the Kirchhoff integral theory. The time-domain  signal is
              obtained using an inverse Fourier transformation. The  effect of sound
              scattering from a nearby solid, stationary  surface is accounted for by rising
              the image source method.  Although the technique is of immediate value to
              automotive  industry, its applicability is much broader since it deals with 
              acoustic radiation from an arbitrarily vibrating object.  ***
