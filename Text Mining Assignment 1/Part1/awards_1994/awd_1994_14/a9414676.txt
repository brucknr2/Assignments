Abstract    :
              9414676  Mathews  This is an awards to support research, the objective of which
              is  to utilize recent advances made in understanding of adsorption as  a unit
              process for removal of organic chemicals from water and  wastewater in
              improving the design of flow-through devices that  utilize adsorption as the
              effective process.  The investigator  feels that to sharpen the adsorption
              wave-front as it moves  through the adsorbing medium will be a significant step
              toward  improving the efficiency of treatment devices, the effectiveness  of
              which is based on use of adsorption as the operative  environmental technology.
               He plans on evaluating granular  activated carbon as the adsorption medium in
              reverse stratified  tapered adsorbers that have variable area bed
              configurations, the  packing arrangement of which is dependent on the direction
              of  liquid flow through the adsorbing and support media.    Adsorption is a
              unit process that has proven to be effective in  removing organic materials
              from aqueous suspension and solution.  Advances in fundamental understanding of
              the process provides the  potential basis for significant improvements in
              engineering  design of treatment devices and processes for improvement of the 
              process performance.  Results of this research are expected to  improve the
              engineering design of environmental technologies and  systems that utilize
              adsorption as the effective component of  their operation.  ***
