Abstract    :
              9414438  Goldfarb     The objectives of this research are the development,
              analysis, and   implementation of algorithms for solving mathematical
              programming   problems.  The focus of this project is on simplex algorithms,
              interior   point algorithms and algorithms that combine interior point and  
              multiplier penalty approaches, with particular emphasis on algorithms   that
              are efficient both in theory and in practice.  Specialized   algorithms for
              network flow problems and those that take advantage of   the architecture of
              massively parallel computers will be developed.      Since many problems in
              science and engineering can be formulated as   large-scale optimization
              problems, the development of efficient   optimization algorithms under this
              project will have an impact on fields   outside of optimization such as
              manufacturing (production planning and   scheduling), biotechnology (protein
              folding), civil infrastructure (fleet   and crew scheduling and transportation
              planning), and telecommunications   (network design and routing) as well as on
              the field of optimization itself.
