Abstract    :
                      9414804  Naganathan  This award is to demonstrate that motions of a few
              centimeters can  be performed by smart material actuator system.  A program
              that  combines theoretical investigations and experimental demonstrations  will
              be conducted.  Potential configurations made of piezoceramic  and
              electrostrictive materials will be evaluated for providing  larger motions at
              reasonable force levels for non-military  applications.  ***
