Abstract    :
              Abstract  ATM-9414381  Fritz, Sherilyn C.  University of Minnesota    This award
              supports the study of fossil diatom assemblages as 
              paleohydrological/paleoclimatic indicators in Moon Lake,a closed-  basin lake
              in the northern Great Plains.  This study will attempt  to reconstruct changes
              ineffective moisture (precipitation minus  evapotranspiration.  The historical
              relationship between diatom-  inferred salinity and climate will be used to
              calculate a transfer  function for effective moisture and hydrological drought
              (Palmer  Hydrological Drought Index) which will then be extended to the  entire
              post-glacial record.  Climatic conditions will be assessed  at century-scale
              resolution through the entire Holocene and at  decadal-scale resolution during
              three periods: the last glaciation-  deglaciation period, the early-Holocene
              forest/prairie transition,  and past 2000 years.  Paleoclimatic records from
              climatically  sensitive agricultural regions such as the Great Plains, where 
              little is known of past climate, and what is known is of a coarse  resolution,
              will provide a valuable contribution to the  understanding of climatic
              variability on local, regional, and  global scales.  Understanding drought
              characteristics through the  analysis of long-term trends in the paleoclimatic
              record will  provide valuable information for planning and managing water 
              shortages that may accompany future drought events.
