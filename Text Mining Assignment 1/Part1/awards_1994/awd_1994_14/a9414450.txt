Abstract    :
              9414450  Coleman  The objectives of this proposal are to study and develop high
              and low power continuously tunable millimeter and submillimeter wave lasers
              based upon Landau levels in semiconductors that are of interest to the Army
              Research Laboratory.  The initial study will be on bulk semiconductor materials
              (i.e., Ge,GaAs), excited by pulsed E field and dc B fields where E.B = 0.
              Numerous laser signals in the range 10-120cm-1 have been generated in pGe with
              E and B fields in the range 1-2 kV/cm and 0.5-2.0 tesla.  Specific objectives
              are to understand the laser dynamics and laser cycle by employing excited state
              spectroscopy using the numerous signals available from molecular lasers.  Laser
              efficiencies of 1-2% could readily yield kilowatts of pulsed power in a
              difficult range of the spectrum.  For low power applications, Landau levels in
              heterostructures will be investigated.  Practical sources above 100 GHz are
              difficult to achieve which makes it difficult to develop the
              millimeter-submillimeter region. The aim of this study is to contribute to this
              development.  The submillimeter range is a transition region from microwave  to
              optical techniques and as such offers the graduate student a broad education in
              field theory, quantum electronics, semiconductors, optics, spectroscopy and
              material  properties.  ***
