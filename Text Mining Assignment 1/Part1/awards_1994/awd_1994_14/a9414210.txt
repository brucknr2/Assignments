Abstract    :
              9414210  Zhang     The objective of this project is to develop effective
              multimedia computer-based courseware to teach and evaluate skills in computer
              literacy and to build an intelligent instructional design/authoring system: ID
              Expert/CS for efficiently developing and delivering multimedia computer-based
              instruction/training for computer technologies.      The courseware will
              include a set of modules: Computer Basics; Electronic Mail; Operating Systems;
              Library Information Systems; Internet, Bulletin Boards, and Networking; Word
              Processing; Data Visualization and Spreadsheets. With this courseware, students
              can learn from instructions, get help from on-line tutors, discuss learning
              experiences with fellow students, raise questions.  Students will be able to
              practice on both simulated as well as real computer systems and receive
              feedback on their performance. The course content and instructional strategies
              will be adaptive to individual students.       With ID Expert/CS, instructors
              will be able to customize the existing courseware to meet the needs of their
              students, to integrate new material into existing courseware, and to develop
              new courseware for computer technologies.      Successfully completion of this
              project will provide a means to significantly improve the quality of education
              and training for high school and college students as well as adults in the area
              of computers.  ***
