Abstract    :
              9414472  Bentsman  This International Cooperative Research Project involves 
              collaborative research effort between the PI and five  leading researchers from
              the Former Soviet Union (FSU)  countries. Innovative techniques are developed
              for the  control of mechanical systems subjected to energy and  magnitude
              constraints. Such control situations are  encountered in many diverse
              applications, e.g.,  reorientation and maneuvering of spacecrafts, and 
              positioning of robotic manipulators and flying heads in hard  disk drives. In
              this project, mathematical models are  formulated for complex nonlinear
              mechanical systems that  admit both impulsive and conventional control inputs. 
              Optimal solutions are generated under the integral and  magnitude constraints
              for this class of systems using a  generalized control approach in a
              closed-loop setting.  ***
