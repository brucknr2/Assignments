Abstract    :
              9414858  Weathers  This project is on research to study the culturing of plant 
              organs (hairy roots) by a NMB.  Also, methods to recover the  secondary
              metabolites produced by the plant organs which are not  lethal to the plants
              will be investigated.  The objectives of  this research are to: (1) develop and
              test mathematical models  for the key transport processes in the NMB; (2)
              conduct complete  growth cycle experiments using a fully instrumented NMB; (3) 
              measure the kinetics of growth and secondary metabolite  production in the NMB
              and compare these kinetics to that of other  reactors for the culture of hairy
              roots; and (4) develop, measure  and model non-lethal product release methods.
