Abstract    :
                9414310  Taylor    About once each day the BATSE experiment on the Compton
              Gamma Ray   Observatory measures a sudden short burst of energetic radiation.  
              The source of these gamma ray bursts is completely unknown.   Detection of
              bursts at radio wavelengths in addition to gamma  energies would provide a
              great deal of information on the sources.   The PI will attempt this using an
              automated radio telescope which  can search for a burst within five seconds of
              its detection by  BATSE.    ***
