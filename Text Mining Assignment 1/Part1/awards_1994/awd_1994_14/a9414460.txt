                    ABSTRACT  CTS-9414460  Rutgers University  P.I.:  Fernando Muzzio     
              Improved design and control of industrial  mixing operations could lead to the
              prevention of large amounts of waste.  Progress in the past has been hindered
              by the lack of quantitative descriptions of mixing processes.  The work
              conducted under this grant will consist of closely integrated experiments and
              direct numerical simulations.  The goal is to obtain a full description of the
              fluid mechanics in mixing processes, generating explicit information that can
              subsequently be used to optimize the performance of a reactive system.   
              Chaotic flows will be used as the starting point.  Initially work will be
              focused on the partitioned pipe mixer, which consists of a static set of planes
              located inside a pipe.  Reactive mixing experiments and computations will be
              conducted to investigate the effects of different mixing regimes on product
              distribution and waste production in industrially relevant reactions.  Over the
              course of this work, studies will be conducted both for low and high Reynolds
              number cases.
