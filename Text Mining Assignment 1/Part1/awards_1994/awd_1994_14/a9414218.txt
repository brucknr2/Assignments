Abstract    :
              9414218  Norton           ABSTRACT      This program is a manufacturing
              workforce retraining activity involving Weber State University in a highly
              integrated partnership with Utah Valley State College, Salt Lake Community
              College, and the Ogden/Weber and Mountainlands Advanced Technology Centers. 
              The objective is to provide proactive outreach, assistance, and interaction
              with small manufacturers and to develop short courses and delivery systems
              targeting personnel in defense-related and manufacturing industries in the
              inter mountain region of Utah, Idaho, and Wyoming.  It uses distance and
              interactive learning to overcome geographic dispersion of students and
              industries in the region.  Using the broadcast receiver from the University of
              Utah in an instructional TV partnership, this project seeks to improve
              information infrastructure for greater access to manufacturing knowledge.  The
              State of Utah has committed to build the computer trunk line to strengthen the
              necessary linkages among industry, academe, and regional authorities.  ***
