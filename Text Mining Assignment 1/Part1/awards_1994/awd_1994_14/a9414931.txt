Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the  
              Chemistry Division, Prof. Delroy Baugh of the Chemistry Department of the  
              University of California at Los Angeles will conduct experiments on the  
              state-to-state chemical reaction dynamics of ammonia and phosphine.  An  
              electrostatic-hexapole field will be used to prepare molecular beams of   these
              species in single, rotation-vibrational states that are completely   specified
              within the limits allowed by quantum mechanics.  The state   selected molecules
              are excited to an unstable potential energy surface   causing decay into
              fragments which are subsequently analyzed to yield   detailed differential
              cross sections for the reaction.      This resesrach is directed toward the
              determination of the potential   energy surface  which controls an elementary
              chemical reaction.    Molecules are initially prepared in well defined quantum
              states which   allow detailed tracking of the reaction process.  The
              experiments to be   performed are the first in which molecules other than
              hydrogen will be   subject of investigation of  complete state-to-state
              reaction dynamics.    The results of this work will play a significant role in
              validating   existing theories of chemical reactions on the molecular level.
