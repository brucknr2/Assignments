Abstract    :
              9414207  Robinson  This award will provide partial support for a symposium 
              entitled "Computational Intelligence: Imitating Life."  The  meeting is under
              the auspices of the IEEE World Congress on  Computational Intelligence, an
              activity of the Institute of  Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).   
              Computational Intelligence is an emerging field of inquiry  that lies at the
              boundary between engineering and science,  between biology and computers, and
              between observational  models and theoretical assumptions.  The meeting will
              bring  together international experts in discussions of the  critical
              technologies and issues relating to biologically,  psychologically, and
              linguistically motivated models that  exhibit various facets of computational
              intelligence.  The  symposium provides a unique forum for cross-fertilization 
              between the areas of neural networks, fuzzy logic, and  evolutionary computing.
                 Proceedings of the symposium are to be published, thereby  making results of
              the meeting available to a large audience.
