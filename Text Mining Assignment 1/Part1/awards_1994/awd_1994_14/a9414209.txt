Abstract    :
                9414209 Pollak   Fundamental research directed toward improved understanding
              of growth and processing of semiconductors, and the electronic properties of
              heterostructures through the development and use of advanced modulation
              spectroscopy, particularly photore flectance and electrore flectance, for an
              effective screening tool in the characterization of semiconductor device
              structures will be conducted.  The research base established will serve to
              improve materials parameters such as alloy composition, Schottky barrier
              heights, interfacial quality, and well width in quantum well structures and
              superlattices.   %%%   This research is expected to provide deeper fundamental
              understanding of semiconductor growth and processing, and the fundamental
              electronic properties of heterostructures.    A major advantage of the methods
              being developed is that they can be used in situ and in real time for effective
              improvement in the control of advanced semiconductor growth and subsequent
              processing as well as providing fundamental information on the basic electronic
              properties of these materials.   ***
