Abstract    :
                9414525  Sehitoglu  This research is primarily an experimental effort to
              further the  understanding of stress- and strain-induced phase transformations 
              under high pressures and cyclic loading in alloy steels.  Pressure  loading
              permits isolation of hydrostatic stress and principle  stress effects on
              transformations and produces homogeneous stress  fields allowing unambiguous
              interpretation of stress and strain  effects.  Cyclic loading modifies the
              internal structure and will  generate different transformation behavior
              compared to  unidirectional loading.  The development of constitutive models 
              based on a verified by well characterized experimental results is  a very high
              priority in the Mechanics and Materials Program.   Therefore, the experimental
              study of phase changes contained in  this proposal is very important for
              establishing the data base that  is required before the foundation for a strong
              theoretical  component can be established.  The proposed work will advance both
               the micro- and mechanical understanding of phase transformations in  material
              systems.  ***
