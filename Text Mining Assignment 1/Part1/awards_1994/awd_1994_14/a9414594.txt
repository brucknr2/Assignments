Abstract    :
              9414594  Pignatello  This is an award to provide support for research on an
              advanced  oxidation process for destruction of organic contaminants of  water
              and soil.  The process involves use of iron in the ferric  state,
              near-ultraviolet light radiation and hydrogen peroxide.  The objectives of this
              research are to study key features of the  inorganic and photochemical
              mechanisms that affect oxidation of  the target organic compounds and the
              applications of this  innovative environmental technology.  The investigator
              plans on  determining whether a hypervalent iron-oxo complex is formed 
              photochemically that supplements the action of the hydroxyl  radical in
              oxidation of organic compounds and expects to clarify  the role of ferric iron
              in this reaction.    The applications phase of this research will address the
              effect  of light intensity and temperature on the reaction rate, the  kinetics
              and pathways of degradation of organic substances  subjected to the process,
              the influence of common anions on the  reaction rate and the feasibility of a
              two stage system combining  this advanced oxidation process with a biological
              process for  treatment of water and soil contaminated with organic wood 
              preservatives.  Results of this project are expected to provide  the basis for
              considering its use in treatment of soil and water  that has been contaminated
              with organic substances of commercial,  industrial and agricultural
              significance.  ***
