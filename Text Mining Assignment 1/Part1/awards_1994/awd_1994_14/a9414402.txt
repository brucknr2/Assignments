Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              will assist the  Departments of Chemistry, Material Science, Physics and
              Mechanical Engineering at Rice  University acquire a SQUID Magnetometer.  This
              new instrumentation will greatly enhance  research in the following areas: 
              Dopyballs, Buckytubes, and Fullerene Fibers, Perpendicular  Magnetic Thin Film
              Studies, Magnetochemical studies in Bioinorganic Chemistry, and Main  Group
              Element/Transition Metal Compounds, Clusters and Phases.    Magnetism is a
              property of a material arising from the force exerted on a system by a magnetic
               body along with an electric field.  The SQUID is used to measure very small
              currents or  voltages, which is useful to the understanding of the behavior of
              materials.
