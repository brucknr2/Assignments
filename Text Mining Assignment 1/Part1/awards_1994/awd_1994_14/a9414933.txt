Abstract    :
              Johansen  Mayville State University, located in North Dakota, serves a small
              community in the  agrarian Red River Valley region of the State.  Built in
              1957, the Science Building,  housing the Chemistry Department, remains as
              initially constructed without any  modifications.  Currently dedicated research
              and research training facilities are  unavailable for faculty and students to
              pursue their research interests.  ARI funds, in  combination with State
              funding, will be used to convert a small laboratory, a dark  room and a
              chemical storage area, to dedicated research and research training space.  
              Electrical and plumbing systems will be upgraded and the ventilation system
              improved  to maintain the level of research activity.  In order to support
              experiments conducted  in the areas of organometallic, analytical, and physical
              chemistry, fume hoods and a  bench, measuring the length of the room, will be
              installed.  This renovation project is  integral to the Department s efforts in
              delivering a quality undergraduate research  program.  With  62% of the student
              population from small rural areas in eastern  North Dakota and western
              Minnesota, and approximately half of the students majoring  in chemistry are
              women, this project will have a significant impact on the  undergraduate
              research experience at Mayville State.
