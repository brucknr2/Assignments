Abstract    :
                      9414452  LARSON  The  Alaska Native community desires to become actively
               involved  in  scientific research. One way to achieve this is  through  the 
              establishment of a Native Science Commission. The purpose of this  workshop 
              proposal is to develop a number of processes which  can  facilitiate  
              collaboration  and  communication  between   Native  communities  and
              researchers in Alaska. Two workshops,  including  both international and Alaska
              experts, will be held to define the  scientific  framework  and organization 
              of  the  Native  Science  Commisssion.  The  long-term  goal is  to  improve 
              communication  between  the Native and scientific communities, to stimulate 
              the  use  of  indigenous knowledge in science, to contribute to Arctic 
              logistics, and to establish a process for approval of research in  Alaska.  ***
