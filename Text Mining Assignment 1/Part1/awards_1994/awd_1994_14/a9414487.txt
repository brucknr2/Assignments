Abstract    :
              9414487  Fourer       This research focuses on the identification and
              investigation  of difficult conceptual issues that must be resolved in
              designing  languages, interfaces, and algorithms for a broad classes of 
              combinatorial optimization problems.  The research aims to identify  strategies
              for transferring discrete optimization technology to a  broad range of users
              and to design general-purpose languages and  environment that support
              application development in discrete  optimization.  The foundation of the
              research is provided by two  system design elements, the algebraic modeling
              language and the  algebraic toolkit, that have been used in the development of 
              software in statistics and continuous optimization problems.  This  work will
              jointly consider the issue of representation and  algorithms in developing the
              general-purpose software for  combinatorial optimization.       The research
              will have direct practical value to engineering  education and the American
              industry.  American industries engage  daily in resolving problems that are
              combinatorial in nature.  The  outcome of this research will facilitate the
              ease of use of  explicit models and powerful optimization technologies to
              resolve  these problems.  Industry will also benefit from the quality  solution
              that can be obtained from the use of optimization models  as against heuristic
              algorithms.  From the engineering education  view point, development of a
              general-purpose modeling software will  play a key role in the teaching of
              large-scale optimization.  This  will allow student to formulate, solve, and
              analyze realistically  large and complex models instead of dealing with
              textbook type  problems that are generally small and contrived.
