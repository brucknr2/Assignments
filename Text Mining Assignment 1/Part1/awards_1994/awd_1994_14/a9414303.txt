Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  9414303  Filisko    Partial travel support will be provided to several
              invited speakers to participate at the Electrorheological (ER) Materials and
              Fluids Symposium, organized on  August 21-22, in Washington, D. C.  This
              meetings aims to promote advanced made in the specific field of  research  in
              the last few years, and to identify new opportunities.  The main topics to be
              discussed at the meeting are:  design and synthesis of ER materials components;
              basic physical mechanisms, effect of component properties on ER performance,
              and ER requirements for commercial applications.
