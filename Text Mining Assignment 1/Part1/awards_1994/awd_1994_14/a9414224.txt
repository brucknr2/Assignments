Abstract    :
              This award partially funds a conference covering topics in  analytic number
              theory organized by Professors Harold Diamond,  Bruce Berndt, and Adolf
              Hildebrand.  This international  conference will be held May 1994 at the
              University of Illinois'  Allerton Park Conference Center.  The conference will
              feature  talks by world leaders in analytic number theory and include 
              presentations of the latest work of other mathematicians.   The field of
              analytic number theory applies the techniques of  calculus to the discrete
              realm of the whole numbers.  Calculus  was developed to aid the analysis of
              continuous mathematical  objects.  The idea of using continuous methods to
              investigate  discrete objects is two centuries old, but with the work of the 
              modern analytic number theorists, the field has had a new  rebirth.
