Abstract    :
              9414122  Beasley    The objective of this research is the simultaneous
              measurement ,  using sounding balloons, of electric field and x-ray fluxes in 
              selected thunderstorms.  The observations will be made during the  verification
              of the Origins of Rotation in Tornados Experiment  (VORTEX) and should benefit
              from the additional meteorological  measurements intended for VORTEX.
