Abstract    :
              9414144  Rickett    Drs. Rickett and Coles will study the scattering of
              radiowavelength radiation  as it passes through the interstellar plasma.  The
              motivation for the research  is twofold: first to understand the scattering and
              so predict the distorting  effects of interstellar wave propagation for radio
              astronomers; second to  record the distortions and scattering and to interpret
              them as a way of  studying the distant ionized interstellar medium.  In the
              first case the  scattering causes a galactic seeing problem for radio
              astronomers; in the  second case the details of the scattering provide a signal
              which can be used  to remotely probe the characteristics of the very diffuse
              interstellar plasma.
