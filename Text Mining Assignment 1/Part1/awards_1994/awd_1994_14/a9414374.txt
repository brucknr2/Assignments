Abstract    :
              9414374  Bras  A Workshop on Sustainable Development in Urban Areas of the 
              Americans will take place in Santiago, Chile, April 5-9, 1994.  The purpose of
              this meeting is to bring an eclectic  interdisciplinary group of experts to
              develop the research agenda  necessary to define the concept of sustainable
              development within  the context of urban areas in various parts of the Americas
              where  natural resources, environmental and economic conditions, and  other
              factors are distinct for each country and may influence  their urban systems
              sustainability.  One beneficial result from  this meeting is the development of
              joint research projects  between United States and other American countries for
              the  improvement of the knowledge base related to the healthy growth  of urban
              sites.  ***
