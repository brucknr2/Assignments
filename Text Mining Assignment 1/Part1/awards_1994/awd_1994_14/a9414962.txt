Abstract    :
              The Antarctic Research Series, begun by AGU in 1963 with the  aid of a grant
              from the National Science Foundation,  publishes the results of all aspects of
              Antarctic research.  Volumes have provided extensive and authoritative reports
              of  research results in marine and terrestrial biology, marine  geology and
              geophysics, solid Earth geophysics,  geochemistry, oceanic and atmospheric
              studies, glaciology,  and geology and paleontology.  These volumes are designed
              to  serve working scientists, students, and laymen interested in  biological or
              physical research endeavors in Antarctica and  on the occasion, the lay public
              interest in the Antarctic  environment.  The primary purpose is to provide an
              effective  and authoritative outlet for research conducted in  Antarctica. 
              Much of the research is conducted under the  U.S. Antarctic Program.  Thematic
              volumes are devoted to a  single topic or occasionally a particular geographic
              area.  In soliciting, reviewing, and selecting papers for  publication,
              particular attention is paid to ensuring the  quality of the series.  To date,
              over 15,000 pages have been  published in 62 volumes and a special collection
              of papers  in Reviews of Geophysics.  An additional ~ 1000 pages are in  press.
               The series is recognized the scientific and library  communities, who look to
              it to provide continuing access to  south polar results.  The AGU Board of
              Associates Editors  for the Antarctic Research Series has expanded the modes of
               publication and continues to monitor the needs of the  research community. 
              The Board also recognizes NSF's growing  desire to disseminate results from
              Antarctic research to the  educated public and has agreed to investigate the 
              possibility of publishing a volume that describes the  Antarctic environment,
              integrates the various dynamic  systems, and assesses interactions and
              influences on the  global environment.
