Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9414584  Faghri     The most important characteristics of
              evaporators and condensers which are needed to meet the thermal management
              requirements of emerging technologies are high heat flux capabilities,
              compactness and low thermal and hydraulic resistances. Several evaporator and
              condenser configurations with some new design features are proposed for
              theoretical and experimental analyses to meet these requirements. The goal of
              these efforts is to gain a fundamental understanding of the heat transfer
              processes in these proposed high efficiency evaporators and condensers, which
              are useful for various industrial and scientific applications.
