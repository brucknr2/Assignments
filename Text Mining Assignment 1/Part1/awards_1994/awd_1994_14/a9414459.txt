Abstract    :
              9414459  Wilbur  The effects on tribological performance of high density ion 
              implantation at low energies of oxygen, carbon, boron and  nitrogen into tool
              steels will be studied.  The research is  a cooperative effort which involves
              the Colorado State  University, the Physical Technical Institute in Minsk, 
              Belarus, and Hughes Company Research Laboratories.  The dose  and implantation
              conditions which induce maximum resistance  to sliding wear in commercial tool
              steels will be  identified, and the mechanisms of deep diffusion at high 
              implantation rates will be studied. Tribological test  results will be compared
              with microstructural and surface  analytical results obtained by a number of
              complementary  techniques.  ***
