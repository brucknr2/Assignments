Abstract    :
              9414669  Soileau  An innovative, geographically diverse Alliance has been formed
              of  educational institutions, industrial companies and a photonics 
              professional society.  This Alliance will establish and deliver a  new training
              program on the use of photonics technologies, tools,  and systems in the
              manufacturing workplace.  Photonics is the  program focus because it is a broad
              enabling technology for modern  manufacturing, the basis for an emerging global
              industry, and a  pervasive technology in modem warfare.  This program will help
               assimilate earlier government investment in photonics into the  manufacturing
              economy by providing skilled workers for a multitude  of dual-use applications.
               The program targets displaced defense  industry engineers, former members of
              the armed forces, and  manufacturing engineers in the commercial and defense
              sectors.   Curricula will be developed and delivered jointly by 
              representatives from industry and academia, and will consist of  intensive
              two-week classroom/laboratory courses.  Courses will be  held at established
              academic and industrial sites, and long-  distance training opportunities such
              as videotaped courses and  live, interactive video will be pursued.  ***
