Abstract    :
              9414269  Thompson             Abstract      A Practice-Oriented Computational
              Simulation Masters Degree Program in Design and Manufacturing    Working with
              its industrial partners, particularly the Boeing Commercial Airplane Group,
              Silicon Graphics Computer Systems, and IBM, the Engineering Research Center
              (ERC) for Computational Field Simulation at the Mississippi State University
              proposes to establish a Practice-Oriented MS Degree Program for Computational
              Simulation in Design and Manufacturing designed to incorporated director
              industrial input and applications into the graduate program.  With the
              Industrial Advisory Board serving as the overseer, the program targets graduate
              students in engineering and computer science departments, with participation
              from mathematics.  Using state-of-the-art computer facilities, it emphasizes
              cross-disciplinary development of computer simulation skills and requires
              summer residency by the students hosted by industrial partners.  It also
              interacts with regional institutions to recruit women and underrepresented
              minorities into the program.  ***
