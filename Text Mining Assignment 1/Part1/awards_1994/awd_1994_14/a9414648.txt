Abstract    :
              9414648  Phillips  This research centers around three objectives.  First, the 
              traditional Peierls model of dislocation mobility is reassessed in  light of
              atomistic calculations.  Secondly, a new experimental  technique for measuring
              directly the interplanar shear potential is  examined from the point of view of
              atomistic calculations of the  interplanar potential.  Finally a new scheme for
              bringing together  atomistic simulation and continuum methods is explored. 
              This will  allow for the use of finite-element calculations outside of their 
              usual province of applicability in order to study problems of  dislocation
              mobility.  The unifying theme of the research is the  examination of factors
              governing the structure and mobility of  single dislocations in a way that
              allows the results to be tied  directly to experimentally accessible
              quantities, i.e., bring  together atomistic and continuum approaches for the
              treatment of  dislocation structure and dynamics.  ***
