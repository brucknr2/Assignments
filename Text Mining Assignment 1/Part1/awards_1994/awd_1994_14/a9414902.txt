Abstract    :
              Renovation and replacement of approximately 20,000 square feet of biology,
              neuroscience  and psychology laboratory space is the goal of this NSF award to
              Amherst College.   Existing laboratories are housed in the 139-yr. old Appleton
              and 83-yr. old Webster Halls.   Partially renovated in the 1960s, these
              buildings still suffer from outdated and ineffective  HVAC, plumbing and
              electrical systems.  Ongoing facility issues include the limitation of  modern
              science, periodic systems crises which interrupt and setback experimentation,
              and  programmatic limitations due to the separation of disciplines.  NSF funds
              will be utilized  to renovate the first floor of Webster Hall for dry
              laboratory activities associated with the  Psychology department, and for the
              replacement of wet laboratory facilities for  Neuroscience and Biology in an
              addition to Merrill Science Center.  The resulting  enhancement to research
              facilities will advance the interdisciplinary connections (biology,  chemistry,
              psychology, and neuroscience) that will characterize science research and 
              teaching during the next half-century.  The upgraded facilities will also form
              an important  focus for Amherst's successful efforts to involve a high number
              of their undergraduates --  40% of whom are women and 25% of whom are students
              of color -- in research activity   The research emphasis gained at Amherst has
              motivated more than half of their honors  students to pursue Ph.D. programs, or
              M.D. programs with research as a substantial  component of their medical school
              education.
