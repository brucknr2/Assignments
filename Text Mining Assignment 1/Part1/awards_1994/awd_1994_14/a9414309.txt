Abstract    :
              9414309  Kurtz     Louisiana Tech University will develop an entirely new
              sophomore-level course on parallel and distributed computing and five knowledge
              units designed to be added to existing courses in the upper division
              curriculum.  The early introduction of concurrency will allow the transfer of
              current research results into upper division courses.  Instructional support
              materials including sample lecture notes, laboratory manuals, software, and
              multimedia aids will be produced.  In particular, an extensive software
              environment for the new sophomore-level course where students will be able to
              experiment with the various methods of concurrency and different connection
              topologies will be developed.  A CD-ROM disk for instructors that will
              introduce them to the various public domain software packages already available
              over the Internet will be provided as well as advice on using these packages in
              their courses, and sample problems and solutions.     Louisiana Tech has also
              solicited the participation of Grambling State University (GSU).  Faculty from
              GSU will participate in the development of course materials.  These materials
              will be designed so that they can be used in Computer Science programs at a
              wide variety of schools.  There will be no dependency on having a massively
              parallel computer; rather, simulations of parallel architectures will be used. 
              Distributed processing over local area networks will also be stressed.  Course
              materials will be tested at both Louisiana Tech and Grambling.  Collaboration
              with the University of Central Florida has also been arranged.  ***
