Abstract    :
              9414615   Sahinidis   This award provides funding for research toward an
              algorithm for finding global solutions to nonconvex, nonlinear problem (NLPs)
              and mixed-integer problems (MINLPs).  The approach is based on the solution of 
              a sequence of convex underestimating subproblems generated by evolutionary
              subdivision of the search region.  The key components of the algorithm are new
              optimality-based and feasibility-based range reduction tests.  The former use
              known feasible solutions and perturbation results to exclude inferior parts of
              the search region from consideration, while the latter analyze constraints to
              obtain valid inequalities.  The algorithm integrates these devices with an
              efficient local search heuristic.      Nonlinear optimization is often useful
              in engineering design for the selection of design parameters.  If successful,
              the  algorithm could enable more optimal designs to be found more rapidly and
              at lower cost.
