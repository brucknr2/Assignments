Abstract    :
              The proposed research will extend the Hawaii MF radar data set  (compiled since
              September, 1990) and provide for its analysis in  several collaborative efforts
              with other instrumentation and  scientists.  MF radar data, available for all
              CADRE measurement  campaigns and the ALOHA-93 campaign, will also provide an
              extended  overlap with data from similar radars at other locations.  Possible 
              studies address topics ranging from gravity wave propagation,  filtering, and
              forcing of the middle atmosphere to tidal and two-  day modulation and
              interactions.
