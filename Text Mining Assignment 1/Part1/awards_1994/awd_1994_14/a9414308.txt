Abstract    :
              This RUI award supports development of standard cell library of  high frequency
              analog CMOS telecommunication circuits in 2.0, 1.2  and 0.8 micron
              technologies.  Design and evaluation data on the  library cells will be
              included with the library.  The entire  library and evaluation data will be
              made available to interested  investigators over Internet.  It is expected that
              the project will  provide support to wireless research research community, as
              well as  students, in the area or analog circuitry.
