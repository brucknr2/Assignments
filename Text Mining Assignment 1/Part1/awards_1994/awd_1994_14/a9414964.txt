Abstract    :
               The University of Northern Iowa (UNI), as part of its increased emphasis on
              undergraduate and graduate research in the sciences,  will join with NSF to
              fund the renovation of five research laboratories and a chemical stockroom in
              McCollum Science Hall.  McCollum was constructed in 1967 and has  not undergone
              any significant renovation in its 28 years of use.  The proposed renovation
              will address improvements in four general areas: the integrated environmental
              chemistry and biology research areas, chemistry research areas, the chemistry
              computer laboratory, and the chemical stockroom.  Renovations will include an
              upgrade of utilities, installation of new benches, and upgrades to the air
              handling system to address safety and fire code violations and to provide a
              modern research facility.   Undergraduate education is the primary mission of
              the University of Northern Iowa, and the Chemistry and Biology Departments
              which will benefit from this award represent two of the strongest undergraduate
              research departments on the university campus.  The Biology Department is a
              rapidly growing department with over 500 undergraduate majors with plans for
              careers in biotechnology, teaching and post-graduate studies in biology and
              health-related sciences.  The Chemistry Department has over 120 undergraduate
              majors and prepares students for advanced study in science and medicine,
              teaching, and work in government and industrial laboratories.  Both departments
              have recently established an environmental science emphasis in their respective
              B.S. degree programs and have jointly established an M.S. Environmental Science
              program.  The facilities award will directly benefit twenty-two students and
              nine faculty in research activities encompassing organic electrochemistry,
              environmental biotechnology, atmospheric assessment of fuel additives,
              synthesis of natural product antibiotics, and the effects of pesticides and
              industrial effluents in aquatic ecosystems.
