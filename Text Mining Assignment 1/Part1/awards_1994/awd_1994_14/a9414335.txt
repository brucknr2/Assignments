Abstract    :
              9414335  Bucksbaum  This proposal to study, "High Intensity Laser-Atom and
              Molecule  Interactions", is for research into the behavior of atoms and 
              molecules under the high optical fields associated with high  intensity lasers.
               Under such conditions the systems become  highly non-linear and by using very
              short pulse durations  (compared to natural decay times) coherent control can
              be  exercised on the electron states.  The proposal will examine the  role of
              coherence in atomic and molecular stabilization, study  control in autoionizing
              and field-ionizing systems, and study  recently proposed connections between
              strong field phenomena such  as ATI and high harmonic generation, and classical
              scattering  models.  ***
