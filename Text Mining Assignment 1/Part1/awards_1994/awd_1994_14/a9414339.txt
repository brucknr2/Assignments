Abstract    :
                      9414339  Chang  This combined theory-experimental program is to study
              impact-  induced damage in composite structures.  A damage detection  technique
              based on structural vibratory response to locally  controlled excitations will
              be used.  This methodology requires the  integration of sensors and actuators
              into the design of the  structure.  They are interconnected to form a network
              of multiple  element units.  The development of the technique involves the 
              selection of the excitation signals, damage identification method  and
              development of the diagnostic element units.  ***
