Abstract    :
               Trinity University and the National Science Foundation will jointly support the
              renovation of facilities devoted to Laser Spectroscopy, Atmospheric Chemistry,
              and Capillary Electrophoresis and Chromatography in the Marrs McLean Science
              Center.  The renovation will substantially upgrade the current facilities,
              built in 1953 and 1959, to meet the challenges of contemporary science.  The
              NSF-funded effort will be part of an estimated $5 Million renovation of the
              entire science center undertaken by the institution.   All three laboratory
              spaces will be completely renovated including demolition of existing
              non-bearing walls, provision of new electrical ground and filtered electrical
              power lines, installation of new HVAC and back-up air conditioners for
              essential climate control, installation of computer network and telephone
              ports, shielding from elecro-magnetic interference (Laser Spectroscopy Lab), a
              new fume hood, deionized water system and vacuum system (Atmospheric Chemistry
              Lab), and a new fume hood and vacuum, compressed air and natural gas lines
              (Capillary Electrophoresis and Chromatography Lab).  The renovation will also
              permit the re-design of laboratory bench space for increased efficiency in
              research operations.   The completed effort will encourage student discovery of
              contemporary science and assure a much safer and efficient environment in which
              to work.  It will facilitate new experiments which have not been conducted
              previously at Trinity.  Trinity is highly ranked nationally on its programs in
              undergraduate science, mathematics and engineering education.  It seeks to
              include geographic distribution of students and to include under-represented
              minorities and women who constitute in excess of 10% and 44% respectively in
              these programs.
