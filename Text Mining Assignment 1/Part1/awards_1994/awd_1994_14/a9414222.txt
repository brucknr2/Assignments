Abstract    :
              9414222  Bardet  Twenty-three years following the 1971 Sylmar Earthquake, the 
              January 17, 1994 Northridge, CA, earthquake again caused  substantial damage to
              earth structures, water pipe systems, and  electrical equipment at the Van
              Norman facilities operated by the  Department of Water and Power (DWP) of Los
              Angeles.  The daily  observations of the University of Southern California
              (USC)  reconnaissance team and the interaction between the USC  reconnaissance
              team and the DWP revealed a wealth of geotechnical  data which can be used to
              advance earthquake hazard mitigation  procedures.  The objective of this
              project is to record and  disseminate this important but perishable
              information.    This data includes sandboils, a sink hole, large-scale ground 
              cracking, piping caused by liquefaction and lateral earth  spreading.  Since
              1971, the DWP facilities have been well  instrumented with strong motion
              instruments.  During the  Northridge earthquake, very large ground
              accelerations were  recorded inside and around the Van Norman facilities.  The
              goal  of this project is to assemble a complete data set on the effects  of
              strong ground shaking on liquefiable soils and earth  structures.  ***
