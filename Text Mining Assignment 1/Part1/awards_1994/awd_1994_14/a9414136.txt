Abstract    :
              9414136  Kennedy  The focus of this research is the development of several 
              methods for the preparation of heavily substituted  cyclopropanes.  All methods
              involve the use of hexasubstituted  pyrazoles as precursors to the desired
              systems.  %%%  With this Minority Research Initiation award, the Division of 
              Chemistry is supporting the research of Dr. G. Davon Kennedy of  the Department
              of Chemistry at Georgia State University.  Professor Kennedy will focus his
              work on developing methods for  the preparation of a class of organic compounds
              known as  cyclopropanes.  These compounds have use as synthetic  intermediates
              and they appear in a number of natural products.
