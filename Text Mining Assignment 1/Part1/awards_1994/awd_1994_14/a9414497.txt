Abstract    :
              9414497  Boland    This Americas Program award funds dissertation enhancement 
              research by Mr. John C. Marchelya, under the supervision of  Dr. John J. Boland
              and Dr. M. Patricia Fernandez-Kelly of  Johns Hopkins University. The project
              intends to develop a  decision framework for improving environmental protection
              in  an economically optimal manner. Their study will investigate  the practice
              of regulatory enforcement of industrial air  pollution in Mexico City and
              determine the informational,  political and social context.  The framework is
              based on  decision variables of the two agents considered most  responsible for
              retarding or advancing environmental  protection:  a profit-maximizing polluter
              and an  environmental enforcement agency. Insight on their  interaction, their
              decision variables and the context in  which such interaction is embedded is
              gained from theory  addressing: (1) investment, (2) law enforcement, (3) game 
              theory and (4) economic sociology.        This research will provide insights
              and conclusions  important to improved environmental quality in Mexico, which 
              is pertinent to the economic security of the U.S.  The  differences in
              environmental standards between the two  countries provide a competitive
              advantage to those  industries located in areas that have weak enforcement. 
              Regulatory enforcement thus becomes an important issue that  affects the
              competitive balance between the two countries.        ***
