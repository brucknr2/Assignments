Abstract    :
              Mattingly  9414716  Bioplastic (biofilm) coatings or biogenic varnishs are
              natural  accretions present on ancient, stable surfaces.  These biofilms are 
              from one to 500 micrometers thick and are produced by an apparent  symbiotic
              activity between Lichnothelia fungi and bacteria  resembling the
              Rhodococcus-Actinomycetes group.  It requires  hundreds of years for this
              symbiosis to create a continuous coating  over a stable surface.  Four
              different types of Lichenothelia-  associated varnishs have been identified
              based on chemical  differences and include (1) desert varnish, (2) soil
              varnish, (3)  temple varnish, and (4) tomb varnish.  No less than twenty 
              different species of Lichenothelia have been described associated  with biofilm
              formation.  However, neither the role of the fungus  nor associated bacteria is
              understood in forming the bioplastic  coatings.  Therefore, the goal of this
              NSF-SGER proposal is to: (1)  establish the identity of the genus and species
              of fungi and  bacteria involved in biofilm deposition on selected ancient 
              artifacts by using molecular biological techniques, (2) determine  the nature
              of the fungal/bacterial symbiotic association and (3)  determine the
              biochemistry of bioplastic coat formation.  %%%  Many ancient artifacts are
              covered by plastic coats, or films.   These plastic coatings are very thin and
              can take thousands of  years to form.  They are apparently produced
              biologically by the  concerted action of certain types of fungi and bacteria
              which are  able to colonize and grow together on stable, solid surfaces.  It is
              believed that the cellular biofilm-forming center is  comprised of a fungus
              called Lichenothelia and a bacterium, that  may be a Rhodococcus or Actinomyces
              type cell.  The goal of the  present NSF-SGER proposal is therefore to: (1)
              find out what types  of fungal and/or bacterial cells are involved in biofilm
              formation,  (2) to determine if the different cell types have to live together 
              to form the biofilm, and (3) learn about the chemistry of bio film  forming
              pathway.  ***
