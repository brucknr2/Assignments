Abstract    :
              9414666  Raber  This award, made to the National Academy of Sciences, will 
              provide continuing support for the core activities of the Board  of Chemical
              Sciences and Technology (BCST). The BCST will plan  and develop new projects
              germane to the broad chemistry  community, will provide oversight of ongoing
              studies, and will  provide liason between federal agencies, universities and
              the  private sector on matters of broad interest to chemistry and  chemical
              engineering.    Support of BCST activities will ensure that the chemistry 
              community has a credible and independent entity representing  it's interests
              across all levels of government, academia, and  the private sector.
