Abstract    :
               Gustavus Adolphus College is the recipient of funds from the National Science
              Foundation's Academic Research Infrastructure Program to renovated research
              space in the Nobel Hall of Science in support of the departments of chemistry
              and biology. This project is one element of a multi-phase effort to fortify the
              research-based science education at the College. NSF funding will contribute to
              the upgrade of mechanical, electrical and life-safety systems, and modernizing
              and reconfiguring of 5,226 square feet (578 square meters) of research space.
              The facility has never has been renovated since the building opened in 1963. 
              The deteriorating condition of Nobel Hall compromises Gustavus' ability to
              maintain and expand research programs.  Improved space chemistry will encompass
              laboratories in analytical, inorganic, organic and quantitative chemistry and
              materials science, as well as support facilities.  Modernized facilities in
              biology will include laboratories in freshwater and cell biology, supporting
              instrumentation and animal rooms, and a glasshouse with growth chambers for
              plant physiology and ecology.
