Abstract    :
              This project will continue the acquisition and archiving of  polar orbiting
              satellite images of the Antarctic  environment by the Arctic and Antarctic
              Research Center  (AARC) at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography for two 
              years.    Satellite tracking facilities have been established by the  AARC at
              McMurdo and Palmer Station, Antarctica, which  record and archive images from
              the NOAA series of polar  orbiting satellites and from the Department of
              Defense DMSP  series of satellites.  The AARC presently maintains an  archive
              of more than 14,000 satellite overpasses and the  regional coverage includes
              all of Antarctica and much of  the Southern Ocean.  These data are used to
              support such  Antarctic operational activities as the navigation of  research
              vessels in Antarctic waters and weather  forecasting for air operations, as
              well as the geophysical  and environmental research projects of polar
              scientists  worldwide.  ***
