Abstract    :
              9414221  Loufas   The American Indian Higher Education Consortium (AIHEC) is
              composed of the Native American tribal colleges and colleges managed by
              government agencies which serve primarily the Native American peoples.  This
              project provides travel support so that AIHEC college faculty can attend the

              participants and follow up activities are also planned.  ***
