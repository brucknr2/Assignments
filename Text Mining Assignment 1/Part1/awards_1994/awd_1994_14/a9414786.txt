Abstract    :
                    9414786  Ayorinde  This project is to provide the theoretical analysis of
              the role of  vibration assistance in the liquid molding of composites 
              manufacturing process.  It is complementary to a new experimental  program
              being funded by the Automotive Composites Consortium.   Vibration assistance
              has the potential to improve a basis for  optimization.  This project should
              assist in providing a better  understanding of the role of vibration assisted
              manufacturing in  general and the liquid molding composite fabrication process
              in  particular.  ***
