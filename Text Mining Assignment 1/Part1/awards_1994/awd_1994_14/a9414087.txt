Abstract    :
              9414087  Dormady  Jacksonville University requests support from NSF for
              connection  of its campus network to SURAnet.  SURAnet is the midlevel  network
              located in the southeastern United States.  It will  provide operations
              management and information services and it  will provide Jacksonville
              University with a 56 thousand bits per  second connection to the NSFNET, a high
              speed (1.5 - 45 million  bits per second) National Backbone network.    The
              University needs greater functionality and network speed to  be able to access
              supercomputers, libraries, and make file  transfers along with being able to
              implement a more reliable mail  system. Students and faculty research will
              benefit from the link.   This is also a unique opportunity for the school to
              explore  innovative educational resources.
