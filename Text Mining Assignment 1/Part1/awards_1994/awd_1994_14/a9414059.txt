Abstract    :
              9414059  Huband and Leake    This award supports a planning visit to China by a
              delegation under  the sponsorship of the American Society for Engineering
              Education  to investigate and define opportunities for US-China collaboration 
              in engineering education, with an emphasis on accreditation  policies,
              standards, and practices.  In addition to the importance  of developing a more
              comprehensive relationship among the  engineering education communities of the
              two countries, this visit  may influence the Chinese to adopt US engineering
              education  standards - based on a four year undergraduate degree - rather than 
              the 5.5 year German standard.  This is of importance for US  engineering firms
              hoping to do business in China, since the  standards selected by the Chinese
              government could exclude US-  trained engineers.  Opportunities for expanded
              cooperation in other  mutually beneficial areas of engineering education will
              also be  discussed.
