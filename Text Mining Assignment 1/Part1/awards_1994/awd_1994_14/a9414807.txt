Abstract    :
                  9414807  Gupta  This research will determine the failure mechanisms in
              laminated  carbon-carbon and carbon-polymer composites under biaxial 
              compression and off-axis uniaxial compression loading using a  multi-axial
              testing system (MATS) which can triaxially load a  specimen in three mutually
              perpendicular directions.  A primary  focus will be to determine the failure
              mechanisms experimentally  rather than just obtain the failure strength data
              and its empirical  dependence on various microstructural parameters. 
              Concomitant  failure laws will be developed which are based on the
              participation  of the experimentally determined failure mechanisms on final 
              instability.  The developed micro mechanism-based failure laws  should aid
              laminate manufactures produce optimum microstructure in  laminate composites.
