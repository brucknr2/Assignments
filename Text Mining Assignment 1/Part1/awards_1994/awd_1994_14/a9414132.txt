Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry   Division,
              Prof. Curt Wittig of the University of Southern California will   investigate
              fundamental chemical reaction processes.  In particular,   resonances that
              decay via competing decomposition pathways will be   examined using the nitrate
              radical as a prototype system.  Additionally,   double resonance techniques
              will be used for the first time in such   investigations involving weakly bound
              complexes.  This will allow the   unequivocal identification of the complexes
              in which the reactions are   photoinitiated.  Complexes such as carbonyl
              sulfide-hydrogen bromide and   water-carbon monoxide will be considered as
              prototype systems.     The goal of these investigations is a better
              understanding of chemical   reactions on a molecular level.  The results of
              this work will be   quantitative, mechanistic data  which will serve as
              benchmarks against   which theoretical models  of reaction chemistry can be
              tested.
