Abstract    :
              9414510  Anderson  This proposal describes a three-year research plan directed
              toward  the experimental demonstration of GaN-based short-wavelength 
              semiconductor injection lasers and the investigation of several key  scientific
              and technological issues related to laser applications  of the III-V nitrides. 
              Strong initial emphasis will be placed on  the demonstration of A1GaN/GaN/InGaN
              vertical-cavity surface-  emitting laser (VCSEL) structures grown on 6H-SiC
              substrates,  although a broad range of material and device design issues 
              directly relevant to GaN-based heterostructure lasers and other  devices will
              be investigated throughout the course of the project.   Theoretical and
              experimental work will encompass growth and  characterization of GaN, InGaN,
              and A1GaN epilayers and  heterostructures, heterostructure modeling, and VCSEL
              laser  modeling, design, fabrication, and characterization.  Epitaxial  growth,
              structural characterization, and electrical  characterization will be carried
              out by researchers at Advanced  Technology Materials, Inc.  (ATMI) of Danbury,
              CT, who are  currently involved in the development of GaN-based semiconductors 
              and will be full collaborators on this project.  This proposal is  being
              submitted for consideration as an Industry-University  Cooperative Research
              Project (IUCRP) under the NSF's Grant  Opportunities for Academic Liaisons with
              Industry (GOALI) program.  ***
