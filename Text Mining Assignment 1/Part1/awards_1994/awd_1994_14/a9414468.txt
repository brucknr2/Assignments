Abstract    :
              9414468  Walker    Obstacles encountered in designing low noise, high
              efficiency,  heterodyne receivers and local oscillator (LO) sources at 
              submillimeter wavelengths include the quality and cost of  waveguide
              structures.  At wavelengths shorter than 400 um,  rectangular waveguide
              structures, feedhorns, and backshorts  become prohibitively difficult to
              fabricate using standard  machining techniques.  Silicon micro-machining
              techniques will be  used to fabricate high quality waveguide structures and 
              components for use at submillimeter wavelengths.  The objective  of this
              project is to develop the technology necessary to  construct high efficiency,
              low-cost heterodyne array receivers  and signal sources which operate into the
              terahertz frequency  range.  Silicon laser etching will be demonstrated by 
              constructing and testing silicon micromachined waveguide mixer  arrays for use
              at 492 and 850 GHz.  These arrays will be built in  collaboration with the Max
              Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy.  ***
