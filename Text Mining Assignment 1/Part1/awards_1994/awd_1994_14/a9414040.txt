Abstract    :
                      9414040  Thomashow  This award provides partial financial support for
              the 1995 Gordon  Research Conference on Temperature Stress in Plants.  The
              meeting  will be held at the Casa Sirena Marina Hotel, Oxnard, California, 
              January 29 - February 3, 1995.  Funds will be used to defray the  expenses of
              junior scientists (graduate students and postdoctoral  researchers), and
              invited speakers.    The 1995 Gordon Research Conference on Temperature Stress
              in Plants  will be the sixth meeting of the conference; it was first held in 
              1984, and since 1989, has met on a biennial basis.  The overall  goal of the
              conference is to foster the exchange of ideas and  research findings among a
              diverse group of scientists studying  plant temperature stress from a wide
              variety of perspectives.   Scientists who attend this meeting include
              agronomists,  horticulturists, plant breeders, ecologists, plant physiologists,
               biochemists, biophysicists and molecular biologists who are  affiliated with
              universities, private and governmental research  laboratories, and commercial
              companies from both North America and  overseas.      As in the past, the 1995
              Gordon Conference will include sessions  covering the latest developments in
              fundamental aspects of plant  temperature stress (e.g., temperature stress
              proteins, temperature  signal transduction, whole plant responses to
              temperature stress,  breeding for increased temperature stress tolerance).  In
              addition,  the 1995 conference will have two novel features.  One will be the 
              development of a particular theme over the course of the meeting:  the role of
              membranes in temperature stress tolerance.  The  objective is to explore the
              current state of knowledge of the  regulation and function of plant
              phospholipids and potential  strategies to modify phospholipid composition to
              improve the  temperature stress tolerance of plants.  The other novel aspect 
              will be the inclusion of a "cross-over" session examining the  similarities and
              differences in mechanisms of temperature  and  drought tolerance.  This session
              will involve presentations by  investigators working on tolerance to drought
              and desiccation and  provide a bridge to plant scientists working in related
              areas of  environmental stress, but outside of temperature per se.  ***
