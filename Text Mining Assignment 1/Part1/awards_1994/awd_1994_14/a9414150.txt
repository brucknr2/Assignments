Abstract    :
              9414150  Wangemann       This award supports the IEEE/LEOS Summer Topical
              Meeting on  Optical Networks and Their Enabling Technologies  This is a forum 
              to present and examine recent developments in optical networks and  in devices
              and subsystems which will be required for their  successful implementation.
              This meeting is especially designed to  bring together researchers in each of
              these research areas.  Topics  will include optical networks based on switching
              or on time-,  wavelength-, or code-division multiple access techniques; 
              architectures and protocols for optical networks, end-user  applications for
              optical networks, experimental results from  optical network testbeds or field
              trials, implications of optical  devices on network performance, optical
              switches and  switching  fabrics, optical amplifiers and amplifier-based
              photonic circuits,  tunable transmitters and receivers, transmitter and
              receiver  arrays; wavelength and high-speed multiplexing devices and 
              subsystems; and passive optical network components including  splitters and
              combiners.  ***
