Abstract    :
              9414397  Levin    This three-year award supports U.S.-United Kingdom cooperative
              research in  biological oceanography on the role of oxygen as a forcing
              function for benthic  processes in the Arabian Sea.  The U.S. investigators are
              Lisa Levin, University of  California at San Diego, Craig Smith, University of
              Hawaii, and the U.K.  investigators are John Gage, Scottish Association for
              Marine Sciences, Tony Rice  and others at the Institute of Oceanographic
              Sciences, and Paul Tyler of the  University of South Hampton.    The research
              will commence with field studies aboard the British ship RRS  Discovery to be
              followed by analytic work in the U.S. and the United Kingdom.   The U.S.
              investigators will examine changes in the macrofaunal community structure  and
              associated shifts in bioturbation that occur in response to bottom-water oxygen
               gradients.  Bioturbation will be evaluated using a naturally-occurring,
              particle-  associated radiotracer, pigment tracers, seafloor photography and
              x-radiography.   The British investigators will examine hydrography, benthic
              community metabolism  and community structure of all faunal size categories. 
              Resulting data will be used to  test and improve existing models of benthic
              processes.     The project takes advantage of British expertise and experience
              in different oceans.   It also affords the U.S. investigators with an
              unparalleled opportunity to extend their  previous studies of oxygen minimum
              zones and bioturbation to the Arabian Sea.  This study on benthic processes and
              oxygen depletion in seafloors will advance  knowledge and understanding of the
              effects of global warming on marine  ecosystems.  ***
