Abstract    :
              9414291  Tandy  Theoretical investigations and calculations in hadron physics
              are  being carried out within a QCD-based model field theory for the 
              non-perturbative regime appropriate to current and future nuclear  physics
              issues.  The specific topics being addressed include a  confining quark
              condensate model of the nucleon, off-shell  structure of the propagator for
              selected composite quark-  antiquark mesons, dressed quark and meson
              substructure effects in  electromagnetic and axial currents of hadrons, and
              meson mixing  related to charge symmetry breaking in the nuclear force.  The 
              work is aimed at providing a bridge between quark-gluon dynamics  and effective
              meson-nucleon dynamics that will be necessary as  experimental programs, such
              those at CEBAF, probe nuclear  interactions at a distance scale within the size
              hadrons.  ***
