Abstract    :
              Seidel    This three-year award supports U.S.-Spain cooperative research in 
              advanced methods for 3D numerical relativity between the  relativity group at
              the National Center for Supercomputing  Applications at the University of
              Illinois and the relativity  group at the University of the Balearic Islands in
              Spain.  These  groups will develop numerical codes to explore aspects of
              general  relativity using a new mathematical formulation of the Einstein 
              equations.  This formulation permits application to the Einstein  equations
              sophisticated numerical techniques, based on the  harmonic time slicing
              condition, that will allow for a more  accurate numerical solution to these
              equations than has been  possible.      The NCSA group will benefit by drawing
              from the UIB group's  expertise on this advanced formulation of the Einstein
              equations  and appropriate numerical methods.  The UIB group's access to  NCSA
              resources and expertise will permit the UIB group to develop  and test
              numerical algorithms and attack physical problems, such  as the 3D numerical
              study of pure gravitational waves and black  holes.  Together these groups will
              be able to build a 3D  numerical code capable of solving physical problems with
               unprecedented accuracy.
