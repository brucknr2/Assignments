Abstract    :
              9414028  Beard  The data-handling equipment supplied here will form the "Event 
              Reconstruction Facility" at Hampton University.  This facility  will allow the
              reconstruction and analysis of data taken in the  course of the study of
              nuclear structure and properties at the  CEBAF laboratory.  This will allow a
              more active research program  at Hampton, and expand its present research
              significantly.  ***
