Abstract    :
               NSF funding of $580,000 will be equally matched by monies from Texas Tech
              University for the renovation of research facilities for the interdisciplinary
              Plasma and Pulsed Power Research Program.  The building is important to
              affected researchers, because it provides separate and unique facilities for
              experiments in physics and electrical engineering. Isolation of the space from
              classroom and administrative uses is important for experiments which involve
              high levels of noise and electrical interference and which sometimes continue
              for 24 hours/day over several days.  The 60-year old building will be
              completely renovated for removal of all contaminating asbestos, repair of
              leaking windows and roof, installation of new flooring, a partial second floor,
              a new HVAC system, an overhead crane and a large access (loading) door.  The
              renovated building will provide a dedicated facility for conduct of research
              that is seldom undertaken at universities, because of the interference with
              other normal university functions.  The program receives approximately $2M per
              year and is the largest research program on campus.   Support comes from a
              variety of federal agencies as well as industry.  The research is directed
              primarily at high power activities, including industrial and military
              applications and NASA lunar and planetary missions.  The facility will be used
              for the interdisiplinary work required for studies in power generation,
              conditioning, and applications for space and terrestrial missions in the next
              10-30 years and will benefit 12 faculty members, 3 post docs, and 30 graduate
              and 10 undergraduate students.    ***
