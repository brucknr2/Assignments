Abstract    :
              9414336  Kamoua  High performance fundamental mode InP based Gunn sources
              operating at D-Band frequencies shall be developed.  The goal is to achieve CW
              output powers greater than 100mW at efficiencies approaching 5% at 140GHz. 
              Design of these sources shall be accomplished using a Monte Carlo model.  A PhD
              graduate student supported by this grant will conduct the actual fabrication
              and testing at the EPSD of the Army Research Labs.  ***
