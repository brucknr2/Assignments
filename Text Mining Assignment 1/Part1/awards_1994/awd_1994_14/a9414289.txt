Abstract    :
              9414289  Schlenoff  Kinetics and isotherms of the adsorption of polyelectrolytes
              to  solid/liquid and liquid/liquid interfaces will be investigated.   Metal
              surfaces derivatized with surface-attached redox groups  will be employed to
              control the surface charge precisely in an  effort to relate polymer
              conformation and coverage to surface  charge density.  These "smart"
              redox-active surfaces will be used  to ascertain whether adsorption falls under
              thermodynamic or  kinetic control.  Radiolabelled hydrophilic/hydrophobic 
              copolymers, such as styrene sulfonate/butyl styrene, will be  synthesized and
              their adsorption at the interface between two  immiscible liquids will be
              studied.  For adsorbed  polyelectrolytes, the dependence of average coil radius
              on salt  concentration will be measured and compared with the well-known 
              dependence of solution polyelectrolyte dimensions on screening  length. 
              Diblock copolymers yielding brush-type morphologies will  be adsorbed at the
              solid/liquid and liquid/liquid interfaces and  their surface coverages at these
              two interfaces will be compared  and related to the mobility of the hydrophobic
              surface-anchoring  block.  Absorption of a polyelectrolyte into an oppositely- 
              charged gel will be measured to determine the extent and kinetics  of
              penetration of a charged macromolecule into a charged matrix  under conditions
              of zero applied electric field.    %%%  Adsorption of polyelectrolytes is the
              critical step in the  treatment of water for environmental purposes (drinking
              water,  municipal and industrial effluents, etc.).  This research will  provide
              important experiments that can be correlated with various  adsorption theories.
