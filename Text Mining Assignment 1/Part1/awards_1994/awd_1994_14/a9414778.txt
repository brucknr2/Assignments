Abstract    :
              9414778  Trumper       The award is for research to analyze, construct, and test
              a  precision magnetically-suspended six degree-of-freedom motion  control stage
              with 25 angstrom resolution.  The workspace is 25 mm  by 25 mm by 100
              micrometers.  The stage will have a repeatability  of 5 nanometers, and an
              accuracy of 20 nanometers.  The stage uses  a hybrid magnetic/fluid bearing
              structure, the oil providing  mechanical damping and the electromagnetic
              actuators imposing  control forces.  Integrated circuit capacitance
              displacement probes  will be developed as will a multipass laser interferometer
              with  enhanced resolution.  Mechanical designs and electromagnetic  actuator
              topologies to achieve the desired travel and actuator  goals will also de
              developed.  System integration and control  issues will also be addressed.     
               The stage will enable imaging of groups of atoms in  conjunction with probed
              microscopes.  In addition, it would be  useful for measurements associated with
              present and future  generations of integrated circuits, photo-masks, and
              micromechaical  actuators.
