Abstract    :
              9114783  Saka  A Study of the nature of boundary lubricant films will be 
              undertaken by a combination of laser Raman microprobe  spectroscopy of wearing
              surfaces, friction and wear  experiments, and molecular dynamic simulations of
              the  lubricant-solid interface.  The Raman spectra will be used  to determine
              coverage, orientation, and structural stability  of the molecules over a wide
              range of normal pressures and  temperatures and the results will be used as
              input to the  molecular dynamics model.  The configuration of the  lubricant
              macromolecules that lead to a stable boundary  lubricant film will be
              determined and visualized.  ***
