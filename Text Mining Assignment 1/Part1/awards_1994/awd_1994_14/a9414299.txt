Abstract    :
                     This experiment is designed to provide direct observational  constraints
              on the distribution of melt and the pattern of  upwelling beneath a mid-ocean
              ridge.  Studies of electromagnetic  and seismic wave propaation in the mentle
              with arrays of ocean-  bottom instruments will furnish measurements that can be
              inverted  to find horizontal and vertical variations in velocity and 
              conductivity structure that can be used to test theoretical models  of flow.   
                 An array of 47 ocean-bottom seismometers will be deployed for  six months on
              the East Pacific Rise at about 17 degrees south to  record teleseismic and
              regional earthquake sources.  P and S waves,  as well as other bady wave phases
              and Love and Rayleigh surface  waves recorded by the array will be used to
              probe lateral  variations in mantle structure to a depth of 100 to 200 km and
              out  to several hundred km from the ridge axis.  The mail goal is to  establish
              whether there is a narrow region of high melt  concentration and low seismic
              velocities directly beneath the ridge  axis and to map its vertical and
              horizontal extent.  Another goal  is to constrain the pattern of upwelling.
