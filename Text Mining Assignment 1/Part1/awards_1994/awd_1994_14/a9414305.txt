Abstract    :
              9414305  Beske-Diehl      The PIs will perform an exploratory investigation into
              the viability of using ESR spectroscopy signatures of volcanic ash and ejecta
              to determine synchroneity of distributed ash deposits.  In this investigation
              they will first determine whether magnetic properties are uniform throughout
              distal portions of at least two volcanic tephra units.  Next they will
              determine whether magnetic properties can identify tephra deposits from
              different eruptions of the sam volcano and from eruptions of different
              volcanoes by investigating magnetic properties of such tephra units.  ****
