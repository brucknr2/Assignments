Abstract    :
               The Chemistry Department at Mississippi State University will utilize NSF
              support for the renovation of more than 18,000 square feet in the first phase
              of a three stage process to improve research and research training
              laboratories.  This first component of an overall $11 million dollar building
              renovation project will benefit 115 researchers including undergraduate
              researchers participating in an NSF-REU site award.  The NSF-supported
              laboratory activity will increase bench and hood space through space
              reconfiguration; enhance safety; and expand laboratory opportunities for the
              disabled.  Subsequent MSU renovation work will address instructional facilities
              and the balance of research space within the Hand Laboratory building.  The
              structure is 30 years old and has never been renovated; through partnership
              with NSF, 14 research laboratories will be impacted, and the building's HVAC
              system will be replaced.  This initial activity will take two years and will
              enable Mississippi State to operate a nationally-competitive MS/Ph.D. research
              program with specific emphasis on chemical studies leading to the development
              of advanced composite materials and to the reduction of contaminants in soils. 
              It will also be important to the department's commitment to increase minority
              participation in research activities within the Chemistry department.
