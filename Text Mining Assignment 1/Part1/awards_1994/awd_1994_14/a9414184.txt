Abstract    :
                              9414184  WILSON  This  project  centers on the differences in 
              the  perception  of  environmental   risk   factors  among   Native   and  
              non-Native  populations  in  Alaska. Among the factors  which  contribute  to 
              different  perceptions are culture, language, economic  structure  as  well  as
               measures  of environmental  risk  factors.  Through  various  observational 
              techniques--surveys,  archived  data  and  ethnography--a  triangulation  of
              methodologies  is  intended  to  provide  a  rich contextual analysis. The
              present  proposal  will  support  a  working conference of experts to explore 
              substantive  and methodological issues raised by parallel projects in Oklahoma 
              and  Alaska,  both  of which examine risk perceptions  by  Native  Americans. 
              There presently exists no clearly defined methodology  for  asssessing
              cross-cultural risk perception. This project will  thus  break  new ground of
              great significance for  the  field  of  decision science and contribute to the
              development of the  policy  sciences in the U.S. Arctic, nationally and
              internationally.  ***
