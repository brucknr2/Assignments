Abstract    :
              9414979  Rankin        The American Mathematical Society requests a grant in the
              amount of  $122,573 to support a mathematical research institute during the
              summer of  1995.  The proposed institute will be the forty-second in a series
              planned  with the purpose of bringing together a group of mathematicians
              interested in  a particular field of mathematical research.  Emphasis is placed
              on  instruction at every high level with seminars and lectures by distinguished
               mathematicians in related fields, to promote interaction between participants 
              while broadening their mathematical perspectives. "Algebraic Geometry" has 
              been selected as the topic of the 1995 Summer Research Institute by the 1993 
              AMS Committee on Summer Institutes and Special Symposia.        Members of the
              Organizing Committee for the proposed 1995 Summer  Research Institute on
              "Algebraic Geometry" are:  Henri Gillet, Janos Kollar,  Robert Lazarfeld,
              Robert Mcpherson, David Morrison and Y.-T. Siu. The 1995  Institute will be
              held at a location in the western United States.  The  Society will be
              responsible for making suitable arrangements for lecture and  seminar rooms and
              for the handling of local administrative matters.  The  institute is expected
              to be held during a three-week period in July/August,  1995.
