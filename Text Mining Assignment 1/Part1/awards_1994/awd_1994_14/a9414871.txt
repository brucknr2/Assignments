Abstract    :
                9414871  Robertson  Research laboratories within the South Wing of the seventy
              -year old Life Sciences  building at the University of Idaho will be renovated
              with the support of NSF funds.   The renovation will develop four modern
              labmratories to meet the modern needs of  scientists in the Departments of
              Microbiology, Molecular Biology and Biochemistry  (MMBB) and Biological
              Sciences.  The project will address major existing problems  with temperature
              control, dust and mold contamination, ventilation system noise,  antiquated
              laboratory furnishings, major deficiencies in electrical and plumbing 
              services, negative air pressure, and inefficient design of laboratory space. 
              The  laboratories, constructed in 1924, have not been renovated for 26 years
              and several  contain the original laboratory furnishings.      Molecular
              techniques will be emphasized in the laboratory for plant systematics and  also
              for vertebrate biology -- both within the department of biological sciences.  A
               third laboratory in Biological Sciences is dedicated to cell physiology.  The
              structural  characterization of proteins will be studied in the renovated
              Microbiology, Molecular  Biology and Biochemistry space.The University of Idaho
              programs have grown  considerably over the last decade.  MMBB has twelve
              faculty; ten of whom faculty  have been hired since 1986.   Productivity in the
              department has increased  significantly and led to development of a new
              undergraduate major in Molecular   Biology and Biochemistry.  Fifty graduate
              students are enrolled in departmental  programs and nineteen undergraduates
              worked on research projects during the 1994  academic year.  A similar impact
              will be felt in Biological Sciences which has  nineteen faculty, 27 graduate
              students and five postdoctorals.  Twenty undergraduates  were involved in
              research studies during 1994.  The programs emphasize recruitment  and
              retention of students representing both genders, all ethnic groups, and the 
              physically challenged.
