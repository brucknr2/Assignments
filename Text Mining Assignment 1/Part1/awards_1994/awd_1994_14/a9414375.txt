Abstract    :
              9414375  Sitar  This action is to support the collection of geotechnical 
              engineering data on the Northridge earthquake of January 17, 1994  , so as to
              better understand the cause and effects of earthquake  strong ground shaking. 
              The overall objective in gathering this  perishable data is to apply the
              knowledge gained to help mitigate  the effects of future earthquakes.    For
              this project, particular focus is directed towards gathering  data for
              assessing the following: (1) the liquefaction (that is,  ground failure) and
              ground compaction, and the associated ground  displacements, (2) the effect of
              local soil conditions on ground  shaking characteristics and damage patterns,
              (3) the seismic  response of natural slopes, and (4) the seismic response of
              earth  structures such as dams, embankments, solid waste landfills, 
              mechanically stabilized retaining structures, and structural  fills.  ***
