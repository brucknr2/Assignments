Abstract    :
              9414793  Sachs       Recognizing that both physical and electronic models are  
              crucial to the design process, the researched work will create a   system
              wherein the designer can manipulate either type of model and   can readily
              translate between the two.  The impact of the project   is that it will provide
              a systematic and fluid approach to the   design of three dimensional shapes
              which can be employed for a wide  range of applications.  By providing a
              complete cycle which can be  entered at any point, the system embraces the
              iterative nature of  design and gains versatility.       The translation from
              electronic to physical models is done   using a rapid prototyping technique,
              such as three dimensional  printing.  The designer can then use hand tools to
              sculpt the model  by carving, shaping and adding material to the model.  Once 
              satisfied with the changes, the translation from physical to  electronic domain
              is done by digitizing the physical model.  The  designer then uses a set of
              electronic tools to translate the  digitized information into changes in the
              electronic model.   Conventional as well as novel CAD tools can then be used to
               manipulate the electronic model.  The cycle can then be repeated as 
              necessary.
