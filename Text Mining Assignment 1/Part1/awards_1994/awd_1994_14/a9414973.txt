Abstract    :
                The Department of Chemistry at the College of the Holy Cross has a long
              tradition of excellence in instruction, curriculum innovation, research
              training and research.  In 1990, the College ranked 13th out of 925 private,
              undergraduate institutions, in the number of graduates earning doctorates in
              chemistry from 1979 to 1988. At Holy Cross, research training begins at the
              student's first year through a research-oriented curriculum called Discovery
              Chemistry.  Students learn through active participation with other students and
              faculty.  This joint effort fosters cooperation instead of competition, and
              illustrates to students the dependence each scientist has on the entire
              scientific community.   In addition to the department's commitment to research
              training, eight of nine faculty members maintain active  chemical research
              programs in organometallics, analytical chemistry, photochemistry and medicinal
              chemistry.  Research is conducted in Haberlin Hall, a 1959 structure that is
              home to the department.  The present configuration and antiquated condition of
              the building impedes research by isolating laboratories from departmental
              activities that limits contact opportunities students or other faculty have
              with the research facilities on a regular basis. To improve this situation, the
              College, with assistance from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program,
              will  consolidate and renovate research space to establish a research complex. 
              The HVAC system, interior surfaces, fume hoods, benches and storage areas will
              also be upgraded.  These renovations will foster collegial interactions,
              promote collaborative investigations and better support the modern research
              methods of the Department.  The project is in harmony with the Department's
              overall emphasis on cooperative learning, and it will continue to enhance the
              strong record of research and research training at Holy Cross.
