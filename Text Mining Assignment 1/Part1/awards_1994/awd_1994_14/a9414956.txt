Abstract    :
              9414956  Taylor  The Board on Physics and Astronomy, in collaboration with the 
              National Materials Advisory Board, has established a committee to  carry out a
              major study of the field of optical science and  engineering (OS&E), a diverse
              interdisciplinary area of  scientific and technological activity that is
              playing an  increasingly area of scientific and technological activity that  is
              playing an increasingly important role in driving economic  growth.  OS&E is
              emerging as a key enabling element for a host of  applications that address
              critical national needs such as  manufacturing, information technology, health
              care,  transportation, environment, and education.  It is also a vital  area of
              frontier scientific research.  The purpose of the study is to define the field
              of optical  science and engineering, assess the state of the art in research 
              and technology, project the future impact of OS&E on national  needs, identify
              institutional and educational innovations needed  to optimize the contributions
              of OS&E to national needs, identify  how public policy influences the ability
              of the field to meet  these needs, and examine trends in private and public
              research  activities as compared to those in other countries.  The study is
              being supported jointly by NSF, NIST, and ARPA.  The  Foundation of the report
              will be based on the conduct of 5 major  workshops; each workshop would be
              organized according  to  national needs and would address issues that cross
              OS&E  scientific and technical disciplinary boundaries.        ***
