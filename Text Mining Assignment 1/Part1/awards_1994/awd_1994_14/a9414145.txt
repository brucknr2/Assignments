Abstract    :
                The objective of this project is to develop software methods  that will allow
              accurate measurement of the intensities of  diffraction maxima (Bragg Peaks) in
              x-ray diffraction data  from macromolecular crystals.  In these data, the Bragg
               Peaks are often overlapping and are further obscured by  background signals. 
              Software currently used for data  analysis cannot accurately integrate across
              severely  overlapped peaks, and background calculations are not  accurate. 
              This problem can be addressed by using larger  detectors, but that solution is
              prohibitively expensive.  A  more economical solution depends on developing
              more accurate  methods for deconvolution and background determination. 
              Emphasis will be put on making the methods more accurate and  fast, with
              minimum user input required.  The routines  developed will  be compatible with
              crystallographic data-  processing software currently being used by
              macromolecular  crystallographers, and will be made available to the 
              crystallographic community.
