Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical chemistry program of the Chemistry   Division,
              Prof. Richard Bersohn of Columbia University will conduct   research in the
              area of controlled chemical reactions.  The yields of   chemical reactions are
              to be changed by variation of the relative phase   of two lasers, following the
              suggestion of Brumer, Shapiro and Hepburn.    Specifically, systems of the form
              HABC: HONO, HNCO, HNNN, HOOH and HOCD3,   dissociating into competing channels
              HA + BC  or H + ABC will be   investigated.    While control of the relative
              phase has been used to successfully   demonstrate one photon and three photon
              absorption processes, phase   control of molecular dissociation has not been
              demonstrated so far.    These experiments will contribute to our understanding
              and ultimately to   our ability of controlling the outcome of chemical reaction
              along a   desired path.
