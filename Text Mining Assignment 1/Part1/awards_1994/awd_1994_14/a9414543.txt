Abstract    :
              9414543  Borden  Compaction grouting is an important tool both for pre- 
              construction ground improvement and post-construction  remediation of projects
              in geomaterials, including  tunneling, trenching, underpinning and lifeline
              engineering  under natural hazard conditions.  Although the general 
              methodology is widely used, the methodology is empirical and  basic mechanics
              and processes are not well understood.  This  research has the following
              objectives:  1) to develop a  model to predict in situ injection geometric
              relationships;  2) to develop an appropriate test which can be used for the 
              design of a compaction grouting operation;  3) to verify the  model and test(s)
              in laboratory and full-scale field  injection experiments.  The result of this
              research will be  a verified model and test procedures which will permit 
              optimized and reliable design of soil and site improvement  by compaction
              grouting.
