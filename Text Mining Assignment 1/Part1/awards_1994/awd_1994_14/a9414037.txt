Abstract    :
              9414037  Zita    The rapidly oscillating peculiar A stars, known as roAp stars, 
              exhibit small amplitude brightness variations with periods of  minutes or tens
              of minutes.  While this behavior is similar to the  p-mode oscillations
              observed in the sun, a different excitation  mechanism must be involved.  The
              PI suggests that magnetic  fluctuations are a strong possibility.  She has
              shown that the  conditions in the envelopes of the roAp stars are suitable for
              this  mechanism.  With the support of this Research Planning Grant she  will
              establish the initial and boundary conditions needed to model  the dynamics of
              the roAp star envelopes and produce some test  models.  ***
