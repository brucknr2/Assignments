Abstract    :
              This award will support collaborative research between  Montana State University
              (Dr. L.A. Lindblom) and the  Institute for advanced Studies in Basic Sciences,
              Zanjan,  Iran (Dr. Masood-ul-Alam).  The investigators intend to  study a
              number of mathematical questions related to various  astrophysical problems in
              which strong gravitational fields  play an important role.  In particular they
              propose to  investigate the symmetry and uniqueness properties of  equilibrium
              stellar models in general relativity theory, the  relationships between the
              microscopic equation of state of  matter in relativistic stellar models and the
              macroscopic  observable properties of these stars, and some interesting 
              mathematical questions that have arisen in the study of the  oscillations and
              stability of rapidly rotating stellar  models.     The proposed research
              projects are part of the fabric of  current scientific interest in stellar
              stars, and their  successful completion will advance the state of our 
              knowledge of gravitational physics.  ***
