Abstract    :
                    9414891  Arruda  This project is to conduct a nonisothermal analytical and
               experimental study of viscoelastic fiber drawing.  Two types of  viscoelastic
              fibers will be considered, glass and a liquid  crystalline polymer.  The
              project will include the manufacture of  these two fiber types to perform an
              extensive characterization  program that will lead to the development of the
              evolution  equation.  Characterization of the fibers will include mechanical, 
              thermal and optical analyses both before and after processing and  chemical
              treatments.  ***
