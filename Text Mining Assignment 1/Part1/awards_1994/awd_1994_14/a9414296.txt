Abstract    :
              This conference support grant will utilize funds to support  subsistence and/or
              travel for invited speakers, discussion leaders,  graduate students, and others
              who require financial assistance in  order to attend.  The biennial Gordon
              Conference in Space Plasma  Physics addresses current topics in space physics
              research.  This  particular conference's theme is collisionless dissipation,
              which  is common to much of the space physics environment and supports  many
              current and future programs.
