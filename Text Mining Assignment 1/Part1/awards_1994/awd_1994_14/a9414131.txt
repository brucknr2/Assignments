Abstract    :
              9414131  Ajjarapu  The objective of this project is to develop a unified frame
              work,  which can be used to study voltage stability in the structure 
              preserving power system model.  This project will develop a  systematic
              sensitivity analysis that identifies the areas,  components and the parameters
              which are responsible for possible  voltage collapse.      The salient features
              of this project are:              o Includes all the key dynamic devices are
              recommended by             the recent CIGRE task force,              o
              Continuation power flow with small signal dynamic              formulation
              systematically traces the entire PV curve         with dynamic stability
              information,         o Realistic load increase and generation sharing scheme
              with         relevant limits (in particular, it replaces the constant          
               generator field and armature current limits),         o Derivation of
              parametric sensitivity of algebraic                  variables in terms of
              parametric sensitivity of state         variables.  This basically gives the
              contributions of any          parameter to a particular critical point,        
               o Derivation of dynamic index that indirectly identifies              the
              approaching critical point,           o Classification of angle or voltage
              related problems,         o Application of recent results of
              differential-geometric             methods to reduce DAE's into ODE's to obtain
              efficient              time domain simulations,         o Practical
              significance of Node-Focus and 1:1 resonance.  ***
