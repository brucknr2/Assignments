Abstract    :
                      9414027  Tomozawa  This Academic Research Infrastructure Program Award
              is made to  provide partial support for a Nano Test 550 Indenter System.  This 
              instrument will be used to investigate the mechanical properties of  surface
              and interfaces of glasses, metals and composite materials.   The equipment will
              be used to study the mechanical fatigue of glass  fibers and in a program of
              glass properties related to  microelectronic devices.  ***
