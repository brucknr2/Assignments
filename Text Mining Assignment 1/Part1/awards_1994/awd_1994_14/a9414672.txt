Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    Proposal Number:  CTS-9414672  P.I.:  P.K. Lim     The principle
              investigator is presenting the research findings of an NSF-sponsored project at
              the "Mr. Clean" Conference that is to be held at Spartanburg, SC on April
              27-29.  The goal is to effect the commercial adoption of a new synthesis
              technique that is environmentally benign.  The new synthesis technique is based
              on research, entitled "Oil-Water Interfacial Synthesis as a Benign and Safer
              Alternative to Conventional Liquid-Phase Syntheses," that has been funded by
              the NSF.     The interfacial reaction technique avoids the need for toxic or
              hazardous solvents by using an innocuous oil-water mixture in conjunction with
              a surface-active catalyst complex.  A surface-active ligand is used to draw the
              catalyst to the oil-water interface, where the catalyst effects the reaction
              and where it can also be recovered.  The new technique differs from
              conventional phase-transfer reaction technique in that the reaction occurs at
              the interface, rather than in one of the bulk phases.  Aside from being
              environmentally benign, the interfacial synthesis technique also offers the
              advantages of easy catalyst recovery, high reactivity and selectivity that is
              normally associated with homogenous catalysis, and ease of operation.     The
              new technique has been successfully demonstrated on the coupling polymerization
              of 2, 6-dimethylphenol.  high molecular-weight poly (phenylene oxide) has been
              obtained in a high yield (>85%) under mild reaction conditions.  Detailed
              kinetic results will be presented at the conference.
