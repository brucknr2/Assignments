Abstract    :
              A Siemens P4 X-ray diffractometer equipped with low-temperature  capabilities
              will be acquired for the research and teaching  program at Delaware State
              University using funds from the  Academic Research Infrastructure Program. The
              research areas to  be studyied are: 1) inorganic and organometallic compounds, 
              mineral physics, and materials science. Specifically, topics to  be studied
              include: structure-reactivity relationships in  organic molecular crystals, 
              antiviral applications of  oxometallic complexes, and the high pressure phases
              of mantle  minerals using hot-pressing techniques.    A X-ray diffractometer
              will low temperature capabilities will  be utilized in the study of
              structure-reactivity relationships  in organic molecular crystals, antiviral
              applications of  oxometallic complexes, and the high pressure phases of mantle 
              minerals.
