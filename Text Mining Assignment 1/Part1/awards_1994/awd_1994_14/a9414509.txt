Abstract    :
              9414509  Incera  Since 1911, it has been known that certain materials, like, for
               instance, mercury, lose all their resistance at some low critical 
              temperature.  The state with zero resistance persists at  temperatures below
              the critical one.  This property is called  superconductivity.  Until 1986, the
              highest critical temperature  ever observed was of the order of -418 F.  In
              that year a new  class of superconducting materials were discovered.  For them
              the  superconducting state appears at critical temperatures around -  244 F. 
              This discovery has great technological implications.  If  scientists obtain a
              enough high superconducting temperature, the  superconductors could be used for
              many energy saving  applications.  However, the theoretical model known as the
              Bardeen Cooper  Schrieffer (BCS) theory, which in 1957 explained the phenomenon
               of supersonductivity at low temperatures, is unable to give a  satisfactory
              explanation for the behavior of the modern high-  temperature superconductors. 
              Without a thorough understanding of  the physical mechanism that produces this
              impressive phenomenon,  its practical implementation will be very limited.  It
              has been shown that a zero temperature a system formed by  particles with
              fractional statistics, known as anyons, is  superconductor.  This property has
              encouraged the idea that the  anyons could serve to modeling the
              high-Temperature  superconductivity.  However, it is still unclear if an anyon 
              system superconducts at finite temperature.  This proposal  intends to address
              this problem by investigating the effects of  topological defects in models of
              anyons at finite temperature and  density.  ***
