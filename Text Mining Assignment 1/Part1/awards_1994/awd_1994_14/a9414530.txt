Abstract    :
              9414530  Kovacevic   The award is for developing a sensing technique to measure
              the three-dimensional  shape of weld pools in gas tungsten arc welding.  Image
              processing and vision algorithms will also be developed to process the acquired
              image and compute the shape of the weld pool surface based on iterative
              techniques, regression methods, and neural networks.  Structured light from a
              short-duration pulsed laser and transmitted through a grid is used to
              illuminate the weld pool.  The reflected light contains information about the
              pool shape.  Extraction of this information is the function of the image
              processing algorithms.  The feasibility of the method has been demonstrated,
              development of techniques for real-time image extraction and pool surface
              computation being the objective of the current effort.   Welding processes are
              widely used.  On-line measurement of three-dimensional weld pool shape and its
              subsequent correlation with weld quality would ensure more consistent welds in
              a wide variety of applications.
