Abstract    :
                This one year award will support U.S.-U.K. cooperative research in fluid
              mechanics between Harindra Fernando of Arizona State University and Julian C.
              R. Hunt of the University of Cambridge. The objective of their research is an
              investigation of turbulence within and near density interfaces.   The
              theoretical and numerical work conducted by researchers at the University of
              Cambridge and the British Meteorological Office will be  complemented by
              laboratory experiments at Arizona State University.  Turbulent flow
              configurations are replete in nature, and turbulent mixing plays a dominant
              role in heat and mass balances in oceans and the atmosphere.  The proposed
              research will study turbulence when it is subjected to (1) differential
              turbulent forcing from contiguous turbulent layers of unequal intensities and
              (2) velocity shear.  The results of the research will advance understanding of
              turbulent mixing across environmental density interfaces and enhance
              capabilities for parameterization of sub-grid scale processes in oceanic and
              atmospheric General Circulation Models.
