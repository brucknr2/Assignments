Abstract    :
              9414129  Strier    Knowing the reproductive state of particular female primates 
              (whether pregnant, near the time of ovulation, and so on) is  an important, but
              thusfar very difficult, thing to know in  understanding and predicting
              behavioral patterns, both of  males and females.  There are indications that
              assays of  feces may provide an invaluable, non-invasive way for  evaluating
              steroid levels (and hence reproductive states).  However, the use of fecal
              steroid assays in this way remains  controversial, and a thorough validation of
              assay techniques  is required before these results can be interpreted and 
              applied with any confidence.    This one year exploratory grant will provide
              such a  validation test that a group of experts in the field have  been
              developing.  They will utilize a set of fecal samples  obtained previously
              fromwild females whose behavior has been  followed on a daily basis, and they
              will also be analyzing  daily urine and fecal samples collected from 2 
              reproductively active female monkeys to see how the two  sources of steroids
              "track" one another.
