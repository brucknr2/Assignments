Abstract    :
              9414416  Klobutcher  The molecular mechanisms involved in DNA rearrangement
              processes of eukaryotic organisms are, in many instances, poorly understood.
              This laboratory has been studying the extensive genome reorganization that
              occurs in hypotrichous ciliated protozoan Euplotes crassus. During its life
              cycle, this organism transforms a copy of its chromosomal micronucleus into a
              macronucleus that contains only short linear, gene-sized DNA molecules. On the
              order of 100,000 interstitial segments of DNA are deleted during this process,
              including short elements(internal eliminated sequences; IESs) and highly
              repetitive, transposon-like elements. Differential screening approaches will be
              used to isolate genes and proteins that are expressed specifically during
              macronuclear development. The developmental cDNA library will also be expressed
              and screened using segments of DNA that undergo rearrangement as probes in an
              attempt to directly identify clones that encode proteins that interact with
              rearrangement sites. The isolated genes will be analyzed in regard to time of
              developmental expression and studies will be done to determine if their gene
              products localize to the developing macronucleus. Such genes, if found, will be
              completely sequenced to gain further insight into their function.   %%%  DNA
              rearrangement is used as a means of constructing functional protein coding
              regions and thus can be viewed as a means of developmentally regulating gene
              expression. To learn about such processes in a eukaryotic organism, this
              laboratory has been, and will continue, to study the extensive genome
              reorganization that occurs in the hypotrichous ciliated protozoan, Euplotes
              crassus. Studies in this area will include determining which of the multiple
              nuclei in a cell undergoing macronulear development is responsible for
              producing developmentally regulated transcripts and examining
              developmental-specific genes for shared sequence elements that are potentially
              involved in their coordinate regulation.  ***
