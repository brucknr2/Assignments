Abstract    :
                   Inorganic and organic peroxides are detected in the atmosphere  and in
              rain, snow and fog, and there is evidence that their  concentration has been
              increasing.  Peroxides interfere with normal  plant growth, and play an
              important role in the conversion of  sulfur dioxide to sulfuric acid in cloud
              water.  Photochemical air  pollution involves a complex set of chemical
              reactions initiated by  sunlight-generated free radicals.  These reactions both
              consume and  generate peroxides, and are the subject of active research aimed
              at  developing effective pollution control strategies.  Hydrogen  peroxide
              concentration increases with solar intensity, but diurnal  profiles of organic
              peroxides suggest an alternative source,  possibly involving ozone and biogenic
              hydrocarbons.  This research  will involve laboratory and field studies aimed
              at a better  understanding of peroxide occurrence and chemistry.  The project 
              scientists will develop the ability to detect trace concentrations  of
              individual peroxides using high performance liquid  chromatography with
              fluorescence detection, and study the rate at  which individual peroxides
              deposit to grasslands and forest  canopies.  Undergraduate chemistry majors at
              a small four-year  college will participate in all aspects of this Research in 
              Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) project.
