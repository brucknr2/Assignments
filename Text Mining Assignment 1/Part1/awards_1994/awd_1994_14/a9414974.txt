Abstract    :
               NSF and Emory University will co-fund a major renovation of 20-year old Atwood
              Hall for the benefit of Chemistry research and research training.  The project
              is part of a major effort on the Emory campus to consolidate the disciplines of
              Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, and Computer Science into one large complex. 
              Planning for the renovation has followed a carefully developed needs assessment
              and design process.   NSF support which represents less than 30% of the project
              expense will be used to support the installation of a new HVAC system
              permitting enhanced environmental control, replacement of ductwork to eliminate
              particulate matter, conversion of new and existing hoods to variable air volume
              design, modification of the fire protection systems for code compliance, and
              installation of a 10base-T system for networking for high speed computing.    
              The renovations will facilitate research activities in two broad areas: 
              traditional inorganic, organic, physical and analytical chemistry, and new
              areas including materials, biomolecular, and computational chemistry.  Thirteen
              faculty will be direct beneficiaries of the renovation, and the majority of the
              117 graduate students will receive research training and will conduct
              independent experiments within the renovated space.  Undergraduates are
              encouraged to participate in research activities, and the space enhancements
              will permit safer and expanded participation by this group.
