Abstract    :
              9414355  Nash       This research is focused on the development of algorithms
              for  nonlinear programming, particularly, problems that involve many 
              variables.  The emphasis is on algorithms suitable for parallel  computer
              implementation.  The aim is at methods suitable for  coarse-grained parallel
              computers where each processor is itself  moderately powerful.  The domain of
              target processors of interest  include computers such as the Intel Paragon and
              Cray  supercomputers.  The algorithms developed are aimed to be general- 
              purpose, easy to use, and ultimately implemented as a computer  software.      
              Nonlinear programming problems exist in several sectors of the  economy,
              including both the industrial and military systems.   However, nonlinear
              programming models can be difficult to solve.   The general-purpose nature of
              the algorithms to be developed will  make available the power of computers to
              users of nonlinear models,  and hence extend the range of nonlinear programming
              as an everyday  modeling tools.
