Abstract    :
              9414262  Arimoto     This project involves the study of mineral dust, a suite of
              trace elements, and two radionuclides (210Pb and 7Be) as part of the AEROCE
              Phase III Program.  The studies will focus on Theme 2 (Marine Aerosols and
              Climate).  Daily bulk aerosol samples will be collected from four sites
              (Bermuda, Barbados, Izana and Lanzarote), and they will be analyzed using
              instrumental neutron activation.  The analyses will generate data for mineral
              dust and several chemical tracers (Se, Sb, and Zn).  We also propose a
              continuation of studies of two radionuclides (210Pb and 7Be) at Barbados.  In
              addition, cascade impactor samples will be collected on an intensive basis to
              characterize the mass particle-size distributions of mineral dust and several
              tracer elements; these data will also be used to characterize chloride deficits
              in size separated particles,     The relationships among these materials and
              various other substances studied for AEROCE will be used to infer sources and
              to investigate the atmosphere transport pathways responsible for their
              transport.  Special efforts will be made to relate the chemical data to news
              data on physical properties of the atmosphere that will be collected for AEROCE
              Theme 2.
