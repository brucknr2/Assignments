Abstract    :
              This project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program,  
              focusses on the application of scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM)   and
              optical imaging to characterizing the heterogeneity of carbon fiber   surfaces
              and the SECM-controlled modification of these surfaces to   produce regions
              which have been functionalized.  These microfabricated   surfaces will then be
              used to make unusual redox enzyme-based sensors   which will be broadly
              evaluated.  Professor David Wipf and his students   at Mississippi State
              University, working in collaboration with Professor   Werner Kuhr and his
              students at the University of California at   Riverside, will pursue these
              goals during the tenure of this thirty-four   month continuing grant.   
              Chemical modification of the surface of electrodes can enable unique  
              applications of these devices as molecularly selective sensors of target  
              analytes.  Carbon electrodes, particularly carbon fiber microelectrodes,  
              offer a rich synthetic platform on which to build a wide variety of  
              molecularly specific electrochemical sensors.  This research is aimed at  
              understanding the heterogeneity of surfaces of carbon fibers to be used   in
              these applications and the development of protocols for the spatially  
              resolved attachment of redox enzymes to these surfaces.  This research   should
              lead to the development of new analytical probes of broad   biotechnological
              importance.
