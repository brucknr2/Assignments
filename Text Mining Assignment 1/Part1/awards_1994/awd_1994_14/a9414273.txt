Abstract    :
              9414273  Bailey       The objective of this award is to learn and demonstrate
              the   functionality needed for a concurrent engineering project   management
              system to support an existing design process.  A second   objective is to learn
              how to build realistic, pre-definable, and   reasonably complete product
              development protocol models and to   build a library of objects representing
              activities, tasks, etc.,   from which many such models can be generated.  The
              final objective   is to learn and demonstrate how to build product development 
               protocol models from a library of design process objects and then   translate
              the models into data files for concurrent engineering   project management.    
                Design integration and management through processes such as   concurrent
              engineering is aimed at improving the engineering design   process, leading to
              products that are better design, easier to   manufacture, and more appropriate
              for use by consumers.
