Abstract    :
              9414984  DeFazio       This project is exploratory research into a
              design-specific  approach to Design For Assembly (DFA) in the Concurrent
              Engineering  environment.  The research addresses DFA for dense and complicated
               mechanical assemblies.  Objectives of the research are to explore  this realm
              in a systematic way, and to develop more rational bases  for collaboration of
              product design engineers concerned with  function, and production engineers
              concerned with assembly--in the  realm of concurrent engineering of dense,
              complicated, or tightly  specified and constrained mechanical assemblies.      
              The research uses the logic of Assembly Sequence Analysis  (ASA) as structure,
              tool, and a basis for measure of results.  ASA  is a design-specific logical
              means of relating product design  geometry to assembly choices.  Both design
              geometry and assembly  choices offer new metrics and support conventional ones:
               parts-  count, assembly-line topology, count of non-productive assembly 
              tasks, for example.  ASA has been used in one direction; from  product design
              to assembly choice.  Part of the work is to explore  possibilities of using ASA
              in the other direction; to flag awkward  assembly constraints, and to suggest
              areas for design  reconsideration.
