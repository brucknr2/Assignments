Abstract    :
                                        ABSTRACT                                  MCALISTER,
              Harold  AST-9414449    This grant provides partial support for the detailed
              design  and construction of a long-baseline, multiple-telescope 
              interferometric array operating at visible wavelengths.  The  CHARA Array will
              consist of five 1-m aperture telescopes in  a Y-shaped array contained within a
              400 m diameter circle.  This configuration will provide high resolution 
              interferometry in the visible spectral region with a  limiting resolution of
              0.2 milliarsec.  The facility will be  located on Mesa Negra, 130 km west of
              Albuquerque, New  Mexico.  The primary scientific programs will be directed at 
              the fundamental astrophysics of single and multiple stars  through
              interferometric analyses at visible wavelengths.  The Array will be applicable
              to problems in all areas of  contemporary astronomy, especially if it is later
              equipped  with adaptive optics and laser beacons.  The CHARA Array  will meet a
              critical goal of the Bachall Committee for  ground based interferometry for the
              1990's and provide a  unique and powerful new astronomical facility for the 
              nation.  * * *
