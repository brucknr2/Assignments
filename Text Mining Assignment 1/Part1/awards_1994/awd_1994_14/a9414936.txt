Abstract    :
              9414936       Many problems in science and engineering involve the 
              determination of the properties inside an object from  indirect measurements. 
              Examples include finding cracks of  defects inside solid metal objects and
              medical imaging.  Mathematically, these problems are often formulated as 
              inverse problems for partial differential equations.  In  such a problem, one
              determines an unknown coefficient in an  equation from (partial)knowledge of
              the solutions.  The  proposers will hold a week long conference devoted to the 
              mathematical theory of inverse problems for partial  differential equations. 
              The conference will take place at  the University of Kentucky.  The main
              activity of this  conference will be a series of ten lectures given by Gunther 
              Uhlmann of the University of Washington.  These lectures  will serve to
              introduce mathematicians to current research  in this field.
