Abstract    :
              9414361  Young  The objective of this research is testing the project 
              hypothesis that ground penetrating radar (GPR) reflections  are spatially
              correlated to hydraulic conductivities and  other soil properties.  Such a
              non-invasive geophysical  method is needed to supplement direct sampling, to
              obtain  nearly continuous subsurface coverage efficiently, and to  minimize
              operator exposure to potentially dangerous  materials.  GPR data will be
              acquired in test areas for  which extensive subsurface material
              characterizations have  already been accomplished.  Sites to be studied include
               saturated and unsaturated conditions, with local sites in  Michigan and also
              taking advantage of other field sites for  which a significant data base of
              hydraulic conductivity test  results exists (e.g. Mississippi, New Mexico, Cape
              Cod, and  Canada).  Statistical relationships for spatial  distributions will
              be sought between carefully obtained  hydraulic conductivity parameters and
              quantitative  descriptors of radar reflections.
