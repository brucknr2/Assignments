Abstract    :
                  9414614  Reddy  The project is an experimental and analytical investigation
              of  crack kinking in concrete structures bonded with prestressed and 
              nonprestressed fiber reinforced plastic (FRP) laminates.  Concrete  beams
              bonded with prestressed laminates exhibit superior strength  (3 to 4 times
              higher compared to those with nonprestressed ones).   The investigation will
              address the propagation of cracks into the  concrete core for specimens with
              varying thicknesses of the bonded  layer.
