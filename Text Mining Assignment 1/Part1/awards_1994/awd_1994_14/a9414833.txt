Abstract    :
              This ARI award will provide funding for the renovation of the environmental
              infrastructure and mechanical facilities supporting the research and research
              training spaces for the science building on the campus of Indiana State
              University.  The 36 year old facility houses four science departments; Life
              Sciences, Geography and Geology, Chemistry and Physics.  Currently, most of the
              laboratories are antiquated, unsafe and in desperate need of repair.  In spite
              of the science building's infrastructure deterioration, the university has
              established nationally recognized and funded research programs throughout the
              science departments.  The renovations for all research laboratories will
              consist of the following:  1) new walls, ceilings and floors; 2) installation
              of new fixed laboratory equipment; 3) new mechanical services, including supply
              and exhaust systems; 4) improved electrical services; and 5) new plumbing and
              fire protection systems.  Numerous state a federal and safety codes will be met
              once renovations are completed.  The renovation project will give research
              faculty the opportunity to expand competitive interdisciplinary research
              programs, offering quality research training to high school students, college
              undergraduates, master's and doctoral students.  The modernization of this
              facility will increase the quality of the research programs and allow for the
              initiation of new programs in the sciences.
