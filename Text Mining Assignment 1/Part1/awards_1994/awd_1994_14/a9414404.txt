Abstract    :
                 94114404 Altman  The mechanism of metal etching reactions will be  studied
              using high speed variable temperature STM along with  macroscopic surface
              analysis techniques.  The project will focus on  halogen etching of copper
              because of interest in using copper as an  interconnect material in integrated
              circuits.  The study will  concentrate on the two major reaction steps in
              halogen etching of  copper:  1)copper halide formation and  2)halide removal by
               sublimation and/or reaction.  The factors that limit etching rates  will be
              directly determined through STM "movies" monitoring the  surface under etching
              conditions.  A mechanistic kinetic model  based on the elementary reaction
              steps observed with STM will be  developed.  The results will guide development
              of new etching  processes and new etching schemes to directly pattern fine
              metal  lines. %%% This research is anticipated to provide an atomic-level 
              understanding of etching reactions that are an important step in  integrated
              circuit fabrication.  This understanding will aid  development of new etching
              processes to allow new materials to be  used in integrated circuits.  The use
              of new materials will be  required to continue the trend of increased device
              speed and  decreased device size into the next century.  The results of this 
              research will have an impact on the fabrication and general  perform ance of
              advanced devices and integrated circuits used in  computing, information
              processing, and tele communica tions.  ***
