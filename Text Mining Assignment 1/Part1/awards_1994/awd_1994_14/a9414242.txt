Abstract    :
              9414242  Angelici  Iowa State Univ.  Dr. Robert J. Angelici, Chemistry
              Department, Iowa State University, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic,
              and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division for research
              into thermochemical and reactivity studies of basic transition metal complexes.
              A major goal of this project is to quantitatively determine the factors which
              determine the basicity, or "electron richness", of metal centers in
              metal-hydride complexes. The calorimetrically determined enthalpies of
              protonation will be measured for a series of mononuclear complexes of chromium,
              tungsten, rhenium, iron, ruthenium, osmium, cobalt rhodium, and iridium in
              order to establish contributions of the metal and its ligands to the basicities
              of the complexes. These enthalpies will be combined with electrochemical
              oxidation potentials to give bond dissociation energies. The studies will be
              extended to polynuclear complexes.    Many transition metal hydride complexes
              are catalysts for a variety of industrial and laboratory processes. The
              activity of these catalysts is related to the ease with which the  hydrogen can
              move from metal to a reactant species. However, there is very little
              quantitative information available on the factors which determine the strength
              of the interaction between a  metal and a hydrogen atom. In this project the
              metal-hydrogen bond strengths will be determined for a range of metal
              complexes. These studies will provide a basis for understanding a broad range
              of reactivities of transition metal complexes and catalysts.
