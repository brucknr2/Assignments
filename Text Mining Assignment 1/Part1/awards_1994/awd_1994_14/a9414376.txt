Abstract    :
                    9414376  Havner  The objectives of this research are a comprehensive
              assessment of  hardening theories against experimental data through
              investigation  of their finite-strain texture predictions in f.c.c. crystalline
               aggregates and mathematical prediction and analysis of the basic  experimental
              phenomenon of progressive subgrain formation  (including microshear bands in
              subgrain walls) during plastic  deformation.  Achievement of these objectives
              would provide a  comparative assessment, previously unavailable, of hardening 
              theories in relation to texture formation in specific metals and an  analytical
              basis for continued subgrain formation and microshear-  band development with
              increasing deformation.  This study has the  potential to develop models and
              constitutive equations that will  enhance the understanding of large
              deformation processes in metals  and could lead to the development of new
              computational codes.  Such  codes might be useful for the prediction of the
              results of metal  forming and manufacturing processes.  ***
