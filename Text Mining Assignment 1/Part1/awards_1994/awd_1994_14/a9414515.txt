Abstract    :
              9414515  Berman       This international collaboration between Berman and FSU 
              scientist Kilin is to develop the theoretical tools to study the  single
              spectroscopy of impurity atoms in solids.  Recent  experimental advances
              coupled with the theoretical research  supported by this grant will lead to a
              greatly improved  understanding of the interaction of single molecules with
              optical  fields of arbitrary intensity in solid hosts.  ***
