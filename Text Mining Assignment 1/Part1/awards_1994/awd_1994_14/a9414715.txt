Abstract    :
              9414715  Bras       The focus of this research is to enhance environmentally
              safe   disposal/recycling by facilitating the inclusion of product take-   back
              considerations in product design.  Demanufacturing and   remanufacturing are
              the names of processes intended to enable both   material recycling and product
              reuse.  Demanufacturing   characterizes the entire process involved in
              recycling, reuse,   incineration, and/or disposal of a product after it has
              been taken   back by a company.  Remanufacturing deals with the refurbishment
              of   partly worn products for their subsequent reuse.       Due to the
              complexity of formulating systematic design   approaches that include
              environmental, economic, and technical   considerations, the objectives of the
              research are to establish an   engineering science base for:  (1) the
              operational parameters and   models of plastic-metal product de- and
              remanufacturing processes,   and (2) computer-based tools for the
              computer-aided design of these   products which can be recycled and reused
              through de- and   remanufacturing processes.
