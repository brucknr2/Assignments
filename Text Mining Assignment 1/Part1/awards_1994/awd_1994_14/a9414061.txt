Abstract    :
              9414061  Guilbeau  This proposal from Arizona State University requests partial 
              support for the 1994 Annual Fall Meeting of the Biomedical  Engineering Society
              (BMES) to be held on October 14-16, 1994  on the Arizona State University
              Campus in Tempe, Arizona.  Funding from the NSF will be used for travel support
              for  invited speakers to the special sessions on Cost Effective  Health Care
              Delivery Through Engineering and Rehabilitation  Engineering.    The symposium
              focuses on cardiopulmonary engineering,  cardiovascular science and
              engineering, cellular and tissue  engineering, medical imaging, neural
              engineering, orthopedic  engineering, and rehabilitation engineering.  The aim
              of the  conference is to bring together biomedical engineers to  promote the
              increase of biomedical engineering knowledge and  its utilization.    Presenter
              participants in the symposium are world leaders in  biomedical engineering. 
              Funding requested from the NSF  would provide partial support for invited
              participants in  Cost Effective Health Care Delivery Through Engineering and 
              the Rehabilitation Engineering sessions.  The results of the  conference will
              be recorded in a Proceedings, which will be  sent to all conference
              participants and to related  organizations and agencies, thereby making
              symposium results  available to a large audience.  ***
