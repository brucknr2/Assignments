Abstract    :
              This research encompasses two projects.  The first will analyze  the
              simultaneous increase in inequality and in the segregation of  high skill
              workers into separate firms.  It appears that workers  have been moving from
              firms like General Motors, which combine  workers of different skills, to firms
              like Microsoft or McDonalds  which hire workers of similar skills.  A model
              will be developed  to explore this phenomenon.  An implication of the model is
              that  either skill-based technological progress or increased skill  dispersion
              can cause high skill workers to segregate into  separate firms and reduce wages
              of low skill workers.    The second part of the project will develop and test a
              model of  the spread of AIDS based on matching of sexual partners under 
              various assumptions about the information concerning the risk of  infection. 
              In addition, an epidemiological analysis of how  behavior affects HIV
              prevalence will be integrated with an  economic analysis of how HIV prevalence
              affects incentives for  individuals behavior.
