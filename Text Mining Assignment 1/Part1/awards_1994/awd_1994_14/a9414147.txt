Abstract    :
              9414147  Elterich  Maritime regions of the world and facing  new opportunities
              to create a complex  regional infrastructure system which  embodies
              multi-function developments.   Such transformation requires a  comprehensive
              analysis of interactions  among all related elements: global  commerce and
              economy; environment; land  use; the resources; and political milieu as  well
              as engineering and technology.  This  project develops a large-scale model
              which  organizes the system's elements to facilitate  the analysis, predicts
              the consequences of a  decision, and identifies the actions to  achieve a given
              set of objectives.   Furthermore, the model incorporates new  methods and
              treatments of uncertainty  which exists in the causal relationships and  the
              effect of uncertainty on the strength of  the logical arguments in the plan 
              justification.    The project is divided into three phases:    Phase 1: 
              Identification of the elements  of the river basin system and their 
              relationships among themselves.    Phase 2:  Formulation of a set of  models
              for the land/sea inter-phase system.    Phase 3:  Testing of the model validity
               through real-world application: The Rio de  la Plata Region of Argentina as a
              case  study.
