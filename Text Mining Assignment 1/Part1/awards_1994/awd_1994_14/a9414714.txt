Abstract    :
              CTS-9414714  D. Frey  University of Maryland   Baltimore County      The
              purification of proteins using the analytical scale technique of
              chromaofocusing and its process scale analog of "buffer focusing" will be
              studied.  These techniques employ internally produced pH and ionic strength
              gradients to simultaneously concentrate and purify proteins without
              denaturation or precipitation.  The behavior of retained pH gradients obtained
              using multivalent buffering ions and the effect of the change in protein charge
              due to adsorption will be investigated.  Previous local equilibrium theories
              will be modified to include several buffering species will be used with strong
              and weak base ion-exchange adsorbents to generate retained and gradual pH
              gradients, respectively.  An improved understanding of buffer focusing as a
              novel method for bioseparations will be achieved.  It may lead to a less
              expensive and more efficient process for protein separations on a large scale.
