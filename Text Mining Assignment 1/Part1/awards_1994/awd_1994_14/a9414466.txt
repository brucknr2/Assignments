Abstract    :
              9414466  Federici  Growth and electrical/optical characterization of YBCO thin
              films for photoinduced superconductivity will be carried out.  In high
              transition temperature copper oxide superconductors, contrary to expectation,
              experimental evidence has indicated that interaction of a light pulse with the
              superconductor actually enhances the superconducting properties of the
              material.  The purpose of this research is to experimentally differentiate
              between competing models of the photoinduced superconductivity mechanism by
              correlating it with the sample's luminescent, optical + electrical properties,
              and to apply that knowledge in the design and demonstration of novel
              optically-controlled superconducting devices.  The project will support a PhD
              student who shall perform YBCO thin fabrication and Hall measurements at the
              Army's EPSD research facility in Fort Monmouth, NJ.  ***
