Abstract    :
              The 1994 IEEE/IMS Information Theory Workshop on "Information  Theory and
              Statistics" will present papers in the related fields  of (1) Stochastic
              complexity and universal data compression, (2)  randomization complexity and
              information theory, (3) Markov  random fields, (4) Vector quantization,
              classification, and  regression trees, (5) theory and applications of wavelets,
              and  (6) nonparametric function estimation. In addition to these  specific
              topics, there will be two open poster sessions  supporting research in all
              fields related to the theme of the  workshop.  The workshop will be held in the
              Old Town Holiday Inn,  Alexandria, Virginia over the dates of October 27
              through October  29, 1994.  The IEEE Information Theory Workshops play an 
              important role in exploring and supporting critical research  trends in the
              broad areas of communication system utilization and  digital data storage. 
              This area of research is commonly referred  to as the field of Information
              Theory and over the last forty  years has played a central role in the
              development of the  nation's communications infrastructure.  Recently, there
              has been  a significant rise in common research conducted by Information 
              Theorists and Statisticians.  It is the aim of the 1994 IEEE/IMS  Information
              Theory Workshop on "Information Theory and  Statistics" to enhance this work
              and improve the  cross-fertilization of ideas between the respective research 
              communities.  To support this collaboration, this workshop is  being
              co-sponsored by the IEEE Information Theory Society and the  Institute of
              Mathematical Statistics.
