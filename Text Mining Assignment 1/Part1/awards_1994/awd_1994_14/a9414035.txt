Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9414035  Roger Doherty    The purpose of this equipment grant
              proposal is to modernize the microscopy facility of the Mechanical Engineering
              at Drexel University (ME-DU) by acquiring an analytical scanning electron
              microscope (SEM) equipped with an EDS X-ray detector and its microanalytical
              processor.  This equipment will substitute the corresponding aging  instruments
              that are currently available at ME-DU.  This equipment is important for a large
              number of research projects, including the following:  {SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol"}
               Processing of Ceramic Polymer Nanocomposites Using Thermal spray (NSF)

              "Symbol"}  Investigation of the Micromechanics of Failure Unidirectional
              Composites Using Laser       Raman Spectroscopy (NSF)  {SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol"}

              "Symbol"}  Modeling and Microstructural Development During Spray casting (ONR) 
              {SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol"}  Recrystalization and Deformation Processing of
              Polycrystalline Metals (NSF/ALOCOA)    The currently available SEM has been
              continuously used for over 11 years and is essentially at the end of its useful
              life.    The responsibility of maintaining the machine in good working
              condition, training students in its use and driving the instrument for
              occasional non-expert users, will be assigned to the full-time technician
              currently employed by the ME-DU for the microscopy laboratory.  The technician
              is overseen by the principle investigators of this proposal.    The new SEM
              machine will also be used, as was the previous SEM, in t he senior design
              projects and teaching of undergraduate courses at Drexel in light of the newly
              developed Drexel Curriculum which has an emphasis on the laboratory experience.
