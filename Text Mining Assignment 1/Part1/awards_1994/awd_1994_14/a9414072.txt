Abstract    :
                9414072  Dufty    This award provides funds to permit Drs. James W. Dufty and 
              Christopher J. Stanton, Department of Physics, University of  Florida, to
              pursue with Dr. Chang Sub Kim, Department of Physics,  Chonnam University,
              Korea, for 36 months, a program of  cooperative research on dynamic processes
              on femto-second time  scales.  The objective of this research is to provide a
              secure  theoretical framework for a wide class of spectroscopic studies,  a
              generalization of existing theory to short times, and practical  models for
              comparisons with experiments.  Prototype systems of  interest include compound
              semiconductors of practical importance  such as GaAs an InP.  Examples of
              phenomena to be studied are  charge carrier dynamics at short times as observed
              by  femptosecond pump-probe experiments.    The proposed combination of
              experimental and theoretical  approaches will be used to provide fundamental
              information about  the physics of excited carriers in semiconductors and how
              they  impact electronic and optoelectronic device performance.  The 
              collaborators have acquired considerable complementary experience  in research
              related to the field of their proposed project.  This  project is relevant to
              the objectives of the U.S.-Korea  Cooperative Science Program which seeks to
              increase the level of  cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists and
              engineers  through the exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills,  and
              techniques and through collaboration on problems of mutual  benefit.  Korean
              participation in the project is supported by the  Korea Science and Engineering
              Foundation (KOSEF).  ***
