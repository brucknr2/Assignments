Abstract    :
              9414192    Purchase of a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectrometer    The
              Department of Chemistry at Princeton University requests  funds from the
              Chemistry Research Instrumentation and  Facilities program for the purchase of
              a nuclear magnetic  resonance (NMR) spectrometer.  Currently, the only high 
              field NMR spectrometer at  Princeton University is a seven  year old JEOL
              GSX-500.  This spectrometer is the critical  limiting factor to the following
              projects involving  Chemistry faculty members and their groups.    * Warren S.
              Warren    Recent demonstrations of intermolecular coherence transfer  between
              proteins and bulk water in solution open us a  variety of novel applications to
              enhance signals in  biomolecular NMR and imaging.  600 MHz data on a modern 
              spectrometer with high sensitivity probes and fast gradient  pulses (done in
              collaboration) have proven the importance of  the technique.  500 MHz data with
              the existing spectrometer  are essentially useless for these studies.    * Dan
              Kahne    Multi-dimensional NMR is used extensively in a major project  directed
              towards understanding DNA-carbohydrate  interactions.  500 Mhz spectra show
              severe spectra overlap  in these systems, which have been shown to be
              substantially  reduced in 600 MHz spectra.    * Michael Hecht    Systematic
              design and synthesis of novel proteins for  compartive studies of structure and
              properties depend on  multi-nuclest, multi-dimensional high-field NMR for
              complete  assignment and solution structure determination.  600 Mhz  studies
              have been started in collaborative work.    * John T. Groves    Extremely high
              sensitivity proton NMR is required for  structural investigations of small
              molecules dissolved in  phospholipid membranes, and for studies of kinetics of 
              transmembrane ligand exchange.  The current 500 Mhz is not  sufficiently
              sensitive for much of this work, which is part  of a broad program to study the
              function and dynamics of  cellular membranes.          * Jannette Carey   
              Studies of protein folding and s tabilty and the relation of  these properties
              to ligand-binding activity require access  to multi-dimensional NMR capabilties
              with the dispersion  afforded by a modern 600 MHz spectrometer.    These
              research areas, spanning biostructural and physical  chemistry, present an
              extremely diverse set of requirements  that can only be met by a 600 MHz
              spectrometer.  Moreover,  the addition of a second high field would provide
              necessary  capacity for less restrictive utilization of the existing  500 MHz
              spectrometer.
