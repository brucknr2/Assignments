Abstract    :
              Since 1869, Claflin College, a historically black liberal arts college, in
              Orangeburg, South  Carolina, has been educating minority students for
              professional attainment in all academic areas,  including the sciences.  The
              James S. Thomas Science Center is home to the Division of Natural  Sciences and
              Mathematics, which includes the departments of biology chemistry, mathematics 
              and computer Science.  Originally designed to meet undergraduate teaching
              needs, all research  and research training is conducted in the building. 
              Therefore it is critical that the college  renovate space conducive for
              conducting research activities.  With support from the Academic  Research
              Infrastructure Program, rooms presently assigned for student research will be 
              consolidated, providing an efficient and interactive arrangement.  Several
              infrastructural utilities  will be upgraded and distilled water units will be
              installed to support experiments performed in  research laboratories and the
              greenhouse.  The chemical storage facility will be upgraded to met  safety
              requirements.  The availability of sufficient research space will allow
              students and faculty  to undertake research in molecular biology, environmental
              chemistry and computer science.  The  implementation of the renovation project
              will have a positive influence on increasing the  enrollment in the sciences, 
              and improving the performance of science graduates. Preparing  graduates to
              successfully compete in graduate school will increase the pool of minority
              scientists  and role models, immediately and for the future.
