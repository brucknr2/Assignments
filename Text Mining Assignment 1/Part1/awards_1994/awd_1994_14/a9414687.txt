Abstract    :
              The University of North Dakota is the recipient of ARI funds for the  renovation
              of  infrastructural utilities and laboratory case work, in its  chemistry
              building, Abbott Hall.  The renovations are necessary to permit  undergraduate
              and graduate students to conduct their experiments in an  environment that has
              adequate ventilation and support systems.  In the  original design of the
              building, it was anticipated that fumes could be  withdrawn from the bench tops
              in laboratories by using small desk top hoods  to remove vapors.  This
              arrangement failed to remove sufficient vapors from  the laboratories over the
              years and has reduced the types of experiments that  can be performed in the
              building.  To correct the problem, 30 fume hoods,  including base cabinets and
              connections to water, electric, ventilation, and  other piped gases and fluids
              will be installed.  Accessible hoods, meeting ADA  requirements, will be placed
              in the renovated laboratories.  Improved  facilities will provide a safe and
              pleasant research training environment,  assisting the Chemistry Department in
              its recruitment efforts to attract new  students.
