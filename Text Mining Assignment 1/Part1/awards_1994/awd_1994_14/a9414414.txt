Abstract    :
              9414414  Hartnett    This U.S.-Brazil Cooperative Science Program award will 
              support a joint workshop on thermal sciences research,  hosted by Dr. James P.
              Hartnett of the Midwest Universities  Energy Consortium and Dr. Renato M. Cotta
              of the  Universidade Federal de Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to be held  in Rio de
              Janeiro in December 1994.  The focus of the  workshop will be on thermal
              sciences research and  development needs for the 21st Century.  The
              participants  will review the current status of US and Brazilian research  in
              thermal sciences, in order to identify areas of special  interest and to
              establish research priorities.    Thermal science deals with the flow of fluids
              and the  transfer of heat and mass, which are of vital concern to a  broad
              range of industries and activities on an international  scale. Areas of 
              application include petroleum and gas  production, power generation,
              manufacture of chemicals and  petrochemicals, paper making,  manufacture of
              metals, food  production, and environmental problems.  Some key  technologies,
              such as safety of nuclear power stations,  energy efficient power systems,
              production of new materials  and development of computer systems are known to
              depend  strongly on the outcome of on-going and future research on  thermal
              sciences.    ***
