Abstract    :
              9414423  Logan  This is an award to support research on the potential
              utilization  of sodium chlorate as an electron acceptor for metabolic 
              processes in microorganisms that are capable of utilizing organic  contaminants
              of soil and aquifers as a source of respiratory  carbon.  The proposal leading
              to this award was submitted under  conditions outlined in NSF 89-85, Small
              Grants for Exploratory  Research (SGER).  The investigator plans on exploring
              the use of  sodium chlorate to permit white rot fungi, known for their 
              capability of degrading aromatic hydrocarbons of pollutional  significance, to
              continue respiring after the formation of a  fungal mat at the gas/liquid
              interface inhibits or prevents the  entry of atmospheric oxygen into the fluid
              containing the  contaminants.    Results of this project are expected to
              provide the basis for  further exploration of the potential use of sodium
              chlorate as a  source of respiratory oxygen under conditions that prevent or 
              inhibit use of oxygen from atmospheric sources.  Success in that  respect is
              likely to result in application of this concept to  decontamination of soil and
              groundwater aquifers contaminated by  biodegradable organic substances.
