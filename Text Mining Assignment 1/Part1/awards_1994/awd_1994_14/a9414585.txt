Abstract    :
              9414585  Asada       In the design of high speed mechatronic systems, such as
              disk  drives, chip placement machines and three-dimensional coordinate 
              measurement machines, an integrated approach to the optimization of  mechanical
              structures, actuators and sensors together with  controllers is increasingly
              important.  There are significant  interplays and trade-offs between mechanical
              design and control  design, which must be considered carefully to optimize the
              total  system performance. This research will establish a novel method for  the
              integrated design of high speed mechatronic systems.       To overcome the
              difficulty of obtaining exact analytic models,  this project incorporates
              prototyping and experimentation into the  design process. Based on a model
              verified through experiments, the  design is modified, and its performance
              improvement is examined  through prototyping and experimentation.  This project
              forms a  closed-loop recursive process comprising design modification, 
              prototyping, and experimentation.  In each recursion, a prototype  control
              system is tested experimentally, the system model is  corrected and refined
              based on the data, design trade-offs are made  to determine an optimal design
              change, and the prototype is  physically modified in accordance with the
              determined design  change.
