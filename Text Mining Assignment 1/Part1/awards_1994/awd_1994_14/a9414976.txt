Abstract    :
              9414976  Fischer  The tribochemistry of silicon-based ceramics sliding in
              aqueous  solutions will be studied.  The results will be used to improve 
              tribochemical polishing of these materials.  The composition of  the chemical
              reaction products and their formation rates will be  determined and the synergy
              between friction processes and  chemical surface reactions will be estimated by
              conducting the  tests under a variety of conditions.  ***
