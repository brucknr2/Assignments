Abstract    :
              This grant under the Research at Undergraduate Institutions  program supports
              the development and fabrication of  superconducting thin film devices.  They
              are to be used as  detectors to record the passage of Weakly Interacting 
              Massive Particles speculated to be the eagerly sought dark  matter in the
              universe.  The new devices will detect phonons  in extremely sensitive
              superconducting tunnel junctions  sensors.  The research will be carried out at
              the  sophisticated facilities created by the P.I. with support  from NSF in
              previous years at San Francisco State  University.
