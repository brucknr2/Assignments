Abstract    :
              9414353  Hallam       The investigator and his colleagues conduct a training
              course  and research conference on mathematical ecology.  The 
              multidisciplinary course addresses ecological problems using  mathematical,
              statistical, and computational methods.  Specific  topics include   -
              population demography,   - population, community, and ecosystem dynamics,   -
              conservation biology,   - resource and agricultural management,   -
              environmental assessment and quality,   - global change,   - epidemiology and
              infectious diseases.       Ecology studies the relationships between living
              things and  their surroundings.  As with other complex phenomena, the 
              mathematical sciences help model, analyze, and understand these  relationships.
                This project introduces researchers at all levels  to mathematical and
              computational tools, mathematical formulations  of ecological questions, and
              the ecological implications of the  mathematical results.  It also fosters
              research collaborations  between mathematical and ecological scientists on
              problems  important for the sciences and for the environment.  A significant
              feature of the course is the involvement of  students, postdoctoral
              researchers, and scientists from developing  countries as well as from
              developed countries.  This grant  supports U.S. participants.
