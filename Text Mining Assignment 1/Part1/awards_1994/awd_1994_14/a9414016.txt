Abstract    :
              9414016  Ruvolo    With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Maryellen
              Ruvolo  will purchase an automated DNA sequencer system consisting of: 1.  an
              Applied Biosystems automated DNA sequencer with the necessary  software for
              editing and analyzing newly-generated sequence files  and for DNA
              microsatellite typing; and 2. a DNA data storage  system consisting of: an
              external hard disk drive for ready  retrieval and manipulation of DNA sequence
              files and a magneto-  optical drive for long-term, high stability storage of
              DNA  sequence files. The research of Dr. Ruvolo and her colleagues  uses DNA
              sequence data and the purchase of this instrumentation  will exponentially
              increase the laboratory's productivity.    Research on primate systematics and
              evolution constitutes the  focus of the laboratory's work and the team is
              currently involved  in a number of projects. These include a broad scale
              approach to  the molecular systematics of primates and a complementary effort 
              on the molecular evolution of the Strepsirhines. The group has  begun work to
              determine the genetic diversity present within  extant chimpanzees and is
              examining mitochondrial DNA sequence  and nuclear microsatellite marker
              variability in East African  chimpanzee populations. These chimpanzees are
              important because  of their endangered status as well as the extensive
              behavioral  information available on selected groups. The new instrumentation 
              will also allow the team to expand its examination of hominoid  nuclear gene
              variation and genomic structure.    Dr. Ruvolo's laboratory trains
              undergraduate and graduate  students as well as post-doctoral fellows; 
              automated sequencer  equipment will assist in this, as well as the research,
              function.
