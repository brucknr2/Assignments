Abstract    :
              9414293  Galloway    Recent modeling studies indicate that anthropogenic and
              natural  aerosols impact climate through direct (radiation absorption and 
              scattering) and indirect (cloud albedo, frequency, and extent)  effects. 
              Scavenging and removal by precipitation are the principal  sinks for
              radiatively important aerosols.  To develop a predictive  capability for the
              influence of aerosols on climate, the deposition  flux of non-sea salt (nns)
              SO4 =, black carbon, and mineral  aerosol, and the corresponding influences on
              optical  characteristics of the scavenged air parcel must be quantified over 
              space and time.         As part of Theme 2 of the Atmosphere/Ocean Chemistry 
              Experiment (AEROCE), Phase III, the University of Virginia 1)  measure the
              chemical composition of precipitation at Bermuda and  Barbados; 2) measure, as
              a function of wavelength, the optical  extinction coefficient for insoluble
              aerosol scavenged by  precipitation at the two site; 3) quantify the influence
              of  scavenging and removal by precipitation on the aerosol burden and 
              associated radiative properties of S, N, C, and mineral aerosol  over the
              western North Atlantic Ocean; and 4) provide data for the  chemical composition
              of precipitation to evaluate and refine  atmospheric model calculations
              proposed under AEROCE and as  ancillary studies to the program.
