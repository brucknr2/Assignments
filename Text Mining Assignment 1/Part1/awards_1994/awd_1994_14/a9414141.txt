Abstract    :
              9414141  Scharfstein  This research will study the response of pricing, markup, 
              investment and inventory decisions to demand fluctuations  for firms
              experiencing different degrees of liquidity  constraints. The study is divided
              into three parts. In the  first part, a model is developed that analyzes the
              effects  of external financing constraints on markups, capital  expenditures
              and inventories. The key arguments made in this  part of the study are that
              firms set prices to attract  customers and capture greater market share. If
              firms do not  have to face capital market imperfections, the markups tend  to
              be procyclical because it is easy to capitalize on a  state of  high customer
              demand to improve profit margins. If  firms face capital market imperfections,
              the markups tend to  be countercyclical. When the model is extended to account 
              for capital expenditures, we derive a general result that  shows how  borrowing
              firms tend to be less forward looking  and invest less in capital over the long
              term. The second  part of the study uses data from the supermarket industry in 
              the empirical application of the models. The main focus of  the empirical work
              is to ascertain whether firms that are  more financially vulnerable to economic
              downturns tend to  raise markups more than their less financially vulnerable 
              rivals. The third part of the study extends the basic  framework to a broader
              range of industries.  This project is of significant interest because the
              results  could improve our understanding of the interaction between  capital
              markets and product markets.
