Abstract    :
              9414360  Cheng  The 4th United States-Taiwan Multiple Hazard Mitigation 
              Symposium/Workshop will take place the 15-16 July, 1994, in  Chicago, Illinois.
               Both countries are exposed to the  consequences of natural disasters, and
              through research both have  made great strides in the mitigation of these
              effects.  For  several decades the two nations have conducted joint research 
              activities of which three workshops on multiple hazards  mitigation were of
              great interest and benefit to the natural  hazards research community.  The
              objectives of the fourth meeting  are:  to discuss the lessons learned from
              recent natural  disasters; to assess the currents state of knowledge; to
              identify  new research areas of common interest; to evaluate the decade-  long
              Taiwan's multiple hazard mitigation project; and to continue  building the
              bilateral relationship existing between the academic  and practicing
              communities.  The benefits from these activities  are the reduction in losses,
              injuries and damages, due to natural  hazards.  ***
