Abstract    :
              9414661  Dunham    This proposal supports the collaboration of Dr. Scott Dunham
              of Boston University and Dr. Kenji Taniguchi from Osaka University in Osaka,
              Japan.  Project funding will enable Dr. Dunham to spend six months in Japan,
              resident at Osaka University, in order to conduct research on process and
              device modeling with Dr. Taniguchi and other Japanese electrical engineers. 
              This project comprises two major goals.  The first goal is to gain a greater
              understanding of process and device modeling research in Japan, as well as
              current and expected future directions in VLSI technology that will have a
              direct impact on future modeling needs.  The second goal is to develop
              collaborative research with Japanese workers, at both Osaka University as well
              as at industrial research laboratories.     This proposal brings together
              research scientists from two countries working in the area of technology
              computer-aided design.  The U.S. scientist will have the opportunity to become
              familiar with research techniques and equipment at Osaka University and private
              sector Japanese laboratories.  Therefore, this proposal fulfills the objectives
              of the Program in its exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge through an
              international collaboration.  ***
