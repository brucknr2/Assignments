Abstract    :
              Professor R. Stephen Berry at the Department of Chemistry, University of  
              Chicago, is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational  
              Chemistry Program at NSF for theoretical studies of atomic and molecular  
              clusters. The work supported by this grant falls into four groups of   related
              topics: (1) The dynamical properties of atomic and molecular   clusters with
              emphasis on structural phases. (2) The chaotic and ergotic   behavior of
              clusters. (3) The relationship between the topography of   cluster potential
              energy surfaces and the formation of special cluster   structures. Of special
              significance is the study of cluster sintering.   Finally, (4) electron
              correlation in atoms and molecules, specifically   including the study of 3 and
              4 valence electron atoms.  An omnipresent   theme is that the theoretical
              studies are directly related to   experimental studies.   Clusters are special
              and unique forms of matter which lie between   isolated atoms and molecules at
              one extreme and the solid state at the   other extreme. While the properties of
              clusters are important for their   own sake, they are also important because
              they bridge these two extremes.   A long term objective of the cluster work
              which this grant supports is to   understand how cluster properties determine,
              and ultimately merge with,   bulk properties. The supported work integrates
              analytic theory,   computation, and computer simulation into an approach with
              three primary   goals: (1) deepening the understanding of commonplace
              properties of   matter; (2) identifying new properties specific to matter at
              the scale of   clusters and nanoscale particles; and (3)  stimulating new
              experiments.
