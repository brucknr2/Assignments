Abstract    :
                    With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program Professor Breslow of
              Columbia University  will develop methods that cause organic reactions to occur
              in water solutions.  Organic  molecules will be incorporated into cyclodextrin
              cavities and these complexes will be dissolved  in aqueous solutions.  This
              technique will allow the study of the effects of water on normally  hydrophobic
              reactions of organic compounds.  Cyclodextrins will be modified to contain by 
              covalent bonds biphasic organic catalysts whose ability to accelerate certain
              organic reactions  in the presence of metal ions will be studied.  The use of
              selected cyclodextrins will also allow  the determination of specific geometry
              requirements that are anticipated to occur in selected  organic reactions.  
              The goals described in the proposal are applicable to the area of 
              environmentally chemically benign synthesis.    This research will use the
              unique shapes of naturally occurring cyclodextrins, found in plants  rich in
              starch, as miniature containers in which certain organic reactions will occur
              while the  entire mixture is dissolved in water.  Many organic substances
              resist interacting with water and  exhibit hydrophobic behavior.  The use of
              cyclodextrins as containers which dissolve in water  will allow a unique study
              of the hydrophobic reactivity of organic compounds in a water  environment. 
              This research represents an important development of environmentally benign 
              chemical synthesis studies that can help to reduce pollution from manufacturing
              processes in the  chemical industry.
