Abstract    :
                   The research activity covers applications of differential  geometry and
              analysis to areas of dynamical systems, control  theory, robotics and
              biological systems. Recent advances in the  theory of geometric phase as
              applied to mechanical systems will  receive particular attention.       The
              recommended support is provided to the 19th Conference  of the University of
              Arkansas Annual Lecture series in the  Mathematical Sciences. This workshop
              will provide a forum for  interaction between researchers and graduate
              students. Besides  providing a valuable contribution to the mathematical 
              infrastructure of the US mathematical community, the activity  covers topics in
              line with the manufacturing and biological  sciences intiatives currently
              pursued by The National Science  Foundation.  ***
