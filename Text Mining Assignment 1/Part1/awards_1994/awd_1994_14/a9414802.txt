Abstract    :
              9414802  McCarthy       The award is for research aimed at a new technique for
              in-line  measurement of the shear viscosity over a wide range of shear  rates. 
              Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging will be used to  determine either the
              velocity profile or the velocity spectrum of  a fluid flowing through a tube. 
              The velocity profile is combined  with an auxiliary measurement, such as
              pressure drop, to calculate  the viscosity as a function of shear rate.  The
              velocity profile  technique will be used to determine the shear viscosity of a
              wide  range of materials.  The researchers will also work with an  equipment
              manufacturer to develop a prototype instrument based on  the velocity spectrum
              method.       The instrument developed will have an advantage over 
              commercially available equipment which either make measurements  over a single
              shear rate, require considerable time to make  measurements at multiple shear
              rates, and/or cannot generally  handle filled systems.  The work to be
              performed here is important  for process control and product analysis of
              materials like  thermoplastics, both filled and unfilled, dense slurries and 
              foodstuffs.
