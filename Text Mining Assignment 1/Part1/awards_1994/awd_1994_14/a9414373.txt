Abstract    :
                Reach  ENG-9414373  This is partial support to link the National Science 
              Foundation to an experiment in developing technical/science  literacy in future
              engineers and scientists using the  special occasion of the World (Soccer) Cup
              in the US,  linking it to the soccer ball-like Carbon-60 molecule which  is
              named "Buckyball" for its physical resemblance to the  engineering structures
              of Buckminster Fuller.
