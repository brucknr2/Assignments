Abstract    :
              9414173  Walker     The objective of this work is to provide computer
              engineering students with a current background in algorithms and software for
              computer-aided design (CAD) and test of integrated systems.  An integrated set
              of courseware and lecture notes is used in two senior-level courses on CAD and
              test.  The courseware consists of small, modular CAD and test programs with
              facilities for algorithm visualization.  The software is designed so that
              students can easily modify it and observe its internal operation, to gain
              insight into the algorithms and data structures.  Technology transfer to other
              universities is achieved through cooperation with sister institutions and
              teaching workshops.  An electronic users group provides continuous shared
              learning for instructors and students.  The courseware and lecture notes are
              implemented for easy deployment and modification, and are suitable for in-class
              demonstrations.  The outcome is graduating computer engineers who have the
              knowledge and skills to understand the operation, capabilities, and limitations
              of the latest CAD and test tools, to have the background to sensibly use such
              tools and to develop new tools.  Such students can immediately begin productive
              work in the electronics and design automation industries, and keep up with
              their rapid advances.  ***
