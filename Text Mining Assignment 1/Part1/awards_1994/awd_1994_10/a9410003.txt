Abstract    :
              This research pursues a model-based approach for visual tracking  and servoing
              in robotics.  Deformable active models are explored as  an effective way for
              tracking a rigid or semi-rigid (possibly  partially occluded) object in
              movement within the manipulator's  workspace. Deformable models imitate, in
              real-time, the dynamic  behavior of elastic structures.  These
              computer-generated models  are designed to capture the silhouette of rigid or
              semi-rigid  objects with well-defined boundaries, in terms of image gradient.  
              By means of an eye-in-hand robot arm configuration, the desired  motion of the
              end-effector is computed with the objective of  keeping the target's position
              and shape invariant with respect to  the camera frame. Optimal estimation and
              control techniques (LQG  regulator) techniques are used in order to deal with
              noisy  measurements provided by the vision sensor.  Preliminary  experimental
              results show that the deformable models help to  achieve robust tracking even
              when the target is partially occluded.  These techniques will be applied to
              assembly tasks that involve a  combination of vision and force robot control.
              Finally, the  algorithms will be tested by applying them to transportation 
              problems such as pedestrian tracking and vision based vehicle-  following.
