Abstract    :
              This research is on exploring algorithms for 3-D mechanical  component
              arrangement that derive from successful strategies in use  for 2-D VLSI
              problems.  The research approach is to develop the  critical connections and
              extensions between the core geometric  synthesis algorithms in 2-D VLSI layout
              and 3-D solid modeling that  will yield efficient mechanical shape synthesis
              tools, which  support productivity and rapid exploration of novel 3-D component
               arrangements.  Basic stochastic optimization techniques, shape 
              representations, and optimization-control techniques are being used  to:       
                * Arrange 3-D mechanical components (extending VLSI placement  strategies);  
                    * Route tubes, cables and wires in three dimensions (extending  VLSI
              routing strategies);         * Algorithms for designing to meet criteria such
              as;  vibration, thermal, space constraints, component           balance, 
              manufacturing, maintenance, accessibility, and human factors  (extending linear
              analysis methods          from circuit design);         * Support rapid
              redesign of families of products.
