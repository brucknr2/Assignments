Abstract    :
              9410068  Bentley             Establishment of the appropriate connections
              between neurons in the developing nervous system depends upon the ability of
              neurons to migrate and to extend processes accurately to distant target cells. 
              Effective guidance depends upon the ability of the tip of neuronal processes
              (the nerve growth cone) to detect guidance information and to respond by
              appropriate direction change, or steering.  The purpose of this research is to
              analyze the molecular mechanisms that underlie growth cone steering.  These
              studies will investigate the pathfinding of a single neuron in the
              methathoracic limb bud of an insect to test the hypothesis that tyrosine
              phosphorylation is involved in the steering of neuronal growth cones. 
              Antiphosphotyrosine antibodies will be injected into the growth cone and their
              effects on pathfinding will be determined. Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase
              genes will then be cloned and used to alter the function of the system.  The
              results will be of fundamental importance in understanding the processes that
              are involved in establishing connections between nerve cells during
              development, in vertebrates as well as invertebrates.
