Abstract    :
              To  investigate two architectural toolkit components  to  support  distributed  
              and  collaborative  multimedia  applications:    1)  multimedia  control  and 
              collaboration  via  distributed   event  models,   and  2)  embeddable 
              applications  as  a   high   level  replacement  for widgets.  Distributed
              event models  are  studied  and tested under different loads in three
              categories: centralized  dispatcher,   dispatcher  clusters,  and  multiple  
              dispatchers.  Collaboration  is  considered using data sharing,  input-sharing,
               and  output  sharing. The use of embeddable applications  extends  widgets  to
              both programmatic control and user interface control.  The  difference of
              embeddable applications with ordinary  widgets  is  that embeddable
              applications can be used directly or  can  be  composed into larger
              applications and then possibly replaced by a  higher   level  interface.   The 
              project  includes  the  design,  implementation,  and  test  of a general 
              embeddable  application  class along with several specific embeddable
              applications.
