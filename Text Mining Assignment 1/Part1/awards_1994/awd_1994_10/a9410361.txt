Abstract    :
              9410361  Salgado  Liquefaction of cohesion's soil deposits is one of the major 
              sources of losses as a result of earthquake strong ground  shaking.  The
              objective of this project is to develop a new  methodology for determining the
              resistance of soil to  liquefaction, based on the fundamental dependence of
              liquefaction  on soil state.  The soil state at a given site is determined from
               the results of seismic cone penetration tests.  Laboratory and  field
              experiments, together with published and other available  data, are used to
              validate the proposed methodology.    This research project has the potential
              to advance the state of  the art and the state of practice by improving the
              level of  accuracy in the determination of the resistance of a soil deposit  to
              liquefaction.  This is a Research Initiation Award.  ***
