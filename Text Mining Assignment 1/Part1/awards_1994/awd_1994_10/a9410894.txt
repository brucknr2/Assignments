Abstract    :
              9410894  Nigbor  According to 1991 Uniform Building Code certain new  buildings
              are required to be installed with accelerographs.  The project is to collect,
              quality control, and document the  acceleration time history data recorded on
              such code  accelerographs during the January 17, 1994 Northridge  Earthquake. 
              The project is also to be equally funded by the  California Strong Motion
              Instrumentation Program of the  California Division of Mines and Geology of the
              Department  of Conservation.  A report will be prepared with copies of  raw
              data, tabulation of peak accelerations, recording  station information and
              summaries of structural information  for its use by engineering and scientific
              communities.  ***
