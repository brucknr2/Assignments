Abstract    :
              9410474  Clark  An innovative active mode localization methodology is developed 
              in this research project for structural vibration control. The  approach uses
              feedback to alter the mode shapes such that those  areas of structure which are
              very delicate or critical, sense  little vibration, while other areas may
              vibrate at large  amplitudes. Both transient and steady-state vibrations are 
              controlled. This research  work includes analytical development  and laboratory
              demonstration, and emphasizes the elaboration of a  general vibration control
              technique for commonly encountered  situations in manufacturing, space,
              robotics and automotive  industries.  ***
