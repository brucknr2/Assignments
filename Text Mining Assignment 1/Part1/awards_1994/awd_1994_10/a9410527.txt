Abstract    :
              9410527  Weiss  This research program, supported in the Analytical and Surface 
              Chemistry Program, is focussed on developing an understanding  of the scanning
              tunneling microscope for determining molecular  structure and spectra of
              adsorbed species.  The effects of  local structure, defects and adsorbate
              interactions on surface  chemical and physical properties are studied in
              systems ranging  from isolated rare gas atoms and aromatic molecules to self 
              asembled monolayers and polymer films.  Instrumental  development and expansion
              of the capabilities of the scanning  probe microscope, including the
              development of the tunable  microwave frequency AC STM, form a large fraction
              of the  research effort.  Real systems of fundamental and technological 
              interest will be examined using scanning probe microscopy in  these studies. 
              %%%  Scanning tunneling microscopy has proven to be an invaluable  method for
              the examination of the detailed structure of  surfaces and molecules adsorbed
              on surfaces.  The research  supported in this program addresses the detailed
              understanding  of the imaging mechanism operative in scanning probe 
              microscopy.  A full understanding of the mechanism of image  formation will
              enable the development of improved scanning  probe methods, increasing the
              range of interesting and  technologically important surfaces and adsorbed
              overlayers  which can be probed with these methods.  This instrumentation 
              development forms a large fraction of the work supported here.
