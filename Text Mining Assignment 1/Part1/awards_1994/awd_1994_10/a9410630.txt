Abstract    :
                      This research focuses on the recovery of solvent vapors by vacuum swing
              adsorption on activated carbon.  The effects of high concentration, high
              humidity, multicomponents and other factors on performance will be examined
              experimentally.  In support of the experiments, dynamic models are to be
              developed that simulate the vacuum swing adsorption-solvent vapor recovery
              process.    Effective methods for the removal of solvent vapors are important
              to assuring the health and safety of employees in the workplace and to
              addressing environmental concerns.
