Abstract    :
              9410194  Holmstrom    This project covers three related topics in the economic
              theory  of organization: the design of incentive systems when account is  taken
              of the wide range of tasks and activities that employees  may engage in;
              financial intermediation; and a theory of trust in  face-to-face economic
              exchange. The first part explores the use  of implicit incentives and their
              interaction with explicit  incentives; the optimal design of jobs and job
              related  constraints with an eye on the current trend towards increased  worker
              empowerment and less bureaucracy; and the optimal  allocation of activities
              across firms, with the goal of  explaining where boundaries between firms are
              drawn.  The second  why firms use different sources of financing, what factors 
              influence their relative roles and how severe financial crises  affect real
              investment and the choice between funding options.   Third part explores why
              verbal promises are useful in economic  exchange.  It is well known that most
              contracts are not enforced  in court but depend on honoring one's word.  Will
              contracts be  simpler or modified in other ways when they rely on promises?
