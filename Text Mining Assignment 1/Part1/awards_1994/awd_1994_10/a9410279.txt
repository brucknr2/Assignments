Abstract    :
              This research examines the question of how synchronization affects  the temporal
              behavior of concurrent systems.  The main problem  addressed is that of
              determining tight bounds on separation times  between system events.  The
              concurrent system model used is a  directed graph whose vertices represent
              events (synchronizations)  and whose edges are annotated with delay information
              (bounds on  computation times).  The approach is to use algebraic techniques 
              for manipulating an infinitely unfolded graph to implicitly examine  the entire
              set of temporal behaviors.  The research is extending  the types of temporal
              analyses that can be preformed, as well as  extending the classes of concurrent
              systems whose timing behavior  can be efficiently verified.  Applications in
              the area of  asynchronous circuits are also being investigated.
