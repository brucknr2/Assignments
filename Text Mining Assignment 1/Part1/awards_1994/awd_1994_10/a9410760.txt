Abstract    :
              9410760 Barron   The goal of the project is the development and proof of
              computationally feasible algorithms for training artificial neural networks
              that provide accurate approximation, estimation, and classification for general
              classes of functions in high dimensions.  The analysis involves Markov chain
              convergence theory, based on a decomposition of the neural net likelihood
              function as a mixture of log-concave functions, and an information-theoretic
              analysis of Bayes estimators of neural nets.  Practical computer implementation
              will also be investigated.
