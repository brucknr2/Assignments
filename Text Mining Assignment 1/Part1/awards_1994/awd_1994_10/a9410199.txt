Abstract    :
              9410199  Veeramani       The objective of this research is to investigate
              synthesis and  algorithm issues pertaining to distributed control of large 
              manufacturing systems comprised of many autonomous intelligent  devices. 
              Several facets of distributed control will be  investigated.  One aspect of the
              research will focus on the  development of models and methodologies to
              characterize and compare  alternative distributed control architectures and
              theoretical  prediction of information and communication system performance and
               requirements.  A second aspect focuses on the development of  robust, real
              time distributed control algorithms that differ in  terms of the definition of
              customers and contractor nodes, the  nature of interaction between devices and
              the control policies that  relate to how devices decide whether to participate
              in an auction.   This aspect of research will also investigate how bids are 
              contracted and evaluated by devices, and how the devices react to  unexpected
              events.  The algorithms will be evaluated through  discrete event simulation of
              manufacturing systems models and  through emulation of such a manufacturing
              system by a network of  computer.       The research will facilitate the
              development of a new class of  high-performance intelligent manufacturing
              systems that can  possibly provide more flexibility and responsiveness to
              system  changes.  New control algorithms that enhances system performance  and
              flexibility may result from the research.  Enhanced systems  performance can
              increase the competitiveness of such a system.
