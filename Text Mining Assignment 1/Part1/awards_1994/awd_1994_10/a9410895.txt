Abstract    :
              9410895  Siddiqi  This research program is to investigate the hypothesis that 
              seismic deformations can cause, or contribute to, drain clogging  of earth
              dams, specifically, the Tampas Canyon Dam.  This dam has  been shaken by
              several significant earthquakes, including the  January 17, 1994 Northridge
              earthquake and its after shocks.    In recent years it has been observed that
              the water table  (phreatic surface) has been rising significantly at this dam
              due  to improper functioning of the inclined drains, resulting in  seepage on
              the downstream slope.  The Tampas Canyon Dam is an  earth and rockfill dam, and
              is located in San Juan Capistrano,  Orange County, California.  A complete
              geotechnical investigation  during the past three years has indicated that the
              factor of  safety under pseudo-static conditions with the existing elevated 
              phreatic surface is well below the acceptable level.  Several  borings have
              revealed significant clogging of the drains with  upstream core material. 
              Based on the results of this  investigation, it is hypothesized that the
              presence of the core  material has been caused by disruption of the existing
              bond  between the drain and the core due to seismically induced  deformations. 
              Relative displacement of the core and drain, along  with loosening of the core
              material, are thought to result in the  intrusion of the fine-grained core
              material into the coarser and  more porous drain material.  No definitive proof
              of this  mechanism has so far been found.    The objective of this
              investigation is to determine if changes in  the phreatic surface at this dam
              are caused by seismically-  induced settlements.  This is being accomplished by
              monitoring  horizontal and vertical movements within the embankment due to 
              significant aftershocks.  Piezometer readings and pool elevations  are
              monitored to determine if a rise in the phreatic  surface  occurs.  ***
