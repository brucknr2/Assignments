Abstract    :
              9410510  Ault  The proposed research is in the Undergraduate Design  Projects
              Program category, and requests support for  undergraduate and graduate student
              engineers to provide  prototype "custom designed" devices and software to aid 
              persons with disabilities.  The primary goal of this thrust  is to provide
              meaningful design experience for the  engineering student that will directly
              aid a specific  disabled individual. A formal program is in place at  Worcester
              Polytechnic Institute which will ensure  satisfactory progress is attained on
              these projects.  A  group of students and the investigators on the grant will 
              work with a number of collaborating agencies and individuals  on these
              projects. Twenty-eight projects are planned during  the five year duration of
              this award, and a written report  on the completed projects will be submitted
              for an annual  publication.  Once completed, each project will be given to  the
              person for whom it is designed.  The hope is that this  "real world" experience
              will give engineering students a  sense of purpose and pride, help engineering
              schools serve  the community, attract new students into engineering, and  raise
              student interest in graduate education.    This type of undertaking is
              important since it provides a  meaningful experience for engineering students
              as part of  their undergraduate design requirements, and will also  benefit a
              population where customization is often needed for  rehabilitation devices.
