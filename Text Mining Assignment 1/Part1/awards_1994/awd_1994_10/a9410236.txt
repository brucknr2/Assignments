Abstract    :
              9410236  Jia  The purpose of the proposed research is to develop a feasible and 
              effective approach to software development based on Z formal  specifications
              that is suitable for industrial applications.  The  goal is to synthesize
              production-quality code.  It does not  intend to fully automate the development
              process, rather to  integrate design refinement, program synthesis, software 
              components reuse, and manual development.  The proposed approach  depends on
              human engineers to make design decisions through  interactive sessions, and it
              attempts to fully automate the  implementation processes.  The key components
              of the proposed  approach include design refinement using predicate 
              transformation, refinement of loose specifications, reusing and  fine-tuning of
              generic algorithms and data structures.  The  proposed project will
              experimentally apply the proposed approach  in industrial environments. 
              Prototypes of supporting tools for  design refinement and code synthesis will
              be developed.  ***
