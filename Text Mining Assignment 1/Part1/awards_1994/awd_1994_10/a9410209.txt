Abstract    :
              9410209  Cezeaux  This Research Initiation Award proposes the study of the 
              effects of mechanical stretch and the renin-angiotensin-  aldosterone system on
              cardiac myocytes and non-myocytes in  ventricular wall remodeling in cardiac
              hypertrophy.  Of  particular interest is the hyperplasia response of non- 
              myocytes in response to angiotensin II produced locally by  non-myocytes and by
              myocytes.  A component of nonmyocytes  hyperplasia can be increased collagen
              synthesis which may be  modulated by aldosterone.  It is hypothesized that
              stretch  induces an increase in production of angiotensin II in both  myocytes
              and non-myocytes and that angiotensin II causes  nonmyocyte hyperplasia by
              paracrine and autocrine pathways.  Using a mechanical stretching device to
              apply uniaxial  stretch to cultured cardiac cells to simulate ventricular 
              pressure overload, cells will be stretched at 10% and 20%  for 24 hours. 
              Modulation of renin and angiotensin II levels  in response to stretch will be
              determined by measuring renin  mRNA by RT-PCR and angiotensin II productions by
               radioimmunoassay.    It is expected that this study will advance the knowledge
              of  the response of cardiac cells to various stimuli, an  important factor in
              tissue engineering in the cardiovascular  system.  ***
