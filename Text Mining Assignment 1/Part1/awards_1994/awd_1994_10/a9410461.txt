Abstract    :
              This is the first year of a three-year continuing Research  Initiation Award. 
              The research aims to develop a new kind of  adaptive machine for the
              orientation and presentation of small  parts in a manufacturing assembly
              system.  Such machines have the  potential for a large impact in manufacturing,
              especially in small-  batch manufacturing in the context of agile manufacturing
              systems.   The research explores the fundamental science of automation 
              required to build such a machine, including development of   appropriate
              methods for reasoning under uncertainty, machine  learning methods for design
              of feeder track reorienting devices,  and methods of automated planning for
              design of new feeder tracks.   The ideas will be tested on a prototype
              software-programmable parts  feeder for laminar parts, based on vibratory bowl
              feeder designs.
