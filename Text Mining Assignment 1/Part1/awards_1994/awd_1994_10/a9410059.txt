Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to analyze changes in the location  of
              manufacturing activity in the U.S. between 1963 and 1992 in  order to see
              whether these changes are influenced by differences  in environmental
              regulations among states.  The Census Bureau's  longitudinal Research Database
              provides information at five-year  intervals for all manufacturing plants. 
              Using these data, each  active plant in each period is categorized as opening,
              closing,  expanding, or contracting.  These data are aggregated up to the 
              state-level to create dependent variables such as the number of  newly opened
              plants in a state during a five year interval.  The  explanatory variables for
              the estimation include regulatory  measures such as enforcement activity,
              pollution abatement  expenditures, and state laws, and other factors
              influencing  location such as taxes, wages, and unionization.  This research 
              is important because it will develop a new state-level data set  on
              manufacturing activity, and it will help quantify the impact  of state imposed
              environmental regulations on the location of  manufacturing activity.
