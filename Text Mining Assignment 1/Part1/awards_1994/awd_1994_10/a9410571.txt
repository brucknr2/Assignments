Abstract    :
              9410571  Simon  The research proposed in this application is the study of 
              poroelastic models based on experimental data.  The arterial wall  is viewed as
              a deformable structure of solid components that is  saturated by a mobile
              tissue fluid and contains mobile species.  A finite strain porohyperelastic
              model will include history-  dependent finite deformation, stress, and
              transural tissue fluid  flow.  Finite strain isotropic and anisotropic
              porohyperelastic  constitutive laws will be developed based on a hyperelastic 
              strain energy density function and strain dependent permeability  that will be
              quantified using experimental data for aortic  tissue.  A two layer model will
              be developed to quantify the  hydraulic resistivity and transport properties of
              the arterial  intima and media.  Finite element models based on the nonlinear 
              porohyperelastic theory and initial linear poroelastic transport  theory will
              be developed in order to accurately represent the  complex structure and
              fluid-molecular transport in the arterial  wall.  The research will provide the
              quantitative methodology  necessary for a better understanding of the
              physiology and  mechanics of the normal arterial wall as well as for 
              consideration of abnormal states and arterial diseases such as 
              atherosclerosis.  ***
