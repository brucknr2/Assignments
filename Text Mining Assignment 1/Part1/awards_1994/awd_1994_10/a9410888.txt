Abstract    :
              9410888  Carpino    This proposal supports the collaboration of Dr. Louis A. 
              Carpino, University of Massachusetts, and one faculty member  (Dr. El-Sayed
              Mansour), one postdoctoral fellow,  and three  graduate student from the
              University of Alexandria, Egypt.  Project funding will allow the team from the
              University of  Alexandria to work for various periods of time in Dr.  Carpino's
              laboratory and also allow Dr. Carpino a research  visit to the University of
              Alexandria.  Dr. Carpino, as  Principal Investigator, will provide overall
              project  supervision.  The focus of this cooperative research  activity is the
              development of generally applicable,  reliable and rapid procedures for the
              chemical synthesis of  longer peptides and small proteins.    This proposal
              brings together research scientists from two  countries working in the area of
              peptide synthesis and  coupling.  It is anticipated that this collaborative 
              research will result in novel techniques for the synthesis  of  peptide
              segments.  The Egyptian scientists will have the  opportunity to become
              familiar with research techniques and  equipment at the University of
              Massachusetts as well as  contribute to the overall success of the project. 
              Therefore, this proposal fulfills the objectives of the  Program in its
              exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge  through an international
              collaboration.  ***
