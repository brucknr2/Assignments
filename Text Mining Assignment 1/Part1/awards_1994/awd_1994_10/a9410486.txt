Abstract    :
              Flora  9410486  This is an award to provide support for research on a novel 
              approach for biological treatment of water containing halogenated  organic
              contaminants.  The process involves use of a mixed  culture of anaerobic
              microorganisms that are cultivated on a  cathode while an electric current at
              low potential is passed  through the solution.  Formation of hydrogen on the
              cathode  produces reducing conditions at the cathode that can induce the 
              biologically mediated dehalogenation reaction.    Results of this project are
              expected to provide knowledge about a  process that has the potential of
              removing pollutants without  producing undesirable byproducts.  The
              mathematical model the  investigator plans on being able to build and
              calibrated with  experimentally determined data can be used in engineering
              design  of processes using this novel approach to decontamination of  water. 
              The proposal leading to this award was submitted in  accord with NSF 92-122,
              Research Initiation Awards Program.  ***
