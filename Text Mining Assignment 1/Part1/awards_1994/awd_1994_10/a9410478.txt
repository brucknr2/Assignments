Abstract    :
              9410478  Nagel    Technical abstract:  The relaxations in supercooled liquids
              will be  investigated by means of different spectroscopic techniques  including
              specific heat and dielectric spectroscopies, shear  modulus and quadrupole
              susceptibility. The dielectric spectroscopy  will be conducted over 14 decades
              in frequency.  The nature of the  singularity in the interface that occurs when
              a singlr drop of  liquid splits into two or more separate sections will be
              probed  using photographic techniques.  The observations will be modeled  with
              detailed numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations.   In addition,
              simulations of patterns (temporal as well as spatial)  that occur in a variety
              of geophysical contexts will be simulated.    Non-technical abstract:  An
              investigation will be carried out by  which glasses are formed by the cooling
              of a liquid.  Many  different spectroscopies will be used and compared to each
              other.   Another investigation is concerned with how a single drop of liquid 
              splits into two or more components.  This study will be done using 
              photographic techniques coupled with detailed numerical  simulations.  Finally,
              a study will be continued in which  simulations are carried out of patterns
              that occur in a variety of  geophysical contexts such as earthquakes and river
              formation.  ***
