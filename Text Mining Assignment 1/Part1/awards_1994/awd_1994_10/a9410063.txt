Abstract    :
              9410063  Li  This proposal research is to study the system architectural model 
              and system software support of network of personal workstations  (NPW)
              connected by SCI (Scalable Coherence Interface, IEEE  Standard 1596).  Oppose
              to the traditional LAN-connected NPW, SCI-  connected NPW can provide
              physically shared memory and cache  coherence among workstations across a
              network with high bandwidth  (1Gbyte/sec) and low latency (microseconds).  The
              research will  provide the understanding of the new parallel architecture which
               is highlighted by contradiction between its closely-coupled  nature due to
              shared memory and cache coherence and its loosely-  coupled nature due to the
              physical distance between workstations  and independent operations of the
              workstations.  This research  will result in models of various designs of
              SCI-connected NPW and  their comparisons, operating system designs to support
              such  architectures, and performance data based on typical parallel 
              applications.  The result will be an important step towards  inexpensive but
              powerful and widely available parallel computing  platforms.  The work will be
              done in three steps:  (1) Model the  architectural characteristics of
              SCI-connected NPE.  (2) Design  and implement operating system software
              supports based on the  hardware and applications requirements.  System level
              performance  will also be studied.  (3) Design and implement application 
              prototypes to obtain performance data.  Simulation will be used  to predict the
              performance of large scale SCI-NPWs.  ***
