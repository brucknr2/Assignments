Abstract    :
              9410645  Mooney  This Research Planning Grant was designed to aid in the 
              preparation of a proposal by the principal investigator to  facilitate
              preliminary studies in the modeling respiratory  sinus arrhythmia in the human
              fetus.  By examining the low  and high frequency regions of the heart rate
              variability  power spectra, the developmental course of sympathetic- 
              parasympathetic balance is examined.  Chaos analysis will be  used to determine
              whether the system is deterministic, and  allow a deeper understanding of the
              system.  ***
