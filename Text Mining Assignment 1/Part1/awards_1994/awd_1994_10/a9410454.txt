Abstract    :
              9410454  Hackney    The program examines the morphological stability of
              precipitates  which form in the initial stages of precipitation at the
              interface  between dissimilar materials in ternary systems.  This program is 
              unique in its focus on the lateral growth instabilities which occur  during
              initial precipitate growth perpendicular to the direction of  interdiffusion. 
              A quantitative hypothesis has been developed which  predicts how the addition
              of a third element affects morphological  development during the lateral growth
              of interfacial reaction  products.  The prediction of the ternary effect is a
              function of  the slope of the solvus with composition in an isothermal section 
              of the ternary phase diagram and the degree of resistance to  interdiffusion at
              the interface between the dissimilar materials.   A critical experimental test
              of this hypothesis is to be carried  out by studying precipitate morphology as
              the composition and  interface characteristics are varied in a systematic
              manner.  %%%  The results of this grant could impact important processes in 
              technology, such as diffusion bonding of different materials and/or  reactions
              of substrates with thin metal films.  ***
