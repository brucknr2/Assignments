Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  Julie d'Itri  CTS-9410374    The objective of the project is to
              develop new environmental technology which will allow quantitative
              determination of mass transfer rates and chemical reaction kinetics of
              gas-aerosol atmospheric systems.  An apparatus and methodology for measuring
              mass and chemical reactions rates in dispersed media will be developed.  These
              rate data are essential to accurately estimating global atmospheric changes and
              the effect of pollutants on the environment. The system will be designed to
              allow determination of gas and aerosol compositions and precision control of
              the aerosol particle diameter and composition.  The developed technology will
              be tested initially by examining the oxidation of sulfur dioxide to sulfate,
              which is the major pathway in forming sulfuric acid rain.  Mass transfer and
              chemical reaction rates will be measured and by kinetic modeling, rate and
              constants and rate expression will be established.  The relative importance of
              O3-catalyzed versus non-catalyzed heterogeneous (on aerosol surfaces) oxidation
              of  sulfur dioxide will be delineated.      The research will lay a foundation
              for better understanding and quantificatio of  the atmospheric reactions of
              sulfur containing species.  A method to determine atmospheric reactions of
              whole families of chemicals, including nitrogen oxides and organics, in
              dispersed media will be established.  ***
