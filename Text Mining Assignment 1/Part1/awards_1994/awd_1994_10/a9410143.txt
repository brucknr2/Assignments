Abstract    :
              9410143  Sastry       This is an Engineering Research Deployment Teaching
              Initiative  award to provide lecture notes and video tapes on rapid 
              solidification processing and spray deposition of high performance  materials
              to be used for transferring the university research into  industrial
              manufacturing and production. The principal objective of  this effort is to
              present in a concise and effective manner the  vast research and development
              accomplished to date in these areas.       Rapid solidification processing,
              with accompanying large  undercooling and high cooling rates, originally used
              for the study  of metastable phase formation, has emerged as a viable
              commercial  method for the production of a wide range of extended solid 
              solution alloys, dispersion strengthened alloys, intermetallics,  and in-situ
              composites.  Light weight, high strength aluminum  alloys, high strength
              steels, oxidation-resistant nickel base  superalloys, and high temperature
              alloys have been successfully  produced by rapid solidification processing. 
              The products that  result from this grant will be usable as course material for
              senior  undergraduate and graduate level students of manufacturing science  in
              universities, for short courses, and for in-house training of  materials and
              manufacturing engineers in industry.
