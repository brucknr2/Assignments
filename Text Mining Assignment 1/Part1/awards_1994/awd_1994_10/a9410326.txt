Abstract    :
              9410326  Capone   Freshwater and marine primary production are often limited by
              the availability of N, yet the characteristics of N2 fixing populations in the
              two realms differ substantially. N2 fixing heterocystous cyanobacteria are
              prominent planktonic features of N limited freshwater lakes and rivers. In
              N-limited marine waters, if N2 fixation occurs at all, it is usually restricted
              to benthic environments. The reasons for the striking differences in N2 fixer
              distributions between marine and freshwater systems are not known, but could be
              due to physico-chemical constraints such as salinity, turbulence, or other
              factors, or they may reflect sources, diversity and expression (activity) of
              allochthonous seed populations advected into the marine realm.   The contrast
              between the predominance of N2 fixing organisms in freshwater, and the apparent
              dearth of N2 fixing organisms in estuaries and oceans, provides the basis for
              the proposed research. Our primary objective is to identify and characterize
              the sources, diversity and distribution of N2 fixing genes in relation to
              environmental control of nitrogen fixation activity along a salinity gradient
              in an N-limited estuary of the Neuse River. The approach proposed here goes
              beyond the conventional analysis and interpretation of the presence or absence
              of the activity of N2 fixers by focusing on the fundamental relationships
              between the genetic potential for this activity and the environmental factors
              regulating species selection and expression of the N2 fixation apparatus.   %%%
                A novel aspect of this research is that this investigation will examine the
              importance of ecological selection factors on microbial diversity with respect
              to how, why and when natural waters can respond to N limitation with
              development of a diazotrophic community and N2 fixing activity.
