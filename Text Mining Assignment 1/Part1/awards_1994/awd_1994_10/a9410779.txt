Abstract    :
              9410779  Friesen    Many  animal  movements result from precise coordination 
              between  body  parts. The two wings of a flying bird, the four limbs of  a 
              trotting mammal, and the undulations of a swimming fish  are  all  common  
              examples   of  the  elegance  of  organized   rhythmical  movements. 
              Coordination of limb movements and  body  musculature  results  from  internal 
              coordination between  sets  of  neuronal  oscillators  that  control 
              individual  appendages  or  segments.  Neuronal  oscillators are sets of nerve
              cells that interact  with  each other to generate rhythmic changes in the
              electrical signals  of  these  nerve cells. Neurobiologists have learned a lot 
              about  how  these individual neuronal oscillators work, but know  little  about
               how  the  oscillators work together  to  produce  rhythmic  movements.  This 
              proposal is to study how  the  interconnections  between  neuronal oscillators
              in the leech produce intersegmental  coordination during swimming. Mathematical
              and computer models of  intersegmental  coordination  of  this 
              well-characterized   swim  neural  network  will be developed. Because  of  the
               fundamental  similarity of rhythmic movements in all animals, insights  gained
               from this study on a complex, yet tractable, nervous system of  a  lower 
              animal should be applicable to the more complex  and  less  tractable  nervous 
              systems that produce  rhythmic  movements  in  higher animals.
