Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry   Division,
              Prof. L. Peteanu of the Carnegie-Mellon University will explore   the
              possibilities of a combined Stark-Raman effect to investigate   vibrational
              mode couplings in the neighborhood of the curve crossings of   excited
              electronic states.  The Stark-Raman technique would provide an   ability to
              determine the effect of an (external) electric perturbing   field on the
              vibrational displacements in the excited states of   photochemically active
              molecules.    Previous attempts to observe the influence of an externally
              impressed   field on the Raman spectrum of a molecule were unsuccessful and
              this   field has lain dormant for more than 40 years.  The present research is 
               to explore this essentially unknown field.  With the superior theoretical  
              and experimental techniques that are now available, there are valid  
              expectations that a new area of molecular spectroscopy will be developed.    If
              sucessful, the Stark-Raman technique  will be useful in situations   where the
              usual techniques of infrared absorption and resonance Raman   spectroscopy are
              inadequate.
