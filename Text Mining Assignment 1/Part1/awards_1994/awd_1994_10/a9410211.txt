Abstract    :
              SUMMARY OF PANEL DISCUSSION    Proposal Number:  CTS-9410211  P.I.:  W. Chapman 
              Institution:  Rice University     The problem addressed here is the development
              of new, more successful statistical mechanical models for electrolyte
              solutions.  Existing models (beyond Debye-Huckel) belong to two categories: a)
              "primitive models" (PM) where the solvent is treated as a continuum and b)
              "civilized models" (CM) where the molecular nature of the solvent is taken into
              account.  The PI's plan consists of improving existing CM models and successful
              primitive models (like the "Sticky Electrolyte Model") and testing them by
              molecular simulations.  Furthermore, he plans to develop appropriate integral
              equation theories at his level of modeling.  According to the PI, these
              improved models have the flexibility to describe complicated electrolyte
              systems (e.g., non-spherical ions and polyelectrolytes).  -The PI is very
              knowledgeable and well-versed in his area, and his past work is highly
              regarded.  -The plan of the proposed work should have been more detailed,
              especially in the direction of polyelectrolytes which is the most promising. 
              -The PI is in a very competitive group and therefore he must excel in order to
              distinguish himself among his peers.
