Abstract    :
              In the proposed effort, the PI will continue the operation of the  cosmic ray
              neutron monitors at Mt. Washington and Durham through  the next modulation
              minimum (1996-97), as well as continuing  studies which relate ground-based
              cosmic ray observations to near-  Earth cosmic ray telescope data.  Specific
              problems the PI intends  to investigate are:  (1) the interplanetary cosmic ray
              radial and  latitudinal gradients; (2) location of the termination shock and 
              cosmic ray modulation boundary using cosmic rays; (3) significance  of the
              correlation of the cosmic ray intensity charges and the  heliospheric current
              sheet; (4) recovery phase of the 11-year  cosmic ray intensity cycle; (5) the
              22 year cycles...comparison of  the intensities at successive intensity maxima;
              (6) rigidity  dependence of transient decreases; and (7) solar cosmic ray
              events.
