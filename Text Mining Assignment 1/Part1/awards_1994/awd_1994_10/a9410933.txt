Abstract    :
              9410933  Mel    This collaborative project between a young theorist and two 
              experienced experimentalist to test a new theory of what  happens in the brain
              during learning..  The theory says that  learning in the mammalian cortex is
              guided by a balance  between two distinct mechanisms.  One is the continual 
              activity-independent changes in the connections between  neurons (called
              synapses) that tend to randomize the place  on a neuron where an incoming
              afferent neuron establishes  its connection.  The second is an
              activity-dependent process  in which the connections of afferent neurons that
              are active  at the same time are stabilized if they happen by chance to  be
              close together.  This means that groups of frequently co-  activated inputs to
              the brain come together to form  neighboring synapses and, therefore, have a
              more powerful  effect on their target neurons.   This theory will be tested 
              experimentally by looking anatomically at the spatial  arrangement of afferent
              synapses on target neurons when the  afferent neurons are artificially induced
              to have correlated  activity.  The theory will also be tested by simulating
              this  type of biological experiment on a computer.  The outcome of  these
              studies promises to have a significant impact on the  way we think about how
              the brain does the computations that  allow us to learn complicated patterns.
