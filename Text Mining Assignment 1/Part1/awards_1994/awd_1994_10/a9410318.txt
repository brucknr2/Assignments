Abstract    :
              9410318  Nemhauser       To use MINTO in its current form, a user would need to 
              customize it through application routines.  Such user is expected  to be an
              expert in mixed integer programming.  The task in the  deployment activity is
              to develop a methodology that would allow  the customization of the package by
              a user without expecting such  a user to be vastly knowledgeable on mixed
              integer programming.  In  addition to the development of the user interface
              module to MINTO,  the deployment activity includes the intensive use of MINTO
              in two  graduate level courses and holding of workshops for industrial 
              practitioners and academics.  Student groups will be defined and  problems of
              different types and structures will be identified for  solution through MINTO. 
                   The objective of this project is to develop a deployment route  for
              teaching MINTO to students and transferring it to industry.   MINTO is a
              general purpose, mixed integer optimization program that  the principal
              investigator developed as a result of a prior NSF  sponsored research project.
