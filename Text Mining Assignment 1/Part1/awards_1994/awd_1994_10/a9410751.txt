Abstract    :
              9410751  Miller  This project is on research to develop improved bioreactors for
               hematopoietic cell culture.  This will involve an examination of  how flow
              patterns and transport characteristics within perfused  flat-bed reactors
              influence cell metabolic requirements.  The  four specific objectives of this
              research are: (1) to  characterize the metabolic requirements of hematopoietic
              cells;  (2) to enhance the productivity of current bioreactors by  improving
              the design for enhanced transport, cell seeding, and  cell feeding rate; (3) to
              evaluate alternative bioreactor  designs, including stirred cultures and hollow
              fiber cultures;  and (4) to scale up the most promising system for clinical 
              trails.  ***
