Abstract    :
              9410874  Kareiva       Corridors for animal dispersal are being increasingly
              examined  as a management option for reducing the risk of extinction in 
              threatened species.  The idea is that these corridors encourage  genetic
              diversity by the exchange of individuals between different  regions, and offer
              a vehicle for recolonization of local  populations that might go extinct due to
              chance catastrophes.   While corridors could clearly in theory be a
              cost-effective means  for promoting biodiversity, their biological efficacy is
              not  established.  In fact, ecologists have not even devised a clear  protocol
              for evaluating corridor effectiveness.       This research will assess the
              effectiveness of habitat  corridors for a threatened species in Oregon, where
              in fact local  governments are considering establishing corridors.  Protocols
              will  be developed for converting observations of how animals move  through
              habitats into predictions about the likely value of  corridors in conservation
              efforts.  Small-scale experimental  corridors will be created and individuals
              will be moved into  different habitat types (or edges between habitat types)
              for  observations of movement behavior.
