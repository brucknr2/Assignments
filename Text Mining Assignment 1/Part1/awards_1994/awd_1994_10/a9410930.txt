Abstract    :
              9410930  Tung       A summer school on quantum chromodynamics (the theory of the
               strong nuclear force) and its implications for experiments in  elementary
              particle physics will be held August 10-18, 1994.  the  school will promote a
              knowledge of quantum chromodynamics, whose  predictions are important for very
              many experiments in particle  physics, among younger scientists, including both
               experimentalists and theorists.  ***
