Abstract    :
              9410695  Thonnard       This award provides funding for the development of a 
              laser-based resonance ionization spectroscopy technique  capable of measuring
              the isotopic abundances of noble gas  constituents krypton-81 and krypton-85 in
              natural samples.  The project is to be carried out in the Institute for Rare 
              Isotope Measurements at the University of Tennessee.       Accurate
              measurements of the radionuclei of krypton-81  and krypton-85 can contribute to
              a better understanding of  processes in the environment, including dating of
              polar ice  and very old groundwater, deep ocean circulation rates, and  modern
              water flow patterns. These isotopes have half-lives  of 210,000 and 10.8 years
              respectively and are found in  natural samples with isotopic abundances usually
              less than a  part per trillion. Accurate analysis is a problem that has  not
              yet been solved. The PI and colleagues on this project  will develop a
              multi-step technique aimed at achieving an  analytical procedure capable of
              measuring hundreds of  environmentally significant samples per year.  *** 
              9405805  Craig       This award provides 75% of the funds required for the 
              acquisition of a microscope system for use with transmitted  and reflected
              light to be used in the rare gas isotope  laboratory, Scripps Institution of
              Oceanography at the  University of California, San Diego. The University is 
              committed to providing the remaining funds necessary for the  acquisition.     
               The microscope system is mainly to be used by  researchers working with fluid,
              glass, and crystalline  inclusions trapped in samples of basaltic rocks that
              have  been extruded from the Earth's mantle. The microscope is  needed for the
              location and identification of these small  inclusions prior to extraction of
              the rare gases (argon,  helium, and neodymium) for isotopic analysis. The 
              researchers at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography are  using the isotopic
              content of the rare gases brought up from  the mantle to understand the
              geochemical evolution of the   mantle.  ***
