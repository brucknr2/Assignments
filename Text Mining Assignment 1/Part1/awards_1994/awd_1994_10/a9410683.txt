Abstract    :
              9410683  Songer  The objective is to develop an automated prediction tool for 
              public sector agencies to select appropriate projects for design-  build
              facility acquisition.  At the core of the tool is a  analytical model which
              predicts the probability of success for  projects selected for design-build. 
              The model will be built  using two techniques, multiattribute analysis and
              logistic  regression.  The model will be built using case studies from 
              previous design-build projects of Building Research Board  members.  Rigorous
              testing of the model and tool will be  performed by comparing predicted to
              actual project performance.  Design-build acquisition methods are relatively
              new to public  sector agencies.  Providing a tool to select appropriate
              projects  for design-build will significantly enhance current selection 
              processes.  Appropriate project selection will greatly improve  public sector
              competitiveness in facility acquisition.  ***
