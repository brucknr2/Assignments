Abstract    :
              This Research Opportunities for Women Reseach Planning Grant (ROW/RPG) in   the
              Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program supports the research   efforts of
              Professor Robin Helburn of Northern Arizona University which   are aimed at
              characterizing environmentally important humic materials.    The focus of this
              research is the characterization of the hydrophobic   binding properties of
              these dissolved and colloidal phase materials using   spectroscopic dyes.  A
              series of polarity-sensitive indicators will be   used to probe the relative
              lipophilicity of binding environments in   natural humic acids, and in lignin-
              and petroleum-based surfactants, all   of which have solute transport
              capabilities.  In a separate study, these   indicators will be used to monitor
              the formation of organic aggregates as   induced by divalent cations.    This
              project combines the PI's background in environmental analytical   chemistry
              and her expertise in chemometrics with her interest in these   complex
              heterogeneous substances.  In addition to initiating this female   scientist's
              research program in environmental chemistry, support of this   project will
              complement the established undergraduate research program at   Northern Arizona
              University.
