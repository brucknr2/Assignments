Abstract    :
              9410886  Janardhan    Description: This project supports Three Indian 
              scientists, Dr. A.S. Janardhan of Mysor  University, Dr. T.C. Devaraju of
              Karnatak  University, and Dr. B. Mahabaleswar of  Bangalore University, to
              collaborate with Dr.  Robert Newton of the University of Chicago, and  Dr.
              Edward Hansen of Hope college, Holland, MI.   The research will continue
              investigations of  the late Archean deep-crustal section of  southern Karnataka
              and northern Tamil Nadu,  India, following on an earlier NSF-supported  project
              of Dr. Newton.  The orthopyroxene  isograde ("Fermor's Line") will be
              investigated  as to causative mineral reactions, areal  continuity, geochemical
              progression, and  evidence for the role of infiltrating fluids in  the Archean
              deep crust.  The major thrust of  the project will be the elucidation of the 
              early history of a continent.     Scope: The U.S. collaborators are well 
              respected geologists with long experience in  Indian geological research.  They
              are qualified  to accomplish their scientific objectives by  collaborating with
              the Indian scientists who  live and work in southern India, where the  field
              work is planned.  The area of the  research is important to the Indian and the 
              U.S. sides.  This project fully meets INT  objectives.  ***
