Abstract    :
              Mueller  9410281   This proposal describes experiments for studying the
              evolution of population stability.  The experimental research described will
              utilize Drosophila  melanogaster as a model organism.  Specifically, 20
              populations will be created to study the evolution of life histories that
              affect the stability of a population around its carrying capacity.  Two source
              populations will be used: the UU populations that have been kept at low larval
              and adult densities and the CU populations that have been kept at high larval
              and low adult density.  Each of these populations, which is replicated
              fivefold, will be kept in two different environments: the HL environment
              provides high levels of food for larvae but low levels to adults, and the LH
              environment, which provides low levels of food to the larvae and high levels to
              the adults.  The LH environment has been shown previously to produce cycles
              about the equilibrium point.  The stability properties of these populations
              will be determined in the LH environment at the start of the experiment and
              after 24 generations of selection.  Additionally the populations will be
              sampled periodically for life history characters that are known to respond to
              density-dependent natural selection that are important for the stability of the
              population.  These characters include, (1) larval feeding rates, (2) larval
              pupation height, and (3) female fecundity in the LH environment at high adult
              densities.
