Abstract    :
              This research is on the use of partial scan for system test.  The  goal is to
              find solutions that do not sacrifice fault coverage.   The main problem
              addressed is: given a sequential circuit, find the  minimal set of flip-flops
              that are to be included in the scan chain  while maintaining complete or 100%
              fault coverage.  The approach is  to define a metric, "profit", for a
              particular scan chain  configuration.  This metric is equal to the probability
              that the  required states for testing the target faults will be obtained  using
              deterministic test generation techniques.  Various  optimization techniques are
              being used to find the scan chain  configuration that has large profit. 
              Algorithms for using this  technique are being developed into a test tool.
