Abstract    :
              The project is aimed at developing a run-to-run process control  system for
              quality enhancement of semiconductor manufacturing  process.  Based on
              post-process and in-situ measurements on product  wafers, low order polynomial
              process models are suggested as a way  of adjusting recipes that can increase
              the process qualities with  minimal disruption to the production process.  The
              proposer has  demonstrated some of his methodology in industrial applications.
