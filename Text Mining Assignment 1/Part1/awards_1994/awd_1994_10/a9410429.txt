Abstract    :
              9410429  Bryers  This project is on research to  develop biomaterials that
              prevent  the adhesion and subsequent growth  of bacterial cells to these 
              materials.  The four specific aims  of this research include: (1) the 
              preparation and characterization of  polyurethane substrata with surface 
              coatings for the controlled release  of antibiotics and antiadhesives;  (2) the
              preparation of an alternate  surface coating technique by plasma  deposition of
              ethylene glycol  oligomers at the polyurethane  surface; (3) a study of the 
              kinetics of bacterial adhesion to  the newly created material  surfaces; and
              (4) an examination of  the rates and mechanisms of  bacterial attachment in the
               presence of blood platelets.  The  results of this research could have  impact
              on the prevention of  bacterial infections for medical  implants.  ***
