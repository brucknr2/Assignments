Abstract    :
                This research pursues the development of a formal semantics for  real
              implementations of functional languages, modeling sharing  and cycles, and  for
              parallel functional languages with state.    Traditionally both the 
              operational semantics and the compilation  process of functional languages are 
              given by translating  them to either the lambda-calculus, combinatory logic  or
              abstract  reduction systems.  However, these computational models do not 
              capture sharing and direct recursion, and thus are inadequate for  reasoning 
              about compiler issues and implementations.  This  research develops a  sound
              theory for cyclic structures  involving lambda abstraction.  The need for  new
              mathematical  foundations arises when state is introduced in functional 
              languages.  Previous theories apply only to languages with  sequential 
              semantics.  This research seeks to provide a framework  for reasoning about 
              state in a parallel setting by extending the  above graph calculus.
