Abstract    :
              9410411  LIU       Ice cores drawn from glaciers provide an important source of 
              information about changes in climate, vegetation, and other  phenomena over
              tens of thousands of years.  Analyses of oxygen  isotopes can generate proxies
              for temperature, and analyses of  soluble and insoluble aerosols can provide
              indications of wind  strength and direction, volcanic activity, and drought. 
              Measurement of the thickness of annual ice layers yield valuable  information
              about precipitation patterns.  Pollen contained  within ice cores has not been
              studied as extensively, but these  fine particles offer great potential as
              sources of information  about past patterns of vegetation.  This collaborative
              research  project will extract a long-term pollen record with a high  temporal
              resolution from ice cores extracted from the Dunde Ice  Cap in western China. 
              This pollen record will supplement other  climate proxy data to provide a
              detailed regional history of  changes in the climate and related variables over
              the last  100,000 years.  Special emphasis will be placed on the use of  these
              data to examine vegetational responses to monsoon  circulation changes induced
              by changes in the Earth's orbit.  Analyses also will be undertaken to consider
              vegetational  responses to cooling during the "Little Ice Age" and to 
              greenhouse gas-induced warming during the late Pleistocene and  Holocene
              periods.       This project will provide valuable new data to facilitate  the
              reconstruction and analyses of climatic changes over the last  100,000 years. 
              Because subtropical glaciers like the Dunde Ice  Cap contain far more pollen
              than do glaciers at higher latitudes,  they permit examinations with relatively
              great temporal precision  of changing patterns of climate and vegetation.  They
              also  provide valuable sources of data regarding current rates of  change, and
              these data can be used to help validate a number of  different climatic models.
