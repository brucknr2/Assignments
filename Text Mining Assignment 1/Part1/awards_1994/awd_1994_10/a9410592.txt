Abstract    :
                Is there a fundamental set of rules by which we can  design and  analyze
              portable algorithms for locality and/or efficiency?  This  project continues
              work towards a model of parallel computation  that captures  locality for wide
              classes of parallel computers.  Theoretical tools are developed that can be
              applied to gain a better  understanding of the following:  (1) Parallel
              Algorithms --- how to design and analyze  architecture  independent generic
              algorithms capable of exploiting  abstract-locality for wide classes of
              parallel models;           (2) Calculus of Architectures --- how to develop a
              calculus that,    given such a generic algorithm, identifies  necessary and/or 
              sufficient characteristics of the parallel models for which  the  problem can
              be solved with prescribed levels of abstract-locality  and/or  efficiency;  
              (3) Parallel-Performance Limitations --- how to discover those  levels of
              abstract-locality, speedup, and efficiency which cannot  be, or are  highly
              unlikely to be, achieved by any such parallel  algorithms for a given  problem.
              These tools are tested by applying them to design and analyze  portable
              algorithms, and to prove parallelism limitations, for  fundamental 
              combinatorial problems.
