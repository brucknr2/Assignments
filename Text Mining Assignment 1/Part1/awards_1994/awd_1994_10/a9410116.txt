Abstract    :
              9410116  Elnozahy  The objective of this project is to develop a software
              monitoring tool that would allow the collection of performance data under
              realistic workloads and network activities. Unlike other hardware and software
              monitoring tools, the new tool can collect long execution traces with very
              little perturbation to the actual system. The duration of monitored execution
              is estimated to be orders of magnitude longer than has been possible using
              existing techniques. The implementation takes place entirely in software and
              relies on the instruction counters that are increasingly becoming common with
              modern processors. Because the execution of the system is not affected by the
              monitoring process, the processing can be applied for collecting very long
              traces while the system is in use. This will permit more ambitious performance
              studies than have been possible today. The monitoring tool can also be used for
              debugging purposes during the final testing phases of programs to uncover
              intermittent errors. These errors, known as Heizenbugs, are the most difficult
              to discover and are the reason for the perceived unreliability of systems
              software. ***
