Abstract    :
                    9410482  Wathugala  A general numerical procedure based on the strain path
              method,  mixture theory and non-linear finite element method will be  developed
              that will simulate pile driving, subsequent consolidaiton  and pile load tests.
               This numerical method will be verified by  simulating laboratory tests.  An
              instrumented pile segment model  which can continuously measure and record
              shear transfer, pore  pressure and total radial pressure will be fabricated and
              tested.   Four clay samples with different overconsolidation rations, 
              confining pressures and drainage conditions will be studied in  these tests.
