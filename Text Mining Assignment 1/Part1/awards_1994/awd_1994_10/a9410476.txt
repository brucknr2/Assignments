Abstract    :
              Raskin  9410476  This is an award to provide support for research on the causes 
              and control of foaming in aerobic and anaerobic, suspended growth  bioreactors.
              The investigator plans on designing oligonucleotide  rRNA-targeted probes that
              are specific for identifying several  foam-causing microorganisms.  The probes
              will be used to study  and characterize the conditions that lead to foaming and
              the  microbiological flora associated with foaming in bioreactors that  are
              used in waste treatment processes.    Foaming is a problem commonly associated
              with bioreactors used in  wastewater treatment processes and in the processing
              of residuals  produced during the treatment process.  The foaming problem is 
              frequently associated with conditions that result in dominance by  filamentous
              microorganisms in the reactors.  Results of this  research are expected to
              provide new insights into the causes of  foaming and the potential for its
              control.  This knowledge is  expected to be applied in improving the operation
              of existing  bioreactors and in improving the engineering design of systems 
              utilizing bioreactors.  The proposal leading to this award was  submitted in
              accord with NSF 92-122, Research Initiation Awards  Program.  ***
