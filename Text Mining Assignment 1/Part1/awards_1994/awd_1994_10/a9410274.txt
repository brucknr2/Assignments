Abstract    :
              9410274  Odum    SGER:  Retrospective Analysis of Long Term Ecological Studies:
              A Search for Common Denominators in Ecological Theory  %%%  Using the
              informational base of The Institute of Ecology at the University of Georgia,
              the PI will examine the monitoring aspects of long term studies and the use of
              these studies in discovering and testing ecological principles and developing
              new models and theories.  The study will address such questions as research
              productivity, area oriented versus problem oriented studies, applications to
              real world problems, the role of graduate and post graduate students in long
              term studies, etc.  The study will use four approaches: (1) a survey of
              published papers; (2) a survey of knowledgeable scientists in the field; (3)
              citation analysis; and (4) a review of positions held and accomplishments of
              former students associated with long term projects.%%%  %%%  The analysis of
              the role of long term ecological research in the development of new ecological
              theory is important to the historical and scientific development of ecology. 
              This synthetic and integrative approach will offer new insights into the
              current status of ecological theory.
