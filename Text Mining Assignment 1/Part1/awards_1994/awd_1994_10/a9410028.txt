Abstract    :
              The shared memory computation model provides an attractive  alternative to the
              message passing model such that the techniques  learned from parallel
              computations can be applied to distributed  computation problems.  In a
              distributed environment, node failures  are more often than in a
              tightly-coupled multiprocessor system due  to man-made downtime.  The fault
              recovery issue should be dealt  with in order to make the shared memory
              computation model feasible  for distributed environments.    The objectives of
              this project are (1) to develop a low overhead  concurrent checkpointing scheme
              with a controllable checkpoint  interval and no global synchronization; (2) to
              design a recoverable  distributed shared memory system based on the new
              checkpointing  scheme; (3) to build an experimental system to examine the 
              engineering issues related to building such systems; (4) to  evaluate different
              checkpointing schemes, with benchmark  applications; and (5) to explore
              potential distributed  applications, based on shared memory computations.
