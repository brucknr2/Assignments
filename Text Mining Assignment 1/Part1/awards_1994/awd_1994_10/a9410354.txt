Abstract    :
              9410354  Stankovic  The use of power electronics in general, and of switching
              power  converters in particular, is pervasive, widespread and critical  to the
              success of much of modern technology.  Current standard  practice in power
              converters operation is based on the generation  of periodic switching
              functions.  Periodic switching policies are  energy efficient, but can require
              extensive filtering, and can  produce excessive acoustic noise in motor
              applications, due to  interactions of harmonics with mechanical structures. 
              The  purpose of this project is to mitigate these and other related  effects
              through the development of a unified design procedure for  randomized switching
              waveforms in power converters.    The starting point for the proposal is a set
              of recently proposed  randomized switching schemes, where a stochastic signal
              with  appropriately chosen statistical properties is added to the  reference
              switching function.  Randomization then alters the  frequency content without
              affecting the proper operation.  The  proposed development of design procedures
              for switching governed  by Markov chains will further enhance this approach by
              enabling  time-domain adaptation and wave-form optimization in both time  and
              frequency domains.  The new approach is also practical and  interesting for
              manufacturing, as it does not require any major  hardware changes in existing
              equipment.   ***
