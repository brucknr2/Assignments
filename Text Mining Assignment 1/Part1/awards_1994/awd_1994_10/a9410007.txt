Abstract    :
              9410007  BEBCHUK  This research includes four projects in the economic analysis
              of  law.  Two projects will be in the area of corporate law and  corporate
              bankruptcy, and two projects will be in the area of  litigation and settlement.
               In the area of corporate law and  corporate bankruptcy, the Principal
              Investigator will first analyze  transactions in which controlling blocks in
              corporations are  purchased.  The second project will examine the consequences
              of  providing secured creditors with full priority in bankruptcy.  In  the
              litigation and settlement area, one project will consider suits  that are known
              to be made solely to extract a settlement offer.  In  the second project, the
              Principal Investigator will examine the  strategic effects that lawyer-client
              fee arrangements can have in  bargaining over settlement.    To analyze these
              issues, the Principal Investigator will develop  econometric models to test the
              formal assumptions underlying each  problem.
