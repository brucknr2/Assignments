Abstract    :
              9410882  Simpson       Graduate student Karen Clary, under the supervision of
              faculty  adviser Beryl Simpson at the University of Texas, is studying the 
              taxonomy and phylogeny of the desert genus Yucca, estimated to  encompass ca.
              35 species in Mexico and the U.S.  Morphological,  anatomical, and molecular
              (DNA) analyses are being conducted to  provide comparative data for assessing
              genealogical affinities.   The internal transcribed spacer region of the
              nuclear ribosomal DNA  repeat will be sequenced to determine mutational
              differences in  nucleotide composition among species.  Results from nuclear DNA
               analyses will be compared to those based upon chloroplast DNA  studies for the
              same species.  Molecular and morphological  characters will be combined to
              achieve a reliable classification of  the plants.       An understanding of
              patterns of diversity in molecular and  morphological features in Yucca will
              provide answers about the  origin of the genus and its evolution in relation to
              desert  conditions, in general, and in particular should prove interesting 
              when compared with phylogenetic data on yucca moths, the chief  pollinators of
              these plants.
