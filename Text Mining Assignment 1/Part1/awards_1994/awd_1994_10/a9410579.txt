Abstract    :
              9410579  Glanzman    The goal of this project is to explain the mechanisms of 
              learning and memory in an invertebrate animal, the sea slug  Aplysia.  The
              sensory and motor neurons which mediate  certain simple defensive withdrawal
              reflexes of Aplysia can  be removed from the animal's nervous system and grown
              in  cell culture; here they will reform their original  connections (called
              synapses).  These synapses in cell  culture are ideal for analyses of the
              mechanisms of learning-  related changes in the strength of the synapses. 
              Recently,  these researchers found that the synapses formed between  Aplysia
              sensory and motor neurons in culture exhibit a long-  term change similar to
              that which occurs at synapses in the  vertebrate nervous system and which is
              thought to mediate  associative learning.  This synaptic change is known as 
              "long-term potentiation" (LTP).  This project will analyze  the cellular
              mechanisms of LTP in the Aplysia synapses in  cell culture and determine
              whether LTP of sensorimotor  synapses mediates classical conditioning of
              Aplysia's  withdrawal reflex in the whole animal.  The hope is that an 
              understanding of how the relatively simple nervous system of  Aplysia mediates
              learning will help advance our  understanding of how the far more complex
              nervous systems of  mammals mediate more sophisticated forms of learning and 
              memory.
