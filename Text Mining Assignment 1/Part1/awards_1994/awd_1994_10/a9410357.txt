Abstract    :
              NCR 9410357  University of South Carolina  Suresh Singh  RIA: Networking Issues
              in Mobile Computing    In the near future mobile users will be able to access a
              wide  variety of services that have so far been available only to users 
              connected to fixed networks.  Mobile users will be able to access  data while
              on the move.  Numerous problems from diverse areas such  distributed data
              management, security, networking protocols, etc.  have to be solved to enable
              this environment.  The focus of this  work is on identifying and solving a wide
              range of networking  problems such as developing practical network
              architectures to  support mobility, protocols to manage mobile connections in
              ways  that guarantee uninterrupted service, defining quality of service 
              guarantees and ensuring graceful service degradation in situations  where user
              demands exceed the network's capacity to satisfy them.   The problem areas
              targeted in this work are fundamental to  developing workable mobile computer
              networks.  The approaches  undertaken are practical in the sense that they will
              hopefully lead  to engineering solutions that will be incorporated into actual 
              designs in the future.  An attempt will be made to provide  solutions which
              will facilitate easy integration of the mobile  networks into the high-speed
              networking technology in the fixed  plant.
