Abstract    :
                  EEC-9410393  Engineering Academy of Southern New England    The Engineering
              Academy of Southern New England is an industry/state/university educational
              alliance with industry having a strong hand in guiding the programs of the
              Academy through membership on the Academy Governing Board and several councils.
               Core activities of the Academy are in curricula development - to integrate
              manufacturing practices, processes, and principles throughout the undergraduate
              curricula; increasing accessibility - filling the engineering pipeline,
              especially with underrepresented minorities and women; post baccalaureate
              education - tailored to maintain the technical currency of practicing engineers
              and those reentering the work force; and implementing an information and
              education network - to facilitate distance learning and sharing of technical
              resources.
