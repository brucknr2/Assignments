Abstract    :
              ATM-9410685  Portman, David  Atmospheric and Environmental Research Inc.  Title:
              Effects of Urban Heat Islands and A Refined Surface Database  for China   
              Utilizing the archived primary datasets the PI will construct  distinct time
              series of urban and rural surface temperatures for  each climatic region in
              China, and will adjust the urban  temperatures to remove the heat island
              biases.  These regional time  series will constitute a refined climatological
              database, which the  PI will document and make available to the general climate
              research  community through a national data center.  The PI will also compare 
              the variations in time series of urban and rural temperatures  averaged for all
              of China with those in some other time series of  large-scale regional,
              hemispheric, and global average temperatures.    Quality assurance of the
              surface data from China is not readily  ascertained by use of conventional
              methods, such as those that  reply on abundant station history information.
              Results of this  research will therefore provide an important basis for further
               assessment of potential inhomogeneities and urban heat island  effects in
              surface data from China and other parts of the  developing world.    This
              research is important because it evolves methods of producing  clean and
              quality research datasets for global change studies.     This grant is funded
              under USGCRP GEOSYSTEM DATABASE program.
