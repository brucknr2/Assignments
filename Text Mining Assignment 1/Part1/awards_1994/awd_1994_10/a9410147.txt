Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9410147  Nicholas Abbott/U. Cal @ Davis    Studies of
              water-soluble surfactant molecules have, in the past, largely concentrated on
              systems in which the amphiphilicity of each surfactant was fixed at the time of
              its synthesis; at fixed temperature, pressure and composition, the properties
              of systems containing these surfactants are invariant.  The research proposed
              here moves to active control of amphiphilicity, and aims to explore
              molecular-level principles to change, in situ and reversibly, the
              amphiphilicity of  molecules and thereby control the surfactant-based
              properties of solutions and interfaces.  Amphiphiles with redox-active groups
              that change hydrophilicity with oxidation state will designed and synthesized. 
              Electrochemical and photochemical techniques will be used to control, in situ,
              the oxidation states of  redox-wettability, micellization, and macroscopic
              phase-behavior of their solutions.  The  proposed research aims to develop the
              capability to cycle, on time-scale of seconds, properties of aqueous surfactant
              solutions and to direct changes in amphiphilicity to specific regions of a
              solution or interface thereby creating spatial gradients in their
              surfactant-based properties.  The fundamental relationships between the
              molecular structures of surfactants and their collective properties will be
              investigated.
