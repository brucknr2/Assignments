Abstract    :
              9410120  Herman  This award will support a workshop involving academic 
              scientists and federal agency liaisons to plan a new  initiative in
              environmental geochemistry.  The initiative  will provide earth scientists with
              a mechanism by which new  ideas and new approaches to environmental studies are
               fostered.  The research conducted under the proposal  initiative is expected
              to increase our knowledge and  understanding of basic mechanisms and processes,
              at many  different scales of space and time, that comprise the broad  topical
              field of environmental geochemistry.  Such research  is essential for the
              well-being of the global environment  and to mitigate the environmental
              consequences of human  activities.
