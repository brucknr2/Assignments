Abstract    :
              9410846  Sandorfi       A Gordon conference will be held in the series on 
              Photonuclear Reactions at Tilton School, Tilton, NH July 31-  August 5, 1994. 
              This meeting will focus on topical questions in  nuclear physics, including the
              structure of baryons, quark sub-  structure in nuclei, the charge structure of
              the neutron, the  response of nuclear systems to different probes,
              multi-nucleon  correlation studies, meson exchange currents and relativistic 
              effects, and finally fundamental symmetries.  Many young people  and many
              leaders in the field will attend, both from the US and  abroad.  ***
