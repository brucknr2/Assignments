Abstract    :
              9410711  Kennan    This project aims to provide an evaluation of the empirical 
              relevance of strategic bargaining models.  The ultimate goal is  to develop
              theoretically coherent empirical analyses of important  policy issues in
              collective bargaining.  The strategic importance  of private information has
              been emphasized in many recent  theoretical models, with applications in many
              fields.  It remains  to be seen whether this large body of theory has much
              empirical  substance.  The analysis of labor contracts is a good test-bed, 
              since interesting theories have been proposed, and good data are  available.   
              A serious limitation of the recent literature is that each  contract is treated
              in isolation.  In practice, labor  negotiations involve contracts covering
              several years, and the  parties seem mindful of how the outcome of the current
              contract  will affect negotiations on the next contract.  There is strong 
              evidence that the likelihood of a strike is influenced by what  happened before
              the previous contract was signed: a short strike  last time means that the
              probability of a strike now is about  40%, while if there was either a long
              strike or no strike last  time the current strike probability is below 20%.  To
              analyze  whether private information might explain this pattern, a model  of
              negotiations between a buyer and a seller will be developed  where the "pie" to
              be divided in each contract follows a Markov  chain, with transitions that are
              observed privately by the buyer.   Each negotiation consists of a sequence of
              offers made by the  seller; the buyer can only accept or reject each offer, and
              a  contract is signed as soon as the buyer accepts.
