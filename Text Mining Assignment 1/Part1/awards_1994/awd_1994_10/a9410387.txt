Abstract    :
              9410387  Mathiowitz  The research proposed in this application is concerned with
               the development of a new magnetic method to study  bioadhesion between
              individual polymeric microspheres and  living segments of gastrointestinal
              tissue, in vitro.  The  adhesion forces will be measured by quantifying the
              magnetic  force required to hold an iron-loaded microsphere  stationary, while
              the adherent tissue is separated at a  constant rate.  X-ray imaging of
              animals, which have been  fed microspheres loaded with radio-opaque materials,
              will be  used to determine the location and duration of contact of  the
              microspheres with target structures, in vivo.  A focus  of the project will be
              to correlate adhesive forces  determined in vitro with GI residence time in
              vivo.  In  addition, the use of bioadhesive microspheres to improve  drug
              delivery to ulcerated GI tissue will be evaluated.  ***
