Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  Joseph Ryan  CTS-9410301    The transport of low-solubility
              contaminants like radionuclides, metals, and hydrophobic organic compounds is
              directly linked to the transport of colloids.  The diffusion-driven release of
              Brownian colloids from porous media surfaces is influenced by the chemistry of
              the colloid and porous media surfaces, the solution chemistry (pH, ionic
              strength), the flow velocity, and the colloid and grain sizes.  In the past,
              the kinetics of colloid release were modeled as a first-order exchange between
              attached and detached colloids in a manner analogous to Arrhenius kinetics. 
              Under certain conditions, this approach has failed, owing to peculiarities in
              the calculation of the intersurface potential energy.  Preliminary experimental
              results have indicated that colloid release is actually a two-step mechanism
              consisting of (1) detachment from the surface controlled by surface and
              solution chemistry and (2) diffusion across the boundary layer controlled by
              the effect of flow velocity diffusion coefficient.  The experiments proposed
              here are designed to proof the two-step mechanism by attempting to isolate and
              quantify each step.  The detachment step will be isolated by conducting
              experiments in non-moving fluid.  The diffusion step will be isolated by
              removing the energy barrier.  The results of the experiments will be analyzed
              to develop a quantitative kinetic model of colloid release.    The project
              addresses environmental concerns in groundwaters.
