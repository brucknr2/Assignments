Abstract    :
              This project will investigate a coherent cache parallel computer in  chich
              decisions on a particular cache block are based upon the run  time history of
              the particualr instruction accessing the block will  be undertaken.  The cache
              management scheme will detect and exploit  a variety of insturction behaviors. 
              The system could have certain  sinstructions invalidate after reading, force a
              cache block to be  copied to another processor, or, on a miss, bring in a cache
              block  with a predetermined invalidation time.  These will result in fewer 
              messages and lower latency.  In the proposed reserch each of these  techniques
              will be developed in detail and evaluated using  execution driven simulations. 
              The results will establish the  efficacy of the technique which can be used to
              improve the  performance of a wide range of aprallel computers from office 
              fileservers to supercomputers.
