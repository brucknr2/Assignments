Abstract    :
              9410880  Haber  This Dissertation Improvement research examines the economic 
              consequences of legal institutions within the transitional  economy of
              Porfirian Mexico during the period of 1876-1911.  The  study will analyze the
              institutional framework for economic  activity and the contractual relations
              between government and  private enterprise in a state where institutional
              reform was  implemented to eliminate traditional constraints to industrial 
              innovation and economic growth.  One set of legal institutions,  the federal
              New Industries (IN) act of 1893, will be examine to  see how the government
              allocated and adjudicaton property rights.   Hypotheses about how well Mexican
              property rights were defined  and whether Mexico business was highly
              politicized will be tested  and an analysis completed of the effects of
              property rights  policies on investments levels and the competitive structure
              of  industry.  In sum, this project will re-examine the Mexican  political
              economy using theoretical tools of the economic theory  of property rights. 
              Data will be collected through examining  extant legislation, congressional
              debates and newspaper  commentaries to ascertain the intentions of those who
              established  and administered public policy regarding property rights and 
              economic promotion.  The complete administrative records of the  IN program
              available in the Mexican national archive and  supplementary materials in the
              notarial and judicial archives  will also be used. In addition, data will be
              collected from the  financial press.
