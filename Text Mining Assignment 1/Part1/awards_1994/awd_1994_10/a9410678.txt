Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9410678  California Institute of Technology  P.I.: Anthony Leonard
                   This equipment will permit the establishment of a state-of-the-art
              scientific visualization laboratory.  The principal goal is to provide a high
              speed link between a Paragon parallel computer and SGI workstations.  This will
              allow visualization and postprocessing of the large data sets produced by the
              parallel computer.  This facility will support several on-going research
              projects including:  studies in vortex dynamics of turbulence, analysis of
              dynamical systems with several degrees of freedom, studies of vortex-based
              model of turbulence fine scales and calculations of hypersonic flow of
              chemically reactive gases.
