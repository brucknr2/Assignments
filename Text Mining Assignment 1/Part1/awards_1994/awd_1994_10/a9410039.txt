Abstract    :
              9410039  Hall  The research will focus on three related projects. The first 
              project will study the determinants of productivity across  the states of the
              United States. The cross-state analysis  attempts to assess the role of
              geographic proximity as a  determinant of productivity. The model also accounts
              for  cross- state spillovers and spillovers from different types  of goods. The
              second project will study variations in  productivity across countries with a
              host of explanatory  variables. The main emphasis is on examining the
              importance  of rent-seeking behavior on productivity. The third project  will
              examine the creation of value within manufacturing  corporations in the United
              states and will investigate the  extent to which various aspects of corporate
              governance  affect the creation of value within corporations. The  emphasis in
              this part of the study is on examining the role  of variables such as the size
              of the board of directors, the  role of the management of the board, and the
              incentive  programs for managers, among others things, in creating  value.     
               This project is important because it promises to  provide results that would
              greatly enhance our understanding  of differences in productivity across states
              in the United  States and differences in productivity across countries.
