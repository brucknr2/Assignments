Abstract    :
              9410906  Schwarcz    With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Henry
              Schwarcz will  continue research on electron spin resonance (ESR) dating of 
              prehistoric archaeological and hominid sites. ESR dating can  provide dates
              over the range from a few thousand to more than two  million years. It is based
              on the principle that some materials  found at archaeological sites store a
              physical record of the  amount of radiation to which they have been exposed.  
              Tooth enamel, which is found at virtually every archaeological  site, displays
              a characteristic ESR signal which increases in  intensity with exposure to
              radiation, and which has zero  intensity in modern teeth. One can
              experimentally determine the  dose rate at the site where the enamel was
              recovered, and the  equivalent dose that was absorbed by the enamel to produce
              the  observed ESR signal. The ratio of these quantities provides the  age of
              the tooth, and thus the time of occupation of the site.  The precision of the
              dates is +- 5 to 10 %. The McMaster    Laboratory is the only one in North
              America carrying out ESR  research and has successfully applied the method to
              many sites in  Europe, Asia and Africa. With NSF support research will continue
               to refine the ESR technique itself. Dr. Schwarcz and his  colleagues will also
              analyze and provide dates for a range of  significant anthropological
              specimens.
