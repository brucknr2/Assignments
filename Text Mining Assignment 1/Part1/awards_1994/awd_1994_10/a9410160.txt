Abstract    :
              The cognitive capacities of infants are evident in the way they use   reaching
              to manipulate and explore their environment.  Infants demonstrate  
              considerable capacity to adjust their reaches to different tasks, and to   use
              particular strategies to solve particular tasks.  At present it is not   clear
              why infants use particular ways of reaching in different situations,   or why
              the kinematics of reaching changes so dramatically during   development.  The
              present proposal suggests that infant reaching kinematics   are mainly
              determined by the internal constraints imposed by the infant's   lower-level
              motor systems and by the external constraints imposed by the   task.  The
              current proposal suggests that infant motor planning can be   modelled as the
              development of a plan to control a stochastic dynamical   system representing
              the lower-level motor systems.  This formulation of the   planning problem,
              together with a small number of testable assumptions,   predicts motor
              behaviors, and spotlights the aspects of the reach that are   most important in
              controlling the arm, and guides experimental design.  The   proposed research
              examines the kinematics of infant reaches in several   tasks and compares the
              infant's movements with movement plans predicted by   a mathematical model. 
              The research tests whether adults will adopt   infant-like strategies when
              forced to execute movements with a model of the   infants lower-level motor
              systems.
