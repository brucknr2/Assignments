Abstract    :
              9410215  DiMilla  The overall objective of this project is to apply a
              radial-flow  chamber and SPR microscopy to identify the effect of variations 
              in the molecular adhesive properties of a supporting substratum,  the
              receptor/ligand interaction, and the extent of cell spreading  during
              attachment on the strength of adhesion and the mechanism  of detachment of
              mammalian cells from model organic surfaces.   Molecular-level insight into
              receptor/ligand-mediated cell  adhesion phenomenon is necessary for optimizing
              many current  biotechnologies, including cell affinity chromatography, for 
              developing novel biomaterials for use as supports for tissue  culture and
              artificial organs, and for implementing new clinical  therapies for treating
              diseases involving pathological adhesive  behavior.  ***
