Abstract    :
              9410144  Wilson  In this project, an analytical modeling methodology and
              automated  modeling tool is developed for electromechanical systems. The 
              methodology acknowledges and incorporates the inherent  uncertainty involved in
              models. The tool accepts a component-  based description of an
              electromechanical systems as input. These  component descriptions, including
              tolerances, are mapped in to  models whose perameters have tolerances,
              uncertainty bounds are  determined for both component and system models, and
              optimal  order of system models in determined. In conventional models, 
              component dimensions and material constants are approximate,  whereas model
              coefficients are assumed constant.  ***
