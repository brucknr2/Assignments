Abstract    :
              9410967  Weggel  The Department of Civil & Architectural Engineering at  Drexel
              University will purchase a water-wave generation/data  acquisition system which
              will be dedicated to support  research in coastal engineering.  The equipment
              will be used  for basic coastal engineering research on waves, coastal 
              processes and coastal structures in Drexel's existing 2-D  wave flume. 
              Initially, the research will focus on studies  of cross-shore sand transport
              under beach-building waves and  on the onshore transport of nearshore bars such
              as might be  constructed as beach nourishment by bottom dump dredges.  This
              research is important for the economic design of beach  nourishment projects
              and for the evaluation of their  performance.    Subsequent studies will
              address the functional performance  of coastal structures including the
              sand-structure  interaction of perched beach structures (nearshore sills)  and
              seawalls.  Sand transport through rubble-mound  structures by wave agitation
              and the presence of a sand  level gradient across the structure will also be 
              investigated.    The wave generation system will include active wave 
              absorption to reduce the re-reflection of waves from the  generator paddle so
              that 2-D studies of beach profile  evolution in the presence of structures can
              be conducted.  ***
