Abstract    :
              9410654  Longoria  In this project,innovative techniques are developed for
              modeling,  analysis and synthesis of systems and processes using scattering 
              variables. The scattering approach can represent dynamic  phenomena described
              by variables that take on values  which can  be continuous or discrete in
              amplitude and/or time. In  engineering, scattering techniques are most
              prevalent in  microwave circuit design and classical network theory. This 
              existing knowledge is extended to include multi-energy domain  devices and
              processes in the context of mechanical engineering  systems. In particular, the
              scattering technique is used to  facilitate the analysis of systems with
              interacting lumped and  distributed parameter elements. Additionally, the
              scattering  approach is developed for dynamic modeling and analysis of 
              discrete flow processes.  ***
