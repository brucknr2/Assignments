Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9410994  University of Massachusetts Amhers  Peter Monson      The
              Department of Chemical Engineering at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst,
              will purchase computer graphics workstations which will be dedicated to support
              research in engineering.  The equipment will be used for several research
              projects on molecular and materials modeling, including in particular:    1.
              Modeling absorption equilibrium in porous and heterogeneous solids;  2.
              Theoretical studies of solid-phase thermodynamics and solid-fluid equilibrium
              for    non-spherical molecules and mixtures;  3. Analysis of transition-state
              structures and reaction theory in gas kinetics;  4. Mechanistic modeling of
              plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition;  5. Coupling agents at the adhesive
              interface; and  6. Molecular simulations of nanophase materials.   
              Visualization of molecular, surface, and bulk atomic structures is central to
              the analysis of these systems.  The four co-PI's bring together an unusual
              combination of expertise in molecular and materials modeling for chemical
              engineering, exploiting statistical mechanics, molecular simulation and ad
              initio quantum chemistry.  The graphics workstations will help them create new
              insights, foster synergistic collaborations, and educate chemical engineering
              students in the use of computational chemistry and molecular structure.
