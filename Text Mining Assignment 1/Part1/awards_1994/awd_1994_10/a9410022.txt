Abstract    :
              Abstract  Howard Hu  CTS-9410022    This project is an experimental and
              numerical investigation for motion and interactions of rigid particles in
              non-Newtonian fluids.  The experiments will be performed with particles of
              different shapes in sedimentation and suspension systems of polymer solutions. 
              The numerical simulation will be based on a finite element package which
              handles the unsteady and non-linear coupling of the motion between fluid and
              solid particles.  The effects of non-Newtonian properties of shear-rate
              dependent viscosity, normal stress differences and elasticity of fluids on the
              motions and interactions of particles will be examined, and the mechanisms that
              control the behavior of particles in those non-Newtonian fluids will be
              identified.  Five topics are outlined in this study:  (1) stable orientation of
              long particles sediments in non-Newtonian fluids; (2) particle-wall
              interactions and wall effects on particle motion; (3) equilibrium position and
              migration of sedimenting and suspended particles; (4) interactions between
              particles and flow induced structures; (5) flow of fiber suspensions.   
              Results of  these project will contributed to the fundamental knowledge of
              dynamics of non-Newtonian fluids, and to the modeling of flows of polymeric
              liquids with suspended particles.  They will find through the use of polymer
              solutions.  ***
