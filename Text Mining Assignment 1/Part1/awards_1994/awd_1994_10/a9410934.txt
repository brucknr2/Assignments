Abstract    :
              9410934  Quinn    In order to understand the molecular basis of learning, it
              will be necessary to (1) identify the genes which influence learning
              performance, (2) determine in which brain cells they are active, and (3)
              describe what happens when they are switched on or off.  Dr. Quinn's lab has
              identified a mutant fly ("radish") with specific learning deficits, and will
              now proceed to identify the gene which produces altered learning performance in
              flies of this phenotype.  With this information they will be able to identify
              the product of the radish gene and begin to determine the mechanisms by which
              the product acts to influence the learning process.  This will have great
              significance for understanding both the neural and genetic factors that
              influence the modifiability of an organism's behavior.
