Abstract    :
              9410399  Alford  This investigation will study the low temperature oxidation of
              Si in contact with Cu-Silicide.  The kinetics of the phenomena,
              characterization of the oxide layer, and use of the orientation dependence on
              growth rate to form vertical isolation oxides in integrated circuits shall be
              investigated.    At room temperature Cu-silicide forms an oxide layer between
              the Si and silicide interface when exposed to air.  The oxide layer grows to a
              thickness of several microns in a period of weeks.  The growth kinetics, will
              be characterized to obtain activation energy, substrate orientation, identity
              of moving species (use of implanted makers), and influence of dopants and
              impurities.    The integrity of the growth oxide will be quantified by
              electrical measurements (MOS capacitor structures, I-V, C-V), ion-beam analysis
              (composition, density, and impurities), and transmission electron microscopy
              (microstructure).  ***
