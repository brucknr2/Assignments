Abstract    :
              9410795  Gayen  The objective of the proposed research is to develop tunable
              solid-  state lasers which will operate in the near-ultraviolet, and blue- 
              green spectral regions.  The strong, broad-band fluorescence that  results from
              5d-to-4f vibronic transitions in trivalent rare earth  ion-doped crystals is
              particularly suitable for the four-level mode  of laser operation in these
              wavelengths.  Since the 5d electrons  are strongly coupled to the host lattice,
              a careful choice of  active ions (Ce3+, Pr3+) and host crystals would be used
              to optimize  the 5d-to-4f fluorescence, and to simultaneously minimize the 
              detrimental effect of excited-state absorption.  The properties of  the
              absorption, excitation, and fluorescence spectra, fluorescence  lifetime and
              intensity would be used to extract key spectroscopic  parameters which are
              pertinent to laser action, such as absorption  and emission cross sections,
              oscillator strengths, radiative and  nonradiative decay rates and line
              strengths.  Laser-pumped lasing  experiment would be conducted to demonstrate
              laser action in  promising crystals.  Detailed measurements of output 
              characteristics, quantum electronic properties and loss mechanisms  would be
              undertaken.  The goal is to be able to formulate the  selection and design
              criteria for these crystals.  The results of  this project would have an impact
              on such diverse areas as  underwater laser communication, optical storage,
              cytometry and  biotechnology, as well as the development of phosphors for 
              radiologic imaging and scintillators for radiation detection.  ***
