Abstract    :
              Figueroa  9410343  This is an award to provide support for research on the
              potential  removal of uranium from aqueous solution by its precipitation as 
              the oxide after a reduction process resulting from actions of  mixed cultures
              of sulfate-reducing bacteria.  The investigator's  hypothesis is that
              bioreduction is the dominant mechanism for the  process which is augmented by
              solution characteristics such as  initial concentration of the uranium, ionic
              strength, pH,  presence and concentration of adsorption sites and presence of 
              other redox couples.    Results of this project are expected to be a better
              understanding  than now exists of the  contributions that bioreduction, 
              biosorption and chemical reduction have on the process by which  uranium is
              initially reduced and then precipitated from solution.  This knowledge is
              expected to be used in the engineering design  of bioreactors for removal of
              uranium from contaminated water and  wastewater.  The proposal leading to this
              award was submitted in  accord with NSF 92-122, Research Initiation Awards
              Program.  ***
