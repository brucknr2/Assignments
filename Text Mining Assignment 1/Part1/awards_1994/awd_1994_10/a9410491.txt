              Title: Long-term Dynamics of the SW Indian Monsoon: New High-  resolution
              Paleoclimatic Data from Tibet    This award supports a U.S.-China collaborative
              project to produce  several new high-resolution paleoclimatic records from the
              Tibetan  Plateau for the last 20,000 years.  These records are vital to an 
              understanding of the long-term dynamics of the SW Indian monsoon,  which is an
              important component of the global climate system.  This  effort will
              reconstruct the climatic and vegetational history of  the Tibetan Plateau by
              means of pollen, isotopic, and  paleolimnological studies and AMS-dating of
              sediment cores to be  retrieved from small lakes in the southeastern part of
              Tibet, a  region of steep climatic and vegetation gradients.  These high- 
              resolution paleoclimatic records will be used to clear up  disagreements
              between the few existing Tibetan Plateau records, and  to test a number of
              hypotheses.
