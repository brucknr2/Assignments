Abstract    :
              9410872  KAREIVA       The ecological landscape in today's world is becoming 
              increasingly characterized by a checkerboard-like mosaic of diverse  habitats
              encompassing urban, agricultural, and natural  environments.  Ecologists have
              yet to devise a general theory  pinpointing the effects, and more importantly,
              the mechanisms  behind the effects that mixed landscapes may have upon resident
               populations.  The investigators have chosen to conduct a field  experiment in
              which non-crop vegetation (e.g. weeds) is  incorporated into a crop field.  The
              experimental design includes  varying mixtures of crop and weed at different
              scales as well, so  that investigators can determine the usefulness of such
              mixtures in  a variety of general farmland scenarios.  The data from these 
              experimental field tests will be incorporated into different  mathematical
              models, in the hopes of elucidating the mechanisms  operating in the field. 
              This mix of empiricism and theory will  lead to a protocol for determining, in
              any given setting, how and  at what scale mixing landscape types may affect
              insect populations.         Incorporating data obtained in field experiments
              into  mathematical models will generalize to many different real-life 
              scenarios in which organisms move through combinations of diverse  landscapes. 
              Any such general guidelines combining agricultural  production and natural
              vegetation should be an important  contribution ln light of the current trend
              towards increasing  landscape fragmentation as well as increasing population
              pressure.
