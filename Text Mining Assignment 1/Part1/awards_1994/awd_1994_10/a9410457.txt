Abstract    :
              9410457  Adve  The objective of this research is to develop and evaluate 
              techniques for reducing the impact of synchronization latency in  shared-memory
              multiprocessors.  Recent trends indicate that  future microprocessors will
              employ aggressive techniques (e.g.,  multiple instruction issue, dynamic
              scheduling) to exploit  instruction-level parallelism.  Current shared-memory 
              multiprocessors, however, usually require a processor to stall on 
              synchronization reads until the read completes, precluding the  full
              exploitation of future uniprocessors.  The research studies  two approaches for
              reducing the impact of synchronization  latency:  (a) overlapping latency of
              explicit synchronizations,  and (b) using implicit synchronization (where
              possible) to  eliminate synchronization latency.  The key components of the 
              study will be: (1) a practical hardware technique based on  guarded
              instructions for overlapping acquire operations, (2)  alleviating
              implementation overheads incurred with implicit  synchronization by using a
              novel combination of explicit and  implicit synchronization, (3) determining
              information in the form  of high-level annotations that programmers can provide
              to enhance  detection of instruction-level parallelism, and (4) a  quantitative
              evaluation of the efficacy of the above techniques  using extensive
              instruction-level simulations of real  applications.  This research is a
              necessary step towards enabling  wider acceptance of parallel machines because
              it will enable  machines to be more cost-effective by exploiting more fully the
               potential of next-generation microprocessors, and will broaden  the supported
              class of applications by allowing the efficient  execution of finer-grained
              applications.  ***
