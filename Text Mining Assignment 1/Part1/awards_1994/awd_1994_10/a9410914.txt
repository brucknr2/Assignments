Abstract    :
              9410914  DeGrandpre    Research will be undertaken in response to a one-time
              Program  Announcement (NSF 93-101) for the Coastal Ocean Processes  (CoOP)
              Coastal Air-Sea Chemical Fluxes pilot study.  The  NSF/CoOP Study will augment
              and collaborate with the  ONR-sponsored Marine Boundary Layer (MBL) Advanced
              Research  Initiative (ARI) project scheduled for 1995 off the  coast of 
              Monterey, California.  The overall scientific project is  interdisciplinary,
              with the NSF/CoOP efforts addressing  chemical and biological parameters, while
              the ONR study  focuses on physical oceanographic and meteorological 
              parameters.     This project focuses on concentrations of pCO2, O2 and noble
              gases  in relation to the interdisciplinary framework of biological,  chemical,
              physical, and meteorological experiments to be conducted  by other scientists
              during the MBL ARI.  Air-sea gas exchange  mechanisms and upper ocean gas
              dynamics will be studied by  measuring multiple gases (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe)
              at different  depths in the water column.  This suite of noble gases will
              enable  the investigators to discern air-sea gas exchange from other  physical
              processes such as advection and heat exchange.  Also, by  making measurements
              at different depths, the effects of vertical  mixing on surface concentrations
              can be directly estimated.    Complementary meteorological, physical and
              chemical data to be  taken during the MBL experiment will be used to ultimately
               determine the physical forcing and constraining mechanisms on air-  sea
              chemical exchange in the coastal region.
