Abstract    :
              Advanced materials processing techniques demand precise thermal  and
              environmental control for the development of optimum  microstructures and
              properties. The knowledge of chemical and  structural transformations in the
              materials is critical. This  research grade thermal analysis system will have
              significant  immediate impact on research programs in materials science and 
              engineering.  The instrument will be used in individual and  collaborative
              research programs, and will be available to the  entire research community and
              the University of Washington. This  instrument includes a simultaneous
              Differential Thermal Analysis  (DTA) and Thermo-Gravimetric Analysis (TGA)
              unit, an in-line Mass  Spectrometer, a gas-flow control and mixing unit, an
              oxygen  gettering furnace, an on-line measurement gauge, and computer  control
              for data acquisition, analysis and display. Research  projects include
              materials processing, thermodynamic and kinetic  stability and material
              performance. This instrument will be the  core of a planned thermal analysis
              laboratory, and will be  available to interested local industries.
