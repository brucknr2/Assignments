Abstract    :
                9410626  Jackson  This research will examine how commercial bank deposit rates
               respond to changes in market interest rates, and how the  speed of response
              depends on market characteristics. The  empirical study uses data on the
              interest rates banks set  for different types of deposits. The empirical models
               control for the way banks in different localities change  prices in response
              to changes in national Treasury Bill  rates, and allow for the possiblity that
              banks determine  service quality, among other things.       This project is
              significant because it provides results  that would be a useful contribution to
              our knowledge of the  importance and determinants of price rigidities in the 
              banking industry.
