Abstract    :
              9410900  Pisias  This two-year award will support initial planning activities
              for  a new initiative of the U.S. Global Change Research Program, MESH  (Marine
              aspects of Earth System History).  MESH-related research  will address
              questions concerning the role of the ocean in  climate change on time scales
              ranging from 10 to 100,000 years,  primarily as recorded in marine sediments. 
              Results of MESH  research will address hypotheses concerning the long-term
              natural  variability of the ocean/climate system, and will be applied to 
              testing and verifying predictive models of climate change under  altered
              conditions.  A draft science plan has been generated by a  steering committee
              elected by a cross-section of the research  community.  Planning activities
              supported by this award will  include workshops to develop the science plan, by
              defining  priorities and milestones for research, and publication of a 
              newsletter and reports.  ***
