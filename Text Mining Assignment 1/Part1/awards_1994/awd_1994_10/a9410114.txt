Abstract    :
              9410114  Carlson       Designing multi-energy systems that have transient
              performance  specifications is a time consuming undertaking that requires a
              wide  range of knowledge, including system design, modeling, dynamic  analysis,
              computer programming, and optimization.  The purpose of  this research effort
              is to reduce the time required to design and  optimize these types of systems
              by addressing the area of catalog  design.  In catalog design an engineer will
              develop a configuration  using component types to perform a given task or
              function.  Once  the configuration has been determined, specific components
              from  manufacturers' catalogs are selected so that the system performs  the
              desired task as specified by the design specifications.       The goal of this
              research is to develop methodology to design  a configuration and select an
              optimal set of components for this  configuration to perform a specified task. 
              The resulting  methodology will be tested on a computer system. The success of
              the  research will represent a step forward in the development of more  widely
              applicable computer-aided design tools, as the methodology  developed should
              apply across a wide range of systems and should  handle systems with transient
              performance specifications.
