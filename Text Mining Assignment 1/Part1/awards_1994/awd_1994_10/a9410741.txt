Abstract    :
              This is the first year of a three-year continuing Research  Initiation Award. 
              The resarch aims to develop theiries and  techniques of automatic learning for
              object recognition from 2D  images.  Visual recognition is recognized as a
              veruy difficult task  due to large image variations, high complexities, and a
              huge amount  of data in the images that computers muyst deal with in the real 
              world.  Automatic learning is crucual for achievement of versatile  and
              reliable vision systems.  The new approach to learning in this  research
              project is general, flexible, adaptive, and efficient.   The proposed methods
              will be tested on a large number of real-world  images to recognize learned
              objects and identify their locations in  the images.
