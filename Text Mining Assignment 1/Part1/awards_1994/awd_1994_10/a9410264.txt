Abstract    :
              9410264  Rockwell    This research collaboration is to test the hypothesis that 
              geomorphic features offset the same amount formed in the same  number of
              earthquakes, and that features offset different amounts  along the same segment
              of the fault were offset in different  numbers of earthquakes.  The area of
              study will be the Garlock  Fault in southern California.  Previously, these
              hypotheses were  used to estimate the number of earthquakes associated with
              features  offset different amounts along the Garlock fault.  However, lessons 
              learned from the 1992 Landers, California earthquake show  violations of these
              hypotheses.  A more detailed study of offsets  and dating of features along the
              Garlock fault should provide new  evidence relating to the idea of
              "characteristic earthquakes" which  has in the past been a cornerstone of
              seismic hazard estimation.   This research is a component of the National
              Earthquake Hazard  Reduction Program.  ***
