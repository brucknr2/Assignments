Abstract    :
              This grant is to support a dissertation project.  The purpose of  the project is
              to develop and analyze a dynamic structural model  of investment behavior using
              data on the timber purchase and  harvest decisions of wood products firms in
              the Pacific  Northwest.  The project has three goals: first, to better 
              understand the determinants of firm investment, particularly the  effects of
              uncertainty, and asymmetric adjustment costs; second,  to extend the rapidly
              growing literature on methods of solving  and estimating models of this type;
              and finally, to further  enlighten the policy discussion now taking place about
              the  relative importance of environmental and economic factors in the  future
              use of forest lands.  A tractable econometric model will  be derived which is
              closely connected to theory and which  incorporates important features of the
              industry.  A rich and  extensive data set will then be used to estimate the
              model and  recover structural parameters.
