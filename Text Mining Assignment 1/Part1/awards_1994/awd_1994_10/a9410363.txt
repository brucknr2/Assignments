Abstract    :
              9410363  Nies  This is an award to provide support for a project, the overall 
              objective of which is to study interactions of reductive  dechlorination of
              chlorinated organic compounds and the  biomethylation of metals mediated by
              microbial coenzymes.  The  investigator plans on doing this in three
              overlapping periods,  the initial one of which will characterize the
              experimental  conditions under which methylation of metals like mercury occurs 
              in a defined chemical system.  He then plans on examining the  methylation of
              metals when combined with reductive dechlorination  under similarly defined
              chemical conditions followed by  determination of the rates at which these
              processes occur  individually and combined in anaerobic sediments.    The
              decontamination of air, water, soil, sediments and sludges  containing mixtures
              of pollutants, each of which requires a  different removal or transformation
              procedure, poses a special  problem in the engineering design of processes and
              systems that  are aimed at restoration of the useful qualities of the 
              contaminated media.  Results will provide guidance for  engineering design of
              processes to decontaminate environmental  media contaminated by mixtures of
              heavy metals and chlorinated  organic compounds.  The proposal leading to this
              award was  submitted in accord with NSF 92-122, Research Initiation Awards 
              Program.  ***
