Abstract    :
              9410768  Beck  Research will be carried out in high energy electron scattering 
              with the goals of determining the contribution of strange quark  to the nucleon
              charge and magnetization distribution.  A new  magnetic spectrometer utilizing
              superconducting coils will be  constructed for use in the GO experiment at the
              CEBAF facility in  Newport News, VA.  The asymmetry in the scattering of
              polarized  electrons from a liquid hydrogen target will be measured.  Research
              in this area will advance our understanding of nucleon  in terms of constituent
              quarks and sea-quarks (quark-antiquary  pairs surrounding the constituent
              quarks).  This topic is among  the most exciting in nuclear and particle
              physics.  Base support  for the personnel who will work on this construction
              project  comes through a separate award to the University of Illinois  Nuclear
              Physics Laboratory.  Education of graduate students is  thus integral to this
              grant and to the overall research program  which will be carried out.  ***
