Abstract    :
              9410625  MASKUS  Differences in patent laws across countries have been a major
              issue  in the multilateral GATT negotiations in the Uruguay Round, in the 
              negotiation of the North American Free Trade Area, and in U.S.  efforts to
              discipline foreign unfair trade practices.  It is argued  that weak patent laws
              in developing countries tend to distort  international trade and investment
              flows by inducing innovative  firms to withdraw from servicing markets with
              limited protection.   There is, however, virtually no reliable information
              about whether  varying international patent laws tend to expand or restrict
              trade.   Theoretical models suggest that either of two conflicting outcomes 
              are possible.  On the one hand, because stronger patents provide  additional
              market power to firms, the firms may choose to engage in  greater exercise of
              that market power through export limitations  and price discrimination.  On the
              other hand, stronger patent laws  tend to expand the available market size for
              innovative firms.  It  is important to determine how domestic regulations of
              this sort, as  opposed to standard trade barriers, influence international
              trade.    This project will specify a series of theoretical models that allow 
              for various market structures and changes in trading behavior  induced by
              marginal shifts in patent laws.  In addition,  econometric models will be used
              to test empirically the hypotheses  generated by the theoretical models.    ***
