Abstract    :
              9410459  Lobo  The increased need for realism in fluid modeling in computer 
              graphics calls for physically-based techniques.  In addition,  these techniques
              cannot be as resource-demanding as those on  computational fluid dynamics. 
              This proposal concerns the  development of an approach that promises real-time
              performance  while providing physical authenticity in modeling the 3D 
              behaviors of the surface of fluids.  THe approach is based on  solving the full
              2D incompressible, viscous, Navier-Stokes  equations using a staggered
              marker-and-cell, to yield the  pressure and 2D velocity throughout the modeled
              2D finite  difference grid.  Then, the computed pressures are used to raise 
              the surface of fluid, thus providing the 3D effects and behaviors  pf fluid
              flow, without the exorbiant expense of full 3D  computation.  As our initial
              results show, this approach is  capable of achieving realistic real-time fluid
              simulation on a  commonly available workstation such as a Silicon Graphics
              Indigo.  Based on our promising intital results, research is proposed to 
              develop this appproach further.  To make this approach more  useful, we are
              proposing to improve its flexibility, its  stability, and its capabilities.  We
              are also proposing to use  the approach in developing algorithms that model
              blending of  different fluids, fluids, that slosh in moving containers, and 
              modeling liquid metals.    ***
