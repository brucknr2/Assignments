Abstract    :
              9410646  Chen       This project investigates a challenging problem in nonlinear
               control.  It aims to provide a systematic synthesis procedure for  designing
              output tracking controllers that apply to nonminimum  phase nonlinear systems. 
              Not only does the controller provide  stable asymptotic tracking, it also
              ensures that the transient  error will be within a prespecified bound.  This
              achieved by  using a novel approach of stable inversion.  In this approach, 
              the nonminimum phase system is first stably inverted to obtain  desired (and
              stable) state and input trajectories that map  exactly into the reference
              trajectory.  With this, the nonminimum  phase control problem is converted into
              a minimum phase one.   Then a feedback controller is designed to stabilize the
              closed-  loop system and to ensure robustness to certain types of 
              uncertainties.  This research is expected to make significant  contributions to
              the tracking problem as well as the basic  understanding of nonlinear systems. 
              The new procedures developed  can be applied to many engineering problems, such
              as aircraft   control, rocket control, medical equipment, nondestructive 
              evaluation, leading to superior performance and economic  benefits.  ***
