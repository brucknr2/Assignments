Abstract    :
              9410771  Delfyett  Work will be performed on the generation, characterization,
              and  utilization of high power ultrashort optical pulses from  semiconductor
              traveling wave optical amplifiers.  Funding for this  effort is required to
              initiate and establish a high speed photonics  effort at the Center for
              Research and Education for Optics and  Lasers.  The salient feature in this
              research proposal is to  exploit the large gain and bandwidth, which can be
              bandgap  engineered into semiconductor optical amplifiers in order to  support
              the generation of ultrashort, high power optical pulses  from a compact
              efficient semiconductor laser source.  In addition,  novel uses of this source
              will be developed for applications in all  optical photonic networks, real time
              nonlinear optical signal  processing, and real time optical recording and
              retrieval in three  dimensional, volume or multilayer-multiwavelength optical
              memories.  ***
