Abstract    :
              9410385  Throne  The research proposed in this application is concerned with a 
              recently developed generalized eigensystem finite element  technique for the
              inverse problem of electrocardiography will be  extended, compared with other
              existing methods and validated by  comparison with experimental results. 
              Preliminary results  indicate that the new generalized eigensystem method
              performs  better than existing approaches on a previously reported  eccentric
              spheres model problem with anterior and posterior  spherical cap sources.  This
              generalized eigensystem technique  will first be applied to the inhomogeneous
              eccentric spheres  problem and then to a realistic human torso model with
              realistic  human epicardial potentials.  With both models the effects of 
              errors in estimating the conductivities, errors in the  anisotropic properties,
              and geometrical errors will be examined  and compared with previously reported
              methods.  In addition, the  techniques will be validated and compared with
              experimental  results from an isolated rabbit heart preparation.  Computational
               issues such as improved spectral finite elements, robustness,  accuracy, and
              efficiency will be considered.  ***
