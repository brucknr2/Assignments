Abstract    :
              9410015  Santos  This work will establish a research program whose objectives
              are to explore the materials science of InSb/AlxIn1-xSb heteroepitaxy, to study
              the electrical properties of InSb quantum wells, and to develop novel electron
              devices which exploit their unique attributes.  Molecular beam epitaxy will be
              used to deposit InSb and AlxIn1-xSb epitaxial layers on GaAs and InSb quantum
              wells.  Since InSb has the highest intrinsic electron mobility of all binary
              III-V compounds, InSb quantum wells have potential used in both magnetic field
              sensor and transistor applications.  The use of AlxIn1-xSb is expected to be a
              critical step in fulfilling this potential by serving as a suitable barrier
              material.  ***
