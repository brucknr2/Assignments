Abstract    :
              This research is on finding pipeline schedulers for the behavioral  description
              of an iterative or recursive algorithm or loops.  This  extends the scheduling
              algorithm to more realistic resource models  and to graphs with conditionals. 
              The goal is to expose the  parallelism in an iterative or recursive algorithm
              to provide  information for optimization.  Focus is on the innermost loops or 
              iterations, which are the most time-critical for applications.  The  approach
              is to study the structure of cyclic data-flow graphs with  edge delays in order
              to optimize behavioral transformation,  scheduling and partitioning.
