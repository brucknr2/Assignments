Abstract    :
              This project analyzes communication in a class of games called  sender-receiver
              games.  In such a game, a privately informed  sender sends a message to a
              receiver who then acts in response to  the message.  The sender and receiver
              obtain payoffs that depend  on the private information of the sender and the
              receiver's  action, and not on the message sent.  Sender-receiver games are 
              widely used to study communication issues in accounting, finance,  economics
              and political science where the incentives of the  sender and receiver are
              either perfectly or often partially  aligned.  These games comprise a rich
              class of games extensively  outlined in theory because of their importance for
              understanding  communication in strategic situations.  This project will derive
               a set of hypotheses concerning the outcomes of these evolutionary  games and
              experimental methods will be employed to assess the  performance of these
              hypotheses.
