Abstract    :
               This project explores techniques for automatic storage  reclamation, especially
              for real-time and distributed systems. It compares  techniques for incremental
              garbage collection in  terms of efficiency, real-time  guarantees, and
              performance for  distributed data. The focus is on  techniques that support 
              high-performance on standard hardware, and standard  compiler  optimizations.  
               The three major phases of the project are; (1)  implementation and  evaluation
              of a new real-time uniprocessor garbage  collection  algorithm which provides
              better real-time guarantees than  incremental copying due to weaker coupling
              between the  application and the  garbage collector, (2) extensions of the 
              algorithm for near real-time systems  where some real-time  guarantees can be
              sacrificed for higher performance, and  (3)  application of these incremental
              techniques as local garbage  collectors in  a distributed garbage collection
              system, where they  will enable higher  performance garbage collection of
              poorly  distributed data.
