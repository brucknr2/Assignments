Abstract    :
              9410905  Lo  When communication and computing systems merge in the coming
              information age, schemes of interfacing photonics and electronics become
              increasingly important.  One ideal scenario will be integrating photonics and
              electronics together to form optoelectronic integrated circuits (OEIC's).  Such
              OEIC's will not only provide efficient O/E and E/O interfaces but also have
              applications in massively parallel interconnect and signal processing.  Since
              transistors and optical devices (laser and detectors), the workhorses for
              electronics and photonics, are mostly made of silicon and III-V compound
              semi-conductors respectively, the most sensible OEIC's should combine III-V
              optoelectronics with Si electronics.  If the technology for such III-V/Si
              OEIC's becomes available, exciting new areas such as the integration of
              optoelectronics with nanoelectronics and micromachining can be explored.  The
              future impact of these new areas might be very significant.    One fundamental
              problem for Si-based OEIC's is that high quality III-V compound epitaxy can not
              be formed reliably on Si substrates. Besides, the integration process of
              forming III-V/Si OEIC's has not been developed, hindered by the process
              incompatibilities between III-V and Si materials.  To solve these technical
              bottlenecks, this research will focus on three subjects:  (1) to develop viable
              technology to integrate III-V epitaxial layers on silicon substrates, (2) to
              develop processes to integrate III-V optical components with silicon electronic
              circuits, and (3) to demonstrate functional III-V/Si OEIC's.  ***
