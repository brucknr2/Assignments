Abstract    :
              This research is on numerical methods for digital logic synthesis  based on
              spectral information of the logic description.  The  approach is to use the BDD
              description of the circuits to develop  efficient methods for computing the
              spectral coefficients.  Because  of the numerical nature of the algorithms,
              design optimizations can  be included in the synthesis process, rather than
              later.   Theoretical results are being derived and used to implement a new 
              class of synthesis algorithms that are suitable for incorporation  into
              existing design environments.  The algorithms are being tested  on industry
              benchmarks.
