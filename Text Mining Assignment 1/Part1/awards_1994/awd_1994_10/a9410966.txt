Abstract    :
              9410966  Hairston   In this proposal the PI's will address the role of dormant
              propagules in long-term population and community dynamics of two Daphnia
              species in Oneida Lake, New York. Although both species have persisted in the
              system for at least 30 years, their water-column densities are negatively
              correlated. One species is typically abundance while the other remains in low
              numbers. This transient dominance lasts for months or years, and has been
              attributed to a combination of competition and predation. This recurring
              pattern raises two questions: (1) how is each species able to persist over the
              long-term, and (2) if there is competition, why are both species present in the
              system?   Both species produce diapausing eggs which remain viable in the lake
              sediments for a potentially long time period. By using theoretical models first
              proposed by Chesson and Warner (1981), the investigators will examine the
              hypothesis that the reproductive potential stored in these dormant eggs not
              only allows each species to persist in this system, but also enables long-term
              coexistence of two potentially competing species. To do this, the investigators
              will first consider the egg bank dynamics of each species independently. They
              will then test the hypothesis that the negative correlation between these two
              species is the result of competition.. Lastly, they will examine the role of
              the dormant eggs on the long-term interactions of the two species.  %%%  This
              dissertation research project will provide the first detailed investigation of
              an alternative mechanism for the coexistence of competing species in aquatic
              systems. Most studies focus on competition or predation, but the storage of
              propagules is a much neglected phenomenon which may be an important key to
              understanding factors that maintain biodiversity in aquatic and terrestrial
              systems.
