Abstract    :
              This Career Advancement Award for Women in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and
              Organometallic  Chemistry Program will enable Colleen Partigianoni of Ithaca
              College to conduct pilot studies  on multielectron activation of metal
              compounds with Dr. Thomas J. Meyer at the University of  North Carolina at
              Chapel Hill.  The research will involve the synthesis of novel bimetallic 
              complexes of osmium(II) or ruthenium(II) and copper(II) or cobalt(II). 
              Transient absorption  spectroscopy will be used to investigate the kinetics of
              the photoinduced charge-separated  species.  By altering the ligand
              environment, the properties of the excited state species will be  controlled. 
              The goal of the work is to photochemically generate cobalt(I) centers which can
               serve as effective sources of two electrons.  The results are relevant to
              solar energy conversion.   Also, this research experience will enable
              Partigianoni to establish a new area for undergraduate  research at Ithaca
              College.
