Abstract    :
              9410701  Chung    In spite of  the many interesting properties of 
              intermetallics that make them attractive as high temperature  materials, they
              share one common disadvantage:  brittle  behavior in room temperature air. 
              There have been numerous  studies in the last ten years to explore different
              ways to  ductilize this class of materials.  Recent studies suggest  that
              intermetallic alloys  such as Nickel-Aluminide (Ni3Al)   are intrinsically
              ductile, and their brittleness is a result  of hydrogen embrittlement (the
              hydrogen produced by  reactions between water vapor in air and fresh
              intermetallic  surfaces exposed during deformation).  However, other 
              intermetallics  such as Nickel-Iron  (Ni3Fe)  do not appear  to exhibit any
              moisture-induced embrittlement.  It is  hypothesized that if the water
              dissociation reaction to  produce hydrogen is quenched in some way by the
              presence of  oxygen, there will be no hydrogen embrittlement, and the  material
              will show improved ductility.  To test this  hypothesis, detailed surface
              science investigations of the  interactions between water vapor and clean
              surfaces of  intermetallic alloys, with and without the presence of  oxygen,
              are planned.  Using single crystals of the  intermetallic alloy
              nickel-aluminum-titanium,  Ni3(Al,Ti),  the room temperature sticking
              probability of water vapor on  various crystal faces will be measured and
              compared with  oxygen.  Vibration spectroscopy and thermal desorption are  used
              to determine on which crystal face the adsorbed water  dissociates to form
              hydrogen and if such dissociation is  affected by co-adsorbed oxygen.  To
              understand why Ni3Fe  polycrystals do not suffer moisture-induced
              embrittlement,  similar studies are performed to determine if oxygen out 
              competes water vapor for available adsorption sites and if  co-adsorption of
              water vapor and oxygen results in the  formation of surface hydroxyls instead
              of hydrogen.  %%%  These studies provide the basic framework to understand and 
              possibly control moisture-induc ed embrittlement in this  important class of
              materials.  ***
