Abstract    :
              This research is on architectural-level simulation using field-  programmable
              gate arrays as hardware accelerators.  The goals of  this research include the
              development of a paradigm for  architectural specification that is both
              general-purpose and can be  used to produce fast and efficient simulators,
              development of a  graphical user interface-based entry tool, development of
              tools for  automatic translation of an architectural description to FPGA 
              programming information, and implementation of a trace-driven  execution
              environment to run the simulations.  The key idea behind  this work is to use
              FPGA's to simulate a system above the gate  level, at the level of events,
              dependencies, resources and delays.   FPGA's place a limit on the size of the
              hardware-implemented data  structures, which will be extended via a software
              monitor to allow  virtual, unlimited-length structures.  The simulation will be
               automatically translated from a high-level description by use of  methods
              adapted from high-level synthesis and the compilation of C  programs.  To aid
              in entering the architectural description, a  graphical user interface tool
              will be developed.  The paradigm for  system description will be based on a
              discrete-event architectural  model of system behavior.  This paradigm will be
              hierarchical and  provide a library that takes advantage of existing fast
              simulation  techniques for cache and processor simulation.
