Abstract    :
               9410141 Guo  The primary goal of this research planning activity is to identify
              polarization fluctuation characteristics in ferroelectric materials of the
              tungsten bronze (TB) structure.  Dielectric properties of TB crystals under
              designed poling conditions in a broad temperature and frequency range are to be
              tested to reveal the dependence of the speculated polarization fluctuation on
              the crystallographic parameters.  Selected single crystals of lead barium
              niobium oxide solid solutions, including crystals of near morphotropic phase
              boundary compositions, will be used to perform preliminary tests under various
              poling conditions.  The outcome of the planned activities is expected to offer
              guidelines (but not the answers) on (i) whether the specific dielectric
              dispersive behavior underlines polarization fluctuation; (ii) is this
              phenomenon characteristic to the TB family, i.e., inherent to its
              crystallographic structure? (iii) is the polarization fluctuation a thermally
              activated process? and (iv) what is the role of chemical composition
              fluctuation on the speculated polarization fluctuation?  %%% Ferroelectric
              materials of tungsten bronze structure encompass a large family of solid
              solution systems with great potential in optical and electrooptic applications;
              however, an understanding of their characteristic polarization properties is a
              key still lacking for further exploration of new materials and modification of
              known materials in this family.  This research, along with knowledge on
              ferroelectric oxygen octahedral materials (including the perovskites and the
              tungsten bronzes) in general, will give the foundation for researchto select,
              modify and design tungsten bronze ferroelectric materials with desired and
              controllable ferroelectric properties. ***
