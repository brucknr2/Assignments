Abstract    :
              This project consists of five areas of research.  The first  involves testing
              hypotheses with a restricted parameter space.   This research will focus on the
              development of new tests that  possess optimality properties and on the
              question of whether the  likelihood ratio test is asymptotically admissible. 
              The second  area involves testing hypotheses when a nuisance parameter is 
              present only under the alternative hypothesis.  This research  will also focus
              on developing new tests that have optimality  properties for testing for random
              parameter variation.  The third  area involves estimation of the intercept of a
              semiparametric  selection model.  The forth area involves the estimation of 
              nonlinear models with time trends.  Research in this area will  consider
              asymptotics for nonlinear estimators and models for data  that exhibit
              deterministic and stochastic trends.  The final area  of research will focus on
              testing when a nuisance parameter is  present only in parts of the null
              hypothesis.
