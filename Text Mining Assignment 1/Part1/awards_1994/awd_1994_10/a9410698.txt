Abstract    :
              9410698  Bringi         The objective of this research is the analysis and 
              interpretation of two (Florida) thunderstorms observed during CaPE 
              observations of radar reflectivity polarization, doppler winds,  microphysical
              structure (from aircraft) and surface electric field  will be used to obtain
              coherent representation of the initiation  and evolution of these
              thunder-storms.  These interpretations will  be guided by the use of a
              numerical cloud model to help resolve  some details of hydrometer growth,
              including likely options of  charge growth and separation.  ***
