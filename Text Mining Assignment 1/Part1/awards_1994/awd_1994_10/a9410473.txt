Abstract    :
              9410473  Hajjar  This is a Research Initiation Award to study the force 
              displacement response and ultimate strength behavior of  composite
              subassemblies of unbraced frames.  Structural  engineers are increasingly
              realizing the economic benefits  of using concrete filled steel tube (CFT)
              beam-columns in  low and medium-rise construction, and they expect the demand 
              for CFTs to grow significantly in the next decade.  Detailed  but efficient
              numerical simulation, coupled with  experimental research, is the only
              practical means of  understanding CFT behavior.  Yet only insufficient research
               has been conducted on CFTs to date.  The subassemblies to be  studied in this
              project consist of steel I girders framing  into rectangular CFT beam-columns
              subjected to either  monotonic or cyclic loading.  The project's objectives
              are:  1) to develop a practical, three-dimensional, nonlinear,  fiber-based
              finite element formulation to represent CFT beam  columns; 2) to develop
              compatible nonlinear models to  represent the girder-to-column connection and
              panel zone  region; 3) to implement these formulations in an existing 
              composite frame analysis system, and to calibrate the  formulations against
              experimental data; and 4) to conduct  comprehensive parametric studies of
              individual CFT beam-  columns and composite subassemblies.  The parametric
              studies  will be conducted to provide the data required to improve  the
              accuracy and scope of current non-seismic and seismic  design specification
              provisions. This fiber analysis will  also facilitate investigation of new
              composite CFT systems,  and permit experimentalists to both predict and
              interpret  their test results.  ***
