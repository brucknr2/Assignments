Abstract    :
              9410647  Russell, Bruce W.    This research will evaluate simple changes to
              shear reinforcement  details that are likely to ensure safety against
              shear/bond  failures; specifically, longitudinal mild shear reinforcement  will
              be placed within the end regions of a beam's web to prevent  propagation of the
              web shear cracks.  Compression field theory  will demonstrate that the
              longitudinal reinforcement completes a  "tuss" within a beam's web, increasing
              shear stiffness and  controlling propagation of web shear cracks.    Ten
              pretensioned I-shaped composite high strength girders will be  cast and tested
              under static and fatigue loading.  Variables will  include the amount of
              horizontal and vertical shear  reinforcement.  From these data, design criteria
              will be  established to provide practical guidelines for safe and  economical
              detailing of end reinforcements.  ***
