Abstract    :
              9410115  Silber       The investigator will develop equivariant bifurcation
              theory  for applications to symmetry-breaking bifurcations in  hydrodynamic
              systems and in globally coupled oscillator arrays.  The first part of the
              research focuses on translation symmetry  breaking in hydrodynamic systems that
              are extended in more than  one space dimension. Both the situation where
              translation  symmetry is broken spontaneously by an attracting solution of the 
              governing equations, and the situation where it is broken  externally by
              perturbing the equations will be considered. In the  former case, the
              manifestations of the underlying translation  symmetry in the possible
              evolution of instabilities of the  symmetry-broken state will be investigated.
              In the case of  external symmetry breaking, the research focuses on the
              specific  physical system of rotating Rayleigh-Benard convection; this is a 
              system for which it has already been established that breaking  translation
              symmetry can have a profound effect on certain  instabilities. The second part
              of the research project consists  of a group theoretic/dynamical systems
              analysis of the  $S_n$-equivariant Hopf bifurcation problem. This bifurcation 
              problem is pertinent to the dynamics of n globally-coupled  identical limit
              cycle oscillators. This research is motivated by  recent analytic and numerical
              studies of series arrays of  Josephson junctions. Global coupling represents an
              important  limiting case for the coupling of oscillators; this aspect of the 
              research project should contribute to our understanding of  oscillator arrays
              ubiquitous in the modeling of physical,  chemical, and biological systems.  ***
