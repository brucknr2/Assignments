Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the  
              Chemistry Division, Prof. Stwalley will study the electronic spectroscopy   of
              diatomic alkali molecules in "long range states" in which internuclear  
              distances are larger than about 10 Angstroms.  Knowledge of the energy   levels
              in this region gives information about the long-range potential   energy
              curves, which is important for understanding photodissociation and  
              associative ionization processes.  Optical-optical double resonance   (OODR)
              and All-Optical Triple Resonance (AOTR) will be used to study the  
              spectroscopy and dynamics of these processes state selectively.    In the
              experiments being conducted in this project, lasers are used to   determine
              various properties of diatomic molecules as well as to study   light-induced
              processes in these two-atom molecules.  Among the   information to be gathered
              are data regarding photodissociation   (bond-breaking induced by light) and
              associative ionization (bond-forming   with attendant loss of an electron). 
              Fundamental information such as   this has impact on our understanding of a
              variety of areas, including   atmospheric processes and materials processing
              using lasers or plasmas.
