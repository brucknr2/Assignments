Abstract    :
                    ABSTRACT  CTS-9321887  William Marsh Rice University  P. I.:  Riki
              Kobayashi        A new five-parameter extended corresponding states model has
              been developed for viscosity and proton spin-lattice relaxation rate applicable
              to a variety of hydrocarbons in the dense fluid phase.  Simple mixing rules
              allows extension of the model to mixtures.    This proposed model is shown to
              bring improvements over the viscosity model of Ely and Hanley  1, 2 , for
              cyclic and branched alkanes, and their mixtures with n-paraffins.  The
              corresponding states treatment of the proton spin-lattice relaxation rate, R1,
              yields a new correlation between R1 and temperature for saturated hydrocarbons,
              spanning three different processes of spin relaxation (i.e.  spin-rotation,
              intramolecular and intermolecular dipole-dipole mechanisms).  Accurate
              correlations between  {SYMBOL 104 \f "Symbol"} are generated for pure and mixed
              fluids, with observed root-mean-square deviations of less than 8.0%.    This
              new approach utilizes shape factors  3  to properly predict p-v-t surfaces; and
              two additional constants to account for transport.  The new parameters, {SYMBOL
              103 \f "Symbol"} for viscosity, and {SYMBOL 98 \f "Symbol"} for R1, mainly
              arise from hindered rotation of polyatomic molecules.    The four-parameter
              corresponding states treatment, utilizing only the shape factors  3 , yields
              correlations of comparable accuracy, when confined to long-chain alkanes.
