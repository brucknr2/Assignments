Abstract    :
              9410102   Savelsbergh       This research is focused on the development of an
              environment  for the implementation of parallel linear programming based
              branch-  and-bound algorithms for mixed integer programs.  Within this 
              environment, special attention is given to branch-and-cut and  branch-and-price
              algorithms. Branch-and-cut and branch-and-price  are variants of linear
              programming based branch-and-bound  algorithms.  Topics covered in the research
              include reformulation,  decomposition, row and column generation, row and
              column  management, branching, parallel architecture, fine and coarse grain 
              parallelism, task allocation, communication, and synchronization.   Modular
              experimental codes will be developed to test and evaluate  the methodologies
              developed in the research.       The development of an environment for
              implementing parallel  linear program based branch-and-bound algorithm for
              mixed integer  programming will result in a better understanding of the 
              applicability of parallel computing for mathematical programming.   The
              research outcome will also open up opportunities for the  implementation of
              special purpose algorithms for certain classes of  problems in logistics and
              manufacturing.
