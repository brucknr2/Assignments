Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9410081  Colorado School of Mines  P.I.:  John R. Dorgan      An
              initiative in the computer simulation of polymeric materials is pursued.  Monte
              Carlo (MC) simulation of copolymer chains at inorganic interfaces is developed
              as a basis for the rational design of surface active polymeric agents.  The
              specific MC technique used is the cooperative-motion algorithm of Pakula;
              significant advantages over other simulation methods are demonstrated.  The
              simulations provide detailed structural information (chain conformations,
              absorbed amounts, chain segment profiles, etc.) about the absorbed copolymer
              layer under equilibrium conditions.  This structural information can be
              calculated based on the strength of the copolymer segment/substrate
              interaction, the specific block sequencing of the copolymer, solvent quality,
              and surface heterogeneity.  Comparison of simulation results with well defined
              experimental data allows the determination of model parameters.  Upon
              verification, the MC algorithm may be used for predictive purposes allowing the
              apriori design of copolymer layers for specific purposes.
