Abstract    :
                  This research applies the technique of competitive  analysis,  originally
              developed to study on-line algorithms, to the design  of  algorithms for
              distributed systems with unpredictable  failures.  Competitive  analysis
              compares the performance of an  algorithm with that of an optimal  ``off-line''
              algorithm designer  in effect to predict the future.  Using it, an  algorithm
              designer  can avoid the perils of designing for the worst case  (yielding 
              algorithms too inefficient under milder conditions to be  practical)  or for a
              normal case that may turn out to have little  correspondence with  reality.   
              (1) The first task of the project is to formulate performance  measures for
              distributed algorithms that are amenable to  competitive analysis  (the
              surprising difficulty of this task may  explain why previous applications  of
              competitive analysis to  distributed problems have largely concentrated on  the
              on-line  aspects of those problems).   (2) The second is to construct 
              distributed algorithms that perform well by the competitive  measures.  By 
              implementing these algorithms it is possible  to test that the measures do  in
              fact predict good real-world  performance.  This work  will yield both 
              insights into the theory of distributed algorithms and better  practical
              algorithms for the distributed system builder.
