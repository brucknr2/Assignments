Abstract    :
              9410386  Zhou       Sequential Function Chart (SFC) and Petri net based 
              methodologies are addressed in this project.  The first objective  of this
              project is to perform a benchmark study for Ladder Logic  Diagrams (LLDs),
              SFCs, and Petri nets in terms of their design  efficiency, cost, adaptability,
              and maintainability on a flexible  manufacturing system.  The second objective
              is to perform design  recovery from LLDs  to SFCs and Petri nets.           The
              research results will advance the knowledge, tools, and  methodologies for
              designing and optimizing discrete-event  controllers in large industrial
              automation projects.  Current  industrial automated manufacturing systems work
              with a number of  inputs and outputs varying from perhaps ten to several
              thousands  and have communication capacity.  Traditional discrete-event 
              control design approaches such as LLDs prove entirely ineffective  on
              large-scale problems.
