Abstract    :
              Weaver  9410032  This project is concerned with making massively parallel
              computers more usable by scientists and engineers working with irregular
              applications.  Irregular applications are those whose underlying data
              structures are not simple static dense arrays, but are more complicated either
              because the relationships between the underlying data elements are not modeled
              well by arrays or because the amount and shape of the data change significantly
              during the course of the computation.  There is little support of any kind
              available for the programmer who wants to put one of these applications on a
              massively parallel machine.  The project will take a language, DYNO, that has
              been designed for programming irregular applications and testes with a number
              of small kernels and subject it to intense analysis using significantly sized,
              real irregular applications.
