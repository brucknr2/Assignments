Abstract    :
              9410093  DeMeter       The award is for research to develop better understanding
              of  workpiece deflections due to clamping forces resulting from part  fixturing
              systems during machining operations and the resulting  part geometric errors. 
              Such improved understanding will help  design fixturing systems which minimize
              part geometric error in the  presence of cutting forces.  The concept of
              approximate models or  meta-models is used to simplify the problem solution.   
                 The results of the research would benefit machining fixture  design
              practices and would be applicable to a broader class of  contact problems in
              mechanics characterized by variable boundary  conditions.  Currently, the area
              of machining fixture design is not  being addressed adequately by research
              despite its acknowledged  importance.
