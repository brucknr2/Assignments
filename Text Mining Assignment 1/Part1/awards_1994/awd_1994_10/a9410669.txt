Abstract    :
              9410669  Clough  This Career Advancement Grant Award was designed to develop 
              additional collaboration with other researchers in the  field, as well extend
              the principal investigator's current  knowledge of functional imaging and
              biomathematical modeling  techniques.  To effect this, a research-oriented
              sabbatical  leave to the Center for Bioengineering's National Simulation 
              Resource for Circulatory Mass Transport and Exchange at the  University of
              Washington is funded.  The laboratory has  expertise in modeling and simulation
              of biological transport  processes, multiple indicator dilution techniques,
              metabolic  transformation processes and functional imaging.  ***
