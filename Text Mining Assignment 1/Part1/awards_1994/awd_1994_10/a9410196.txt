Abstract    :
              9410196  Koelling    The objective of this research is to develop a fundamental
              understanding of a newly developed injection molding process known as
              gas-assisted injection molding.  The prototype problem consists of the motion
              of a long gas bubble through a tube filled with a viscoelastic liquid.  Since
              many fluids used in industrial processes are viscoelastic, the principal focus
              will be on the effect of rheology on the bubble penetration and fluid motion
              near the bubble front.  This work is experimental in nature and uses advanced
              fluid mechanical and rheological techniques.  A video imaging system will be
              used to provide information about the entire flow field and the fraction of
              liquid deposited in the tube wall will be measured.  ***
