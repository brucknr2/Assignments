Abstract    :
              9410839  Finn  This award supports a workshop entitled  Geodynamic Evolution of
              the  Transantarctic Mountains and the West Antarctic Rift: A Linked System.  
              The  West Antarctic Rift system is a major continental rift adjacent to the
              East  Antarctic craton and the Transantarctic Mountains are thought to
              represent an  uplifted rift shoulder on the south side of the rift system.  The
              rift system is of  particular interest because of the marine-based West
              Antarctic Ice Sheet that  occupies the region.  The late Mesozoic and Cenozoic
              tectonic evolution of the  rift and mountains have been the subject of several
              recent investigations  sponsored by several national Antarctic programs.  These
              investigations have  demonstrated that these features are clearly linked and
              that their evolution has  been complex.  The proposed workshop will allow
              investigators to discuss  approaches to future research to understand the
              dynamics of this rift system  and the adjacent Transantarctic Mountains and to
              begin discussions about  collaborative research to focus on this region.  ***
