Abstract    :
              Project Summary  Samson/ATM-9410716         The purpose of this research is to
              investigate the interaction  of solar radiation with a planetary atmosphere and
              to provide  absolute cross sections for each of the specific interaction 
              processes as a function of wavelength.  The results of solar  radiation
              incident upon a planet's atmosphere depend critically on  the wavelength of
              solar radiation:  while Rayleigh scattering of  the visible light causes a blue
              sky, more energetic radiation can  cause dissociation, ionization, and
              dissociative ionization of the  atmospheric molecules.  Modified components of
              a planetary  atmosphere may react with the ambient species to form a new source
               of molecules in the atmosphere, while the results of ionization  produce the
              atmosphere.
