              SUMMARY    Proposal Number:  CTS-9410251  P.I.:  Sevick  Institution:  Colorado 
                 The author proposes to simulate the adsorption of surfactant molecules onto
              clay platelets.  Monte Carlo simulations will be utilized to provide a
              description of the equilibrium structure of surfactant microphases adsorbed to
              isolated clay platelets as well as surfactants which are sandwiched between
              platelets.  Experiments will attempt to identify fingerprints of the structures
              generated by simulation and hopefully lead to a better description of the
              surfactant microphase structure.   The review panel was unanimously
              enthusiastic about the research project.  This would be an opportunity to "make
              a name" for the PI.  However, the panel also consistently indicated that the
              problem is complex and needs to be attacked on a more "simple " basis.  First,
              a well-characterized solid surface should be used to simulate (MC)
              hemimcelles/admicelles.  Second, the comparison of MD (or MC) data to
              experiments will not be straight forward especially with respect to surface
              heterogeneities.  More thought should be directed towards relating macroscopic
              experimental measurements to microscopic MD (or MC) data.  Finally, check
              literature on micelle (in H2O) simulations and incorporate that knowledge into
              your simulation strategies.
