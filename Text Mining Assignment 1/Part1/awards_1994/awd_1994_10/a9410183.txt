Abstract    :
              9410183  Olejniczak  This project investigates new frequency-domain analysis
              methods  for electric power quality assessment.  The Hartley transform is 
              studied as an alternative methodology for the periodic steady-  state solution
              of electric power systems modelled by their  sinusoidal steady-state
              equivalents.  Since the fast Hartley  transform (FHT) is the most
              computationally-efficient frequency-  domain algorithm for performing linear or
              time-domain  convolution, the power system response to nonsinusoidal 
              excitations may be calculated efficiently and accurately.  It is  expected that
              the results of this research may lead to new real-  valued component models and
              structured matrices which may be  amenable to sparsity and parallel-processing
              techniques.  ***
