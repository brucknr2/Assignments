Abstract    :
              9410532  POLLARD                                 ABSTRACT    The principal goal
              of this project is to advance syntactic research  within the framework of
              head-driven phase structure grammar (HPSG),  with special attention to issues
              of LINEARIZATION (linear order,  or temporal succession, of elements in
              linguistic expressions). The  proposed research encompasses both empirical
              investigations and formal  issues connected with theoretical foundations and
              computational  verification.        The formal issues to be addressed focus on
              order  domains, which are hypothesized as attributes that represent the  linear
              order of linguistic expressions distinct from their  hierarchical phrase
              structure. In particular, an order domain may  contain elements that are not
              sisters in the hierarchical structure.  The aim is to develop a precise
              synthesis of order domains and  existing HPSG theory, formalized to a
              sufficient degree that it can be  computationally implemented and tested.  ***
