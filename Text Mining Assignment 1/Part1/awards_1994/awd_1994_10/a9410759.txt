Abstract    :
                   The few data that exist on exchange of atmospheric methane with tropical
              soils are equivocal.   Upland temperate soils are thought to be sinks of CH4,
              and site disturbance usually decreases rates  of CH4 uptake by soils, but these
              generalizations have not been tested widely in the tropics.  Indeed, 
              preliminary evidence suggests that high rates of soil respiration and low gas
              diffusivities in fine textured  soils of the eastern Amazon can result in CH4
              production in tropical forest soils.  Moreover, knowledge  of the effects of
              changing land uses on CH4 fluxes in the tropics is rudimentary at best.  The
              first  objective of this research is to assess variation in CH4 fluxes caused
              by land uses, diurnal cycles,  seasonal cycles, within-site heterogeneity, and
              events in primary forests, secondary forests, active  pastures of varying age,
              and abandoned pastures in eastern Amazon.  The second objective is to test  two
              mechanistic hypotheses:  that gas diffusivity in soils controls CH4 fluxes; and
              that enhanced NH4+  availability can inhibit CH4 consumption.  It is expected
              that diffusivity, estimated from profiles of 222Rn  and from CClF3 tracer
              experiments, will be the dominant factor affecting production and consumption 
              of CH4.  Characterizing the effects of land use in this area of active logging
              and ranching, and  describing these effects mechanistically will improve our
              understanding of how human activities impact  atmospheric methane.
