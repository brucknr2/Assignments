Abstract    :
              9410613  Chang       This research is focused on the development and use of a
              fuzzy  controller to address the problem of process design and control in  a
              short run production environment.  The controller will provide  recommendations
              on the choice of machine operating parameter in a  given production instance in
              order to produce a part of acceptable  quality.  Computer simulation will be
              used to test the controller  in the initial phase of the research. 
              Subsequently, data generated  from other currently existing models for process
              control purposes  will be used to test and fine-tune the performance of the 
              controller.  Upon the successful development of the controller,  sample parts
              will be designed and processed on computer numerical  control (CNC) machine to
              simulate a short run production  environment to further test the controller.  A
              second objective is  to develop a process monitoring approach that uses neural
              network  control chart (NNCC) to integrate observations from quality 
              characteristic and process related information to determine process  status.   
                 The outcome of the research has some potential for industrial  application
              to improve process quality and process parameter  selection for short-run
              production situation.  The integration of  process control and process design
              provides opportunity for on-line  process monitoring for process data
              collection with the objective  of improving product quality through reduction
              in process  operational variation.
