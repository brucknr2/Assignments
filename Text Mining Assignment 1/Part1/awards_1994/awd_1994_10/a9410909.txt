Abstract    :
                9410909  Leer                                   ABSTRACT         The objective
              of this research project is to produce a relational  database documenting the
              genetic relationship of Tlingit, Eyak, and  Athabaskan, plus explanatory prose.
               The main tables within the  database will include (a) a combined morpheme list
              for the  (proto-)  languages compared, (b) citations for Proto-Athabaskan
              reconstructions  and other comparisons in the published and unpublished
              literature, (c)  the cognate sets themselves, (d) sets of conceivably
              interrelated  cognate sets, and (e) tables of regular sound correspondences. 
              The  database and prose explanation will be disseminated in the form of  sets
              of diskettes that are compatible with either MacIntosh or DOS-  based
              computers.
