Abstract    :
              9410851  Grossman    Description:  This project is to support  participation of
              twelve U.S. scientists in a  regional symposium and workshop on applications 
              of molecular biological research in  agriculture, health, and the environment,
              to be  held in Lahore, Pakistan, in March 1995.  The  symposium-workshop will
              be preceded by a two  week training course for sixteen young  researchers in
              relevant molecular biological  techniques, and other methodologies and 
              concepts.  This will help them participate in  the discussions of the symposium
              workshop  sessions.  The basic science sessions will  include: recombination
              and restriction  modification, molecular basis of genetic  transformation in
              bacteria, repair of UV  irradiated DNA in procaryotes, characterization  of UV
              repair genes in M. Luteus.  Applications  sessions will include: plant
              molecular biology  (crop improvement strategies, transformation of  certain
              crops, control of plant insects losses)  and human genome, and challenges of 
              therapeutics and diagnostics.     Scope:  This project involves some of the
              most  well known leaders in molecular biology in the  U.S. and Europe in an
              undertaking to enhance  this very important field in one of the world's  most
              heavily populated regions. Participants  will include some hundred scientists
              from  Pakistan, and from neighboring countries.  The  initial two week
              training, followed by the one  week symposium workshop provide for the 
              exchange of information, based on solid  foundation of understanding of the
              subject  matter.  Past meetings have led to research  collaboration between the
              U.S. and foreign  participants.  The topics of this meeting are  quite relevant
              to the needs and to the  capabilities of the participating south Asian 
              countries, and are also important to the United  States.  The project fits well
              with the INT  objectives.  ***
