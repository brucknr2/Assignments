Abstract    :
              9410943 R. O'Handley   This research involves a series of measurements directed
              toward a more thorough and fundamental understanding of giant surface
              magnetostriction.  Effective magnetoelastic coefficients can take on
              anomalously large values near the surface of magnetic thin films.  The
              thickness dependence of the principal magnetoelastic coefficients is examined
              in epitaxial single crystal nickel/copper, nickel/silver, cobalt/copper,
              iron/silver, and iron/tungsten thin films.  A fundamental understanding of
              surface magnetoelasticity is sought, particularly concerning its correct
              magnitude, symmetry, temperature dependence, and the physical significance of
              the Neel coefficients.  First principle calculations for the surface
              magnetoelastic coefficients of materials will be compared to experimental
              values measured in this program.  This work should provide a sound fundamental
              basis for creating a predictive capability with respect to the effects of
              different interface materials on surface magnetoelastic effects.  An exchange
              interaction model for the extended range of the highly localized surface effect
              will be tested by comparing the range of the surface magnetoelastic anomaly for
              different metals at different temperatures. %%% These observations have
              important technical consequences, since it appears that the surface conditions
              of thin film magnetic devices are of enhanced importance in controlling
              magnetic properties, especially anisotropy, permeability, and noise, even in
              compositions of nominally zero magnetostriction. ***
