Abstract    :
              9410869  Stone    The popular movement and candidacy of H. Ross Perot added an 
              historic dimension to the 1992 presidential election. By winning  19 percent of
              the popular vote, Mr. Perot outdistanced all  independent candidates in the
              20th century except Theodore  Roosevelt, who ran as a popular ex-president in
              1912.  Perot;s  success in mobilizing thousands of activists and attracting 
              millions of votes raised questions about the health of the  American two-party
              system, and whether he would be able to  transform his movement into an
              enduring third party.    The most important and enduring legacy of the Perot
              movement will  likely be manifest through the cadre of activists mobilized by 
              his campaign.  The Perot movement will change the parties whether  Mr. Perot
              runs again for president in 1996, and whether he is  able to convert his
              movement into a third party.  The purpose of  this investigation is to monitor
              active participants in the 1992  Perot campaign as they encounter the 1994
              congressional elections  and the 1996 presidential election.  By studying
              changes in their  attitudes, perceptions, and behavior, and by comparing them
              with  samples of activists in the two major parties, the investigators  will be
              able to track the Perot movement and its impact on the  two party system.
