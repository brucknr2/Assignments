Abstract    :
              In this research project, supported by a Career Advancement Award for   Women
              Scientists, high-level, ab initio, molecular electronic structure  
              calculations will be carried out for clusters consisting of one or more   metal
              atoms, particularly Hafnium, inside or outside a cage of 28 carbon   atoms. 
              The calculations will be carried out with relativistic core   potentials,
              spin-orbit operators, large orbital basis sets, and a   configuration
              interaction wavefunction.   The COLUMBUS code will be used   taking maximum
              advantage of the high point group symmetry of the   molecular system.  The
              results will be analyzed to predict trends in   ionization potentials, electron
              affinity, and electronic spectra, and to   study the factors that affect
              chemical bonding in these fullerene-like   cluster compounds.    The recent
              discovery of Buckminsterfullerene, a remarkably stable   molecule consisting of
              60 carbon atoms forming a symmetric cage   resembling a soccer ball, has
              motivated experiments to find other   molecules with similar chemical bonding. 
              One of the smallest such carbon   cluster molecules, observed in plasmas,
              consists of 28 carbon atoms   bonded together, as in Buckminsterfullerene, in
              fused rings of five and   six atoms around a heavy metal atom.   A few of these
              28 carbon atom   complexes are selected for theoretical study using highly
              accurate   quantum mechanical theory to predict physical properties which will
              aid   the interpretation of experiments and provide a deeper understanding of  
              the chemical principles which govern the stabilities of such complexes
