Abstract    :
              9410428  Hubel  This Research Planning Grant was designed to aid in the 
              preparation of a proposal by the principal investigator to  facilitate
              preliminary studies in the application of  magnetic resonance imaging to
              measure the transport of water  and cryoprotective agent in a synthetic dermal
              replacement.  A preliminary assessment of the viability of using localized 
              nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy will also be  examined to determine the
              extent of osmotic damage during  the permeation and equilibration processes. 
              These studies  provide the foundation for subsequent experimental and 
              theoretical studies on transport issues in the dermal  replacement as well as
              other engineered tissues.  ***
