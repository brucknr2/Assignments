Abstract    :
              9410138  Halloran       This career advancement award provides support for
              research  in the areas of mathematical statistics and bio-statistics, 
              concentrating on the understanding and development of statistical  inference
              with particular applications to the analysis of  diseases.   Particular
              emphasis is on decision or inference, on testing or  estimation, the use of
              prior information, location and nature of  inference and sensitivity of
              sampling procedure.  Development of  skill involving statistical computing will
              play a major role in  this activity.  Methods such as bootstrap, exploration of
               posterior distributions and likelihood functions, Markov Chain  Monte Carlo
              algorithms will be explored.  Some of these studies  will take place at the
              University of Minnesota where methods and  applications of Bayes and empirical
              Bayesian methods of inference  are being developed.       Statistical methods
              in the analysis of causal inference,  especially in studies of spread of
              infectious diseases and  effectiveness of vaccines is an important and highly
              developed  component of the mathematical sciences.  This project will  continue
              this effort in the study of disease transmission and  designs for vaccine
              evaluation.  ***
