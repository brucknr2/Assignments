Abstract    :
              9410848  McPhee  This project is the analysis of the data set obtained as part
              of an  integrated research program into the oceanographic structure of the 
              western Weddell Sea.  The field work was carried out from an ice  camp jointly
              occupied by U.S. and Russian scientists from February  to June 1992.  The data
              set obtained by the principal investigator  had as its objective the definition
              of the vertical and horizontal  thermohaline fluxes within the western part of
              the Weddell Gyre.   Specifically, instrument clusters capable of measuring the
              Reynolds  stress and the turbulent heat flux directly were suspended from the 
              ice at the camp and maintained throughout the duration of the  drift.  Also, a
              remote buoy to measure upper ocean temperature,  salinity, and current
              structure was emplaced to make observations  on the larger scale variability
              within which the turbulence data is  embedded, and which is expected to have
              some effect on the  turbulence intensity.  The analysis program will be carried
              out in  conjunction with those of other concurrent experiments to quantify  the
              energy brought to the underside of the ice, working toward the  general goal of
              tracing the flux of energy from the ocean through  the sea ice cover to the
              atmosphere.  ***
