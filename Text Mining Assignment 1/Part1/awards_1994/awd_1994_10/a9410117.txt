Abstract    :
                9410117  Dalal       A general-purpose knowledge representation (KR) system
              allows  explicit representation of and reasoning with various kinds of 
              information.  A critical problem in present-day KR systems is  caused by the
              tradeoff between the expressiveness of the  representation language and the
              computational complexity of  reasoning with it -- deductive reasoning with
              sufficiently  expressive languages is inherently intractable.  In preliminary 
              work in addressing this problem, the PI has developed a technique  for
              generating tractable approximate reasoners, and a parameter,  called intricacy,
              whose finite value for a representation language  indicates that reasoning with
              it is tractable.  The preliminary  approach has some serious limitations. 
              First, although there are  many approximate reasoners that can be obtained
              using the technique  for any given application, the PI has not provided any
              systematic  way for among them.  Second, although he has shown that many known 
              tractable cases of reasoning have finite intricacy, he has not used  this
              parameter for obtaining new non-trivial tractability results.   The proposed
              research addresses these limitations.  The PI proposes  to evaluate various
              approximate reasoners by implementing and  testing them on KR systems used in
              some real-world applications;  this evaluation will be used to develop
              guidelines for choosing  appropriate reasoner for a given application.  The PI
              also proposes  to use intricacy for obtaining new non-trivial tractable cases
              that  are characterized by efficiently-identifiable syntactic features.
