Abstract    :
              9410060  Allen  The proposed research is in the Undergraduate Design Projects 
              Program category, and requests support for undergraduate and  graduate student
              engineers to provide prototype "custom designed"  devices and software to aid
              persons with disabilities.  The  primary goal of this thrust is to provide
              meaningful design  experience for the engineering student that will directly
              aid a  specific disabled individual. A formal program is in place at the 
              University of Delaware which will ensure satisfactory progress is  attained on
              these projects.  A group of students and the  investigators on the grant will
              work with a number of  collaborating agencies and individuals on these
              projects. Forty  projects are planned during the five year duration of this
              award,  and a written report on the completed projects will be submitted  for
              an annual publication.  Once completed, each project will be  given to the
              person for whom it is designed.  The hope is that  this "real world" experience
              will give engineering students a  sense of purpose and pride, help engineering
              schools serve the  community, attract new students into engineering, and raise 
              student interest in graduate education.    This type of undertaking is
              important since it provides a  meaningful experience for engineering students
              as part of their  undergraduate design requirements, and will also benefit a 
              population where customization is often needed for rehabilitation  devices.
