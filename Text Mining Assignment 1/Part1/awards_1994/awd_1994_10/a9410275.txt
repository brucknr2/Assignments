Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  George Chase  CTS-9410275      It is proposed to investigate the
              filtration processes of water drainage and fine particle retention, with
              special relevance to the operation of the wet-end of paper machines.  Cake
              filtration and particle retention in deep beds will be simulated, and the
              material coefficients will be obtained from experiments.  The deformation
              behavior of wet pulp mates as a function of the applied pressure, flow rate and
              pulp properties will be determined in laboratory.  The fine particle retention
              will be measured by sectioning, electron  microscopy, and gravimetric method. 
              This project will be performed by collaboration between G. G. Chase of Akron
              University, Akron, OH, and B. V. Ramarao of SUNY, Empire State Paper Research
              Institute, Syracuse, NY.  Cost sharing is provided by both institutions.    If
              successful, the resulted predictive model for cake information will be used to
              evaluate filtration processes under dynamic conditions, with particular
              application in the paper making machine and other manufacturing processes.  ***
