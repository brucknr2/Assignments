Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  Jeffrey Marshall  CTS-9410075    The Iowa State Institute of Hydraulic
              Research at the University of Iowa will purchase a Particle Image Velocimetry
              (PIV) system, which will be dedicated to support  research in fluid mechanics
              and hydraulic engineering.  The PIV system will be used for the following
              research project:  (1) a study of the cutting of a columnar vortex be a blade
              and the subsequent response of the vortex, which includes propagation of a
              traveling vortex breakdown away from the blade, (2) a study of the secondary
              vortex structure which forms about the core region of a turbulent cortex, (3) a
              study of the dynamics and chaotic breakup of vortices in stably stratified
              quasi-geostrophic flows and (4) a study of the formation of vortices in
              hydraulic intake systems.  In addition to these specific research projects, the
              PIV system will enhance the general research capabilities with a semi-global
              measurement of fluid flows, which will provide a complement to the single-point
              measurement instrumentation presently in use.  ***
