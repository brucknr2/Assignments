Abstract    :
              Robert H. Todd  9410494       This project is a workshop on capstone senior
              engineering  design courses.  The workshop will bring together engineering 
              educators from all over the country to exchange information on  capstone
              experiences.  The ties to engineering design research are  a significant part
              of the program.       These capstone design courses are seen as an important
              link in  transferring our country's research results into industrial  practice.
               This workshop will accelerate the improvement of these  courses across the
              country, and in turn improvement of American  manufacturing.
