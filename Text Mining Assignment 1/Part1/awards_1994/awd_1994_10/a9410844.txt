Abstract    :
              9410844  Hagelberg  A high resolution study of linear and non-linear
              interactions  within the Equatorial Pacific carbonate system over the past 4 
              m.y., using GRAPE as a CaC03 proxy.  Record of this proxy from ODP  Leg 138 and
              its detailed oxygen-isotopic data will be used to learn  more about the
              dynamics of the carbonate system.
