Abstract    :
              9410501  Stahl  This research will develop an alternative  theory of  strategic
              thinking that would allow for a population of  players with a variety of
              thought processes, would be  empirically testable, and would yield more
              accurate  predictions of human behavior. The analysis of the  experimental data
              is expected to answer the following  questions, among others:       - How well
              does the model predict relative to  alternative theories?       - How robust is
              the determination of the type of a  specific player         from that player's
              choices? Is the tpye of  identification invariant         over a variety and
              number of games, and is it valid  for predicting         out-of-sample
              behavior?       - Can extra-ordinary subjects be detected?       - Assuming
              that players are given complete information  about the past         choices of
              the population, is it reasonable to assume  that the         various types
              would incorporate that information?  The study is significant because it
              provides results that  would enrich our understanding of individual decision
              making  in strategic settings.
