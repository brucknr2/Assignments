Abstract    :
              9410297  Kats    Cannibalism has been documented in a wide variety of kinds of
              animals.  However,   given recent emphasis on predator-prey interactions, few
              studies have examined   mechanisms that mediate predation on members of the
              same species.  Adult   California newts prey on both eggs and larvae of the
              same species.  Dr. Kats has   demonstrated in both laboratory and field
              experiments that newt larvae respond to   chemical cues from adults by
              increasing the amount of time they spend in refuge.    On 2 November 1993, a
              wildfire burned Dr. Kats's primary study site near Malibu,   California.  There
              are virtually no studies on the effects of major fire disturbances on   animal
              behavior.  To determine the effects of fire on chemically mediated newt  
              cannibalism, Dr. Kats and his students will test two hypotheses:  (1)  Changes
              in   stream water caused by runoff from recently burned hillsides will
              interfere with the   detection of intraspecific predator cues by California
              newt larvae, and (2)  changes   in stream water caused by runoff from recently
              burned hillsides will interfere with   the egg-eating behavior of adult
              California newts.    These hypotheses are particularly exploratory in nature
              because no previous study   has attempted to examine the effects of wildfire on
              chemically mediated animal   behavior.  Results from the experiments to be
              conducted by Dr. Kats and his   students could make significant contributions
              to understanding the effects of   unpredictable environmental disturbances and
              perturbations (wildfire in this case) on   behavioral interactions.
