Abstract    :
              9410850  Starace       Short pulse laser detachment of negative ions in both 
              parallel and crossed static electric and magnetic fields are  examined using a
              variety of theoretical and computational  techniques.  The effects of the
              fields on the detachment cross  section resulting from two coherent laser pulse
              excitations will  be carried out.  The results of the theoretical calculations
              will  enable an understanding of the coherent control of atomic  continuum
              processes.  ***
