Abstract    :
              9410396  France  A significant reason for the rare use of formal specification 
              techniques (FSTs) in the software development industry is a lack  of
              understanding of how FSTs can be incorporated into current  industrial-strength
              software development processes.  Current  industrial software development
              environments tend to favor the  use of informal Structured Specification
              Methods(SSMs) and Object-  Oriented Methods(OOMs) because of their use of
              relatively simple,  intuitive notations and concepts.  Lack of understanding of
              how  FSTs can be effectively applied in the context of practical  development
              processes based on SSMs and OOMs often leads to the  perception that the use of
              one precludes the other.  This  research is concerned with bridging the gap
              between FSTs and the  less formal SSMs and OOMs.  The research program has
              three  components:  the technical component is concerned with how  integration
              of formal and informal techniques is accomplished,  the organizational
              component is concerned with when, how, and  under what circumstances integrated
              specification techniques can  be applied, and the experimental component is
              concerned with  evaluating the techniques, supporting tools and processes
              through  experimental application.  ***
