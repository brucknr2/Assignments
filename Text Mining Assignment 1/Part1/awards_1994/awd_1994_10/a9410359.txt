Abstract    :
              9410359  Gadh       The long-term goal of the current research is to develop a  
              fundamentally new approach to computer-aided geometric design which  
              integrates a features-based design approach with feature   abstraction from
              boundary representation surface or solid  models.   The focus of this research
              activity is on the  determination of  features generated in a
              design-by-features/loops  environment.       The features-based design approach
              in the current research    uses an abstract geometric entity called a loop;
              features are   defined in terms of loops.  A designer may design in terms of
              high-   level features such as the rib or boss, and subsequently, may   modify
              features by modifying loops.  The loop provides the designer   the flexibility
              to generate creative designs thus providing a   function that is lacking in
              existing design-by-features approaches.    Whether designing by features or by
              loops, new features - that are   not intentionally created - get formed.  These
              features often   affect issues such as manufacturability, assemblability etc. 
              These   features are determined via a set of loop mappings (or feature  
              mappings).  Determination of these mappings and their completeness   are
              studied in this research.  A computer implementation of these   mappings is
              performed and verified by industry experts.
