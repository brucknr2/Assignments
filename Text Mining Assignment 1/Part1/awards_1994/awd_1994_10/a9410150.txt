Abstract    :
                    9410150  Kellett  This Research Initiation Award is to support research in
              alumina-  graphite composites for potential applications as self lubricating 
              bearing seals.  The colloidal processing and pressureless sintering 
              characteristics of alumina-graphite composites will be studied to  optimize
              properties.  Graphite orientation has an important  influence on wear and
              friction because of a propensity to flake off  and sintering aids in improved
              high temperature properties.  This  project will attempt to study how to
              combine these characteristics  to achieve the optimal properties.  ***
