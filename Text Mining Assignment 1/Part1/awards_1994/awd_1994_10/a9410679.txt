Abstract    :
              9410679  Chan       It is proposed to investigate combinatorial properties of 
              convex polytopes and more general polyhedral complexes which can  be decomposed
              in an orderly fashion.  Such complexes are called  shellable.  Shellability has
              proved to be an important tool in  the combinatorics of convex polytopes.  The
              focus will be on a  combinatorial invariant called the toric h-vector, which in
               certain cases is simply a fixed linear transformation of the  vector of
              face-numbers of the given complex.  Until recently the  only known
              interpretation of the toric h-vector of an arbitrary  rational polytope came
              from toric variety theory, but recently  McMullen discovered a combinatorial
              meaning involving the  polytope algebra, in the case of simplicial polytopes.  
               McMullen's famous g-theorem says that the toric hvectors of  simplicial
              polytopes are characterized by the Macaulay  inequalities.  An attempt will be
              made to determine whether  the same (or stronger) inequalities hold for toric
              h-vectors of  other shellable complexes.  Aside from shelling techniques, it 
              might be possible to use the polytope algebra, which will also be  studied.  Of
              special interest to the investigator and  collaborators will be zonotopes,
              which are orthogonal projections  of higher dimensional cubes.  ***
