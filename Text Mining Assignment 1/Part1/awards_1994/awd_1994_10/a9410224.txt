Abstract    :
              9410224  Lumpp  Economical manufacturing of high density microelectronic
              circuits depends on two critical factors: fabrication of fine pitch electrical
              interconnections and cost reduction by integration of processing steps.  Both
              of these issues are addressed by using ultraviolet light to define circuit
              patterns.  The new procedures utilize ultraviolet excimer lasers to locally
              decompose AIN and A12O3 surfaces to pattern high resolution metal lines for
              additive deposition of films without photolithography processing.  Laser
              assisted chemical vapor deposition (CVD) from dimethylaluminum hydride produces
              a patterned seed layer by direct writing with the laser beam.  Thin films are
              grown by selective area thermal CVD on the decomposed and seeded regions.  In
              practice, adhesion of thick films on AIN has been poor due to nitrogen bubbles
              formed when the glass phase in the ink oxidizes the substrate.  Thick film
              density is improved by screen printing onto decomposed regions so that the
              metallized surface is oxidized without blistering the film.  Metallized vias
              are fabricated by laser ablation of the substrate and a detachable metal
              backing.  Electrical properties of films, vias and laser modified surfaces are
              correlated with chemical analysis results and evaluation of microstructural
              development.  ***
