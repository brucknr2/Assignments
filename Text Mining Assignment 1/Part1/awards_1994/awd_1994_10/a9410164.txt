Abstract    :
                9410164  Li       The proposed research is concerned with mathematical 
              modelling in economics and the underlying mathematical problems  by both
              theoretical and numerical analysis. The project consists  of two parts.  The
              first part is on the modelling of the  so-called open-market operations and the
              second part on the  market uncertainty.  For both parts of the research, it is 
              proposed to refine some existing models and develop some possible  new models. 
              Theoretical analyses are proposed with the  use of techniques such as nonlinear
              functional analysis,  probability, and dynamical systems erical blems.  It is
              proposed  to design various numerical algorithms and analyze their  convergence
              and stability, and develop numerical codes to be used  for simulation as well
              as for guiding the proposed theoretical  studies.  ***
