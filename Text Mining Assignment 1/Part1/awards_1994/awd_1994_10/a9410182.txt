Abstract    :
              9410182  Matzkin    Most existing tests of economic models proceed by first, 
              specifying the functions in the model up to some parameters.   Next, the
              parameters are estimated, and a test for the  restrictions that the model
              implies on the values of the  estimated parameters is performed.  This
              procedure suffers  typically from two drawbacks.  First, if the restrictions
              are  rejected, it is not clear whether this is due to a wrong model or  a wrong
              parametric specification.  And second, if the  restrictions are not rejected,
              it is not clear whether this  implies any strong evidence in favor of the
              model, since the  restrictions were only necessary and not sufficient.  This 
              project addresses these problems by developing new methods for  the
              identification, estimation, and testing of nonparametric  models.     First,
              the project will determine how several types of  restrictions, such as
              inequality restrictions and optimizing  behavior, can be used to guarantee the
              identification of  functions in systems of nonparameteric simultaneous
              equations.   The systems that will be considered include those with 
              unobservable endogenous variables, discrete variables, and  nondifferentiable
              functions.  The results of this research will  be useful to econometricians
              interested in estimating systems of  equations that are either nonparametric or
              nonlinear in  parameters.  Second, the project develops nonparametric 
              restrictions characterizing the behavior of observable variables  in economic
              models.  The results will be useful to falsify  specific theories using
              observable behavior.  Finally, the  project develops estimators for
              nonparametric functions in  systems of equations using weighted average methods
              and shape-  restricted methods.
