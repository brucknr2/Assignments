Abstract    :
              9410158  Lever  It is apparent that intelligent techniques necessary to  control
              machine / environment interactions for autonomous  excavation operations at
              complex rock excavation sites  require further investigation. The first
              objective of the  proposed research is to mount sensors, actuators and a 
              control CPU on a real mini-excavator arm. collect bucket  force/torque sensor
              data during actual excavation tasks, and  then develop sensor data reduction
              techniques needed for its  intelligent control. The second objective is to
              develop and  implement a new intelligent control approach that utilizes  fuzzy
              behaviorq with fuzzy strategies to control bucket  motions for autonomous
              excavation tasks. This approach uses  feedback from bucket mounted force
              sensors to control  excavation motions by sensing and reacting to interactions 
              with rock particles during excavation task.  ***
