Abstract    :
              9410218  Barbone  Proposed in this RIA research project is the study of a  model
              which consists of an acoustic beam of finite width  propagating normally into a
              laminated dissipative half-space  containing randomly distributed point
              scatters.    This  problem combines many of the essential difficulties 
              encountered in imaging parenchymal tissue: inhomogeneity on  many scales,
              non-constant attenuation, random scattering,  and backscatter from interfaces. 
              The goals of the  asymptotic analysis correspond to the two stages in the 
              research plan:  (1) to formulate a diffraction -corrected  one-dimensional
              inverse problem consistent with the three-  dimensional imaging problem, and
              (2) to examine different  averaging techniques for the random scattering and
              determine  their applicability to texture analysis.  ***
