Abstract    :
              9410703  Sambanis  One of the most promising advances in the treatment of
              diabetes  in recent years has been the demonstration in animals that beta 
              cells or complete eyelets encapsulated in a material that allows  the free
              diffusion of glucose and insulin can function in vivo  without being rejected. 
              The potential to develop this into a  biologically based artificial organ and
              providing natural control  of glucose levels would be great for
              insulin-dependent diabetes.  The research proposed in this application is
              concerned with the  development of a bio-artificial pancreas which is
              functional in  the long-term, easily implantable, relatively inexpensive, and 
              amenable to large scale manufacture.  The work employs the use of  existing
              biomaterials to encapsulate living, cultured beta cells,  and to focus on
              characterizing and improving the function of  these cells in this
              immuno-isolated environment.  ***
