Abstract    :
                                                  9410564  Arruda  This Research Initiation
              Proposal is made to investigate the  constitutive response, including
              birefringence, of elastomeric  networks under large deformations.  Moreover the
              contributions of  defects to the stress and bitefringence response will be
              accounted  for in the model.  Polydimethlysiloxane (PDMS) networks will be 
              synthesized to experimentally investigate the responses of network  elastomers.
               These experiments will systematically examine the  effect of variation in
              elastomer chain network structure on the  responses.  (**
