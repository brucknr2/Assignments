Abstract    :
              As functional MRI provides a new way to study human brain  functions, it becomes
              increasingly important to improve the  temporal resolution of the experiments
              so that rapid transient  neuronal events can be captured.  In conventional
              Fourier  transform-based imaging methods, each of the dynamic images is 
              acquired independently so that the temporal resolution possible is  limited by
              the number of data points collected in Fourier space to  achieve a certain
              level of spatial resolution.  This research seeks  to overcome this problem by
              incorporating a priori information into  the imaging process.  Specifically,
              new optimal methods for data  acquisition and image reconstruction are being
              developed that  exploit both the underlying model for the signal as well as the
               available a priori information about both the object being imaged  and the
              dynamic changes.  These methods promise to give more that  an order of
              magnitude of improvement in imaging efficiency over the  traditional Fourier
              imaging methods, and should find application in  a variety of dynamic imaging
              problems, particularly in real-time  imaging of functional brain activities.
