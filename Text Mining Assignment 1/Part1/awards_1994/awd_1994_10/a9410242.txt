Abstract    :
              9410242  Perkins  The primary objective of this research is the development of
              an  efficient control for semiconductor manufacturing systems.  To  achieve
              this objective, two subproblems will be solved.  The  overall aggregate control
              will then be an intuitive blend of  these results.  The first subproblem is to
              determine an optimal  control for a re-entrant manufacturing system with buffer
              costs.   The method of solution is to exploit structural properties, such  as
              piecewise continuity and monotonicity, of an optimal control  in order to
              reduce the problem to one with a known solution.  The  second subproblem is to
              determine the effect of the control on  several unreliable machines.  It will
              be show that, for a certain  class of controls, the buffer level probability
              densities satisfy  a set of linear, hyperbolic partial differential equations. 
              The  solution of these equations will be explored using numerical, and 
              simulation methods.  The aggregate control will partition the  system buffers
              using three criteria: machine reliability, buffer  utilization, and
              distribution of the down and up times of  machines.  The results of the
              subproblems will then be used to  determine the appropriate controls.  In
              addition, regulators will  be implemented to smooth out the material flow, thus
              reducing  second-order effects.  Simulation will be used to test the 
              efficiency of the aggregate control.  ***
