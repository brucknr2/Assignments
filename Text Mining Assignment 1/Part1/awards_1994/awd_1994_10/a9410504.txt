Abstract    :
              9410504  Demallie  This Dissertation Improvement research is an ethnographic and
               ethnohistorical analysis of the effects of one piece of federal  Indian
              policy--The Dawes Act--on Lakota Sioux identity.  It  examines the local social
              categories of "fullblood," and "white"  in a South Dakota county that seceded
              from Pine Ridge Indian  Reservation in 1912.  This study explores the linkages
              between  the creation and maintenance of such local social categories and 
              federal Indian policies.  Additionally, this is the first study  to pay special
              attention to the settlement of the area by both  Lakotas, who were relegated to
              the area through the reservation  system, and non-Indians who homesteaded the
              area when it was  opened to non-Indian settlement.  This study employs
              traditional  anthropological methods of participant-observation and the 
              recording of life histories from consultants in all three social  categories
              who are as old as or older than the county itself.   Coupled with the
              anthropological data, the examination of  historical and ethnohistorical
              documents written in both English  and Lakota languages will illuminate ongoing
              processes involved  in the maintenance of social categories in Bennett County.
