Abstract    :
                  The PIs propose to develop theoretical and practical methods that can help
              determine effective temporal pricing and allocation decisions.  The reason this
              is particularly important to many US industries is that unsold capacity at the
              end of a sales horizon has negligible value.  Therefore it is essential that
              within each sales horizon temporal pricing and capacity allocation decisions be
              optimal.  The PIs propose a program of empirical studies which will involve the
              participation of the Federal Department Stores.
