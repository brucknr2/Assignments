Abstract    :
              9410313  Chong  This proposal deals with issues in parametric and nonparametric 
              decision and control problems for Discrete Event Systems (DESs).   DESs are
              dynamical systems that are driven by the occurrence of  physical events, and
              arise in virtually all man-made systems,  including manufacturing systems,
              communication networks,  distributed computer systems, logistic systems, and
              vehicular  traffic.  The proposal considers performance oriented DES models, 
              and focuses on the problem of performance optimization.  Methods  for
              optimizing DESs have received significant interest in recent  years, and show
              tremendous promise for the development of  efficient ways to optimize
              large-scale complex man-made systems.    An objective of the study is to couple
              perturbation analysis  methods with optimization algorithms (both parametric
              and  nonparametric), with the aim of gaining further rigorous  understanding
              into when and why they work, and developing  algorithms and tools that will be
              useful in DES decision and  control problems.  This work emphasizes
              applications in  manufacturing systems, communication networks, and real-time 
              computer systems.  ***
