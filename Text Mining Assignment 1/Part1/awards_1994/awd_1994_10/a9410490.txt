Abstract    :
              9410490  Culver  The proposed research is in the Undergraduate Design Projects 
              Program category, and requests support for undergraduate and  graduate student
              engineers to provide prototype "custom designed"  devices and software to aid
              persons with disabilities.  The  primary goal of this thrust is to provide
              meaningful design  experience for the engineering student that will directly
              aid a  specific disabled individual.  A formal program is in place at  SUNY
              Binghamton which will ensure satisfactory progress is  attained on these
              projects.  A group of students and the  investigators on the grant will work
              with a number of  collaborating agencies and individuals on these projects. 
              Fifty-  five projects are planned during the five ear duration of this  award,
              and a written report on the completed projects will be  submitted for an annual
              publication.  Once completed, each  project will be given to the person for
              whom it is designed.  The  hope is that this "real world" experience will give
              engineering  students a sense of purpose and pride, help engineering schools 
              serve the community, attract new students into engineering, and  raise student
              interest in graduate education.    This type of undertaking is important since
              it provides a  meaningful experience for engineering students as part of their 
              undergraduate design requirements, and will also benefit a  population where
              customization is often needed for rehabilitation  devices.  ***
