Abstract    :
                9410038  Haltiwanger  This conference is organized by the National Bureau of 
              Economic Research, and it focuses on measurement issues in  labor statistics.
              The specific aim of the organizers is to  bring together economists and
              statisticians from a wide  variety of backgrounds to address current issues in
              the  labor market, such as, earnings inequality, employee  compensation,
              employment and unemployment patterns, etc.       This conference is of
              significant interest given the  recent attention at the Bureau of Labor
              Statistics in  designing long-term survey instruments to collect  information
              on the link between workers and employers.
