Abstract    :
               This proposal requested support to develop a new experimental technique
              utilizing a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) to obtain dynamic and
              quantitative data of liver tissue during freezing.  The reserch will validate
              and characterize the DSC technique by obtaining biophysical parameters of a
              known cell type during the freezing process; investigate a simulated
              cryosurgery by monitoring the effects of the freeze thaw-cycle and cooling
              rate; and utilize the quantative data to construct a thermodynamic predictive
              model of tissue freezing.
