Abstract    :
              9410897  Saberi              Almost every physical system has maximum and
              minimum limits  or otherwise called saturation on its control signal or
              actuator.   The task of designing feedback laws for linear systems with 
              saturating inputs is very complex and challenging.  Perhaps due  to this
              complexity, the effect of saturation of actuators has  been ignored in most of
              the modern control literature.  This  proposal seeks to develop both the
              analysis and design tools for  systems with saturating actuators.  Our initial
              work shows that a  semi-global framework is a natural and desirable framework
              for  the design of such systems.  Our recent effort also indicates the 
              emergence of powerful techniques for designing systems with  saturating
              actuators.         This proposal focuses on some of the central and fundamental
               control problems for systems with saturating actuators.  Among  the many
              problems which must be confronted are: robust semi-  global stabilization,
              robust semi-global disturbance rejection  and semi-global output regulation and
              tracking.  ***
