Abstract    :
              Professor John Ross is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and  
              Computational Chemistry Program to continue his research involving  
              experimental and theoretical studies of irreversible processes.  Ross   will
              conduct research in three specific areas including: 1) computational   studies
              of macroscopic chemical kinetic systems to explore the   possibility of pattern
              recognition by different types of nonlinear   systems; 2) development of a
              methodology for categorizing complex   reaction mechanisms based on
              stoichiometric network analysis; and 3)   experimental and theoretical studies
              on the thermodynamics and stochastic   formulation of chemical systems far from
              equilibrium.    Ross has recently shown that mass coupled continuously stirred
              tank   reactors (CSTRs) can emulate bistable switching devices and could be  
              considered as computer logic elements.  Combinations of such devices   could
              also emulate the basic logic gates such as AND, OR and NOR gates.    This work
              may serve as a model for biological neurons, and answer   fundamental questions
              regarding the mechanism of computation and pattern   recognition in living
              systems including the human brain.
