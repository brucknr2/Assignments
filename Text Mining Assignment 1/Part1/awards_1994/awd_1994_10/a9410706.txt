Abstract    :
              9410706  Franklin  The multiscalar processor is a recently proposed execution 
              paradigm for exploiting instruction-level parallelism.   It  is a collection of
              sequential processors that are connected  together in a logically decoupled and
              physically  decentralized manner using ring-type network.  The central  idea is
              to divide an instruction stream into blocks of  instructions, and then exploit
              parallelism by executing  these blocks using multiple processing elements.  The
               multiscalar processor has generated wide interest, both in  the academia and
              the industry, and seems to have tremendous  potential to become the processing
              paradigm of choice for a  circa 2000 intruction level parallel processor.   
              The purpose of this research is to develop a high  performance fault tolerant
              multiscalar processor and to  provide an impetus to the incorporation of fault
              tolerance  in general purpose processors.  The primary manner fault  tolerance
              will be incorporated in the multiscalar processor  is by run-time replication
              of software and by executing the  replicas on the processor's multiple
              execution units, which  are provided for performance reasons.  Two re-execution
               schemes (both using the same replication technique) are  under investigation. 
              Preliminary simulation studies have  been conducted to get an idea of the
              performance loss  incurred because of fault tolerance.  These preliminary 
              results indicate that time-redundant techniques are an  excellent choice for
              providing fault tolerance in the  multiscalar processor.  ***
