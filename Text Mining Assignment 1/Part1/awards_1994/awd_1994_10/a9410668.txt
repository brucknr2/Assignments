Abstract    :
              941068  Heegard       The 1994 IEEE International Symposium on Information
              Theory  will be held at the Technical University of Trondheim in Norway  from
              Sunday evening, June 27, 1994 through Friday afternoon, July  1, 1994. Papers
              presented will address new results in:   applications of information theory,
              image and speech coding,  communication systems, multi-user information theory,
              cryptography  and security, neural networks, data compression, optical 
              communications, data networks, pattern recognition, detection and  estimation,
              Shannon theory, distributed information processing,  signal processing,
              error-control coding. source coding, and  stochastic processes.        This
              symposium is a premiere meeting in the field of  Information theory. Travel
              through this grant will provide travel  support for young researchers
              presenting papers.  ***
