Abstract    :
              9410201  Roy  Large scale random forces acting on a dynamic systems can  cause
              deviation much above the critical threshold response  level. After that level,
              the system may immediately fail or  it may switch to another unwanted regime,
              such as the  capsizing of ships in rough seas, free standing structural 
              failure due to ground motions during an earthquake, and  extinction or
              explosion of biological populations due to  random environmental fluctuations.
              In this research project,  the probability of occurences is determined
              analytically  using nonlocal, asymptotic methods via Markov process  theory.
              Both single and multiple degree-of-freedom systems  are considered with
              wide-band or narrow-band, Gaussian or  non-Gaussian  random excitation.
              Comprehensive digital  simulations are conducted to assess the range of
              validity of  the asymptotic methods. In addition, analog electronic 
              experiments of the mathematical formulations are conducted  which provide a
              useful hands-on complement to digital  simulations of nonlinear stochastic
              dynamics.  ***
