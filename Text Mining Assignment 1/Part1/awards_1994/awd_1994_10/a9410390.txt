Abstract    :
                  9410390  Hasslotis  In this research planning grant a complete literature
              review will  be taken into the state-of-the-art to identify the needs of the 
              research community.  In addition, preliminary computational work  will be
              conducted to asses the feasibility of several proposed  projects.  These
              projects include a search for the best modes and  degrees of  freedom to
              measure for accurate structural  identification, the determination of the
              optimal placement of  actuators and sensors in active control, and the
              improvement of  algorithms used in the identification of damage.  Such research
               will be helpful in the development of non-destructive methods for  evaluation
              the condition and remaining life of civil engineering  structures, as well as
              in the design of more reliable and safer  structures.
