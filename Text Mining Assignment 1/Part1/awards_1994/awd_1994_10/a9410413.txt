Abstract    :
              The research focusses on development of Field-programmable Analog  Arrays
              (FPAA).  The main objective is to search for generic analog  arrays which can
              be used for realization of analog circuits and  systems.  Several configurable
              analog block styles with different  granularities are considered to arrive at
              optimal configurable  analog blocks.  The research also includes considerations
              of  architectural and interconnection issues.
