Abstract    :
              9410379  Baldwin  On February 21, 1994, the National Technological University 
              will deliver the fifth annual Discover Engineering  teleconference as part of
              Engineers Week Celebration.  This  live teleconference is two-fold.  First, the
              program  provides U.S. middle and high school students (and their  teachers)
              with an interesting insight into the work of  engineers in a novel
              teleconference setting. Secondly, the  Discover Engineering telecast is the
              centerpiece of open  houses at many industrial, government and college
              locations.  The telecast series is central to many local activities  wherein
              engineers welcome students and teachers to the  workplace, providing tours and
              wrap around discussions which  are stimulated by the telecast.    Since this
              proposal is for conducting a teleconference, it  is exempt from peer review in
              accordance with NSF Manual No.  10, Section 122.1-3.  Award of a grant is
              recommended.            William Butcher
