Abstract    :
              9410403  Linderman  This project is on research to study the relationship
              between  receptor number, ligand-receptor binding kinetics, G-protein  number
              and cellular responses.  This involves the systematic  manipulation of binding
              kinetics and the quantitative  characterization of complex intracellular
              responses.  The  neutrophil cell responses to N-formyl peptides will be used as
              a  model system for this study.  The specific objectives of the  research are:
              (1) to examine the role of N-formyl peptide  receptors by varying the number
              participating in signal  transduction; (2)  to examine the role of G-proteins
              by varying  the number participating in signal transduction; (3) to develop a 
              mathematical model of receptor binding and G-protein activation;  and (4) to
              verify the model by predicting cell responses when  receptor and G-protein are
              manipulated.  This research could lead  to both improved cell response and the
              design of pharmaceuticals.  ***
