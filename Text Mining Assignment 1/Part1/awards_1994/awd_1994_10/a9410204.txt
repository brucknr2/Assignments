Abstract    :
              Abstract  UCAR Cooperative Agreement  Carlson, David  Subject: TOGA COARE
              International Project Office (ITCPO)    This award to UCAR will support the
              community-wide data management  and workshop activities of the TOGA COARE
              research project.  The  funds will be provided to the International TOGA COARE
              Project  Office, which had the responsibility for implementing TOGA COARE  and
              now has the responsibility for its data management and for  organizing its
              workshops.  This increment of funding follows  earlier ones in FY 1992 and FY
              1993 and reflects an interagency  commitment to continue supporting TOGA COARE
              research.    This work is important because it enables UCAR to develop the data
               sets necessary for NSF, NOAA and NASA researchers to perform their  TOGA COARE
              studies and to interact at PI workshops.
