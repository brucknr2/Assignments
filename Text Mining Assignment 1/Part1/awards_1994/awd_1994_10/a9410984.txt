Abstract    :
              9410984  Raghavan       The focus of this proposal is the modeling of the 
              functional dependence of non-Gaussian response variables on a  given set of
              predictors. Examples of this include the logistic  regression model, where the
              response is binary and the log-linear  Poisson model where the response
              represents counts of incidents  in a given time interval. The function of
              interest is estimated  nonparametrically, using generalized smoothing splines. 
               Inferential procedures based on a Bayesian formulation, wherein a  stochastic
              process prior is imposed on this function, will be  investigated.  A more
              complete answer requires finite sample  calculations which is a computationally
              imposing task. Monte  Carlo methods for analysis of the posterior will be
              explored.  ***
