Abstract    :
              aThis research focuses on a number of issues that are central to  better
              underlying the dynamics of business cycles.  The model to  be developed allows
              for variation in work effort and capital  utilization over time. It takes into
              account the fact that most  workers have long-term attachments to their
              employers, which  makes them willing to adjust their work effort with no
              immediate  change in pay. The model also takes into account increasing  returns
              to scale in production, the pricing behavior of firms,  and the tendency for
              prices to remain fixed despite changes in  economic conditions, and investment
              behavior.  In addition,  people's consumption and labor supply choices are
              modeled as a  joint decision.  This research will give us a better 
              understanding of the factors affecting the fluctuation of  productivity over
              the business cycle and the prospects for long-  term productivity growth.
