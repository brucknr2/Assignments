Abstract    :
              9410269  Srebro  The research proposed in this application is concerned with 
              developing methods for functional brain imaging extrapolated  from a series of
              experiments on human subjects; cortical  dipole moment estimation based on
              combined measurements from  an array of electrical scalp measurements, MR fast
              gradient  echo images of blood flow, and regularized least-squares  estimation
              will be performed.  The research has three major  objectives: (1) to explore
              several strategies for inverting  the scalp field in a model of the human head
              that mimics the  anatomy of the brain, skull and scalp with good fidelity,  (2)
              to develop the methods required to apply the inversion  methods to patients and
              (3) to compare the results to MR  measurements of evoked blood volume change
              using the same  subjects and the same stimuli.  MR blood volume measurements 
              restrict the region of cortex that must be search for a  solution to the EP
              scalp field inversion.  It is shown that  restricting the search space not only
              improves the accuracy  of the EP inversion, but also enhances its spatial 
              resolution.  Thus combining MR with EP inversion provides a  powerful tool to
              study human cortical function.  ***
