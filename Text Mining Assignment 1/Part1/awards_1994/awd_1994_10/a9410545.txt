Abstract    :
              9410545  Ausubel  This research will attempt to capture the essential features 
              of principal-agent relationships by studying a sequential  recontracting game
              between a seller of a divisible good and  a buyer whose type may influence the
              number of units that it  is efficient to trade. One key aspect of the model is
              that  the players can make the trade prescribed by the current  contract while
              still negotiating a new contract. The  research emphasis include:       -
              Analysis of the sequential contracting game under  incomplete         
              information.       - Extending the analysis to account for other types of 
              agency problems,          such as those incorporating moral hazard or relation-
               specific          investments.       - Application of the analysis to the
              principal-agent  problem between                       the shareholders and 
              management of a corporation, and to other  areas of substantive economic
              interest.  This study is important because the issue of recontracting  is
              fundamental to our understanding of the imporatnce of  property rights.
