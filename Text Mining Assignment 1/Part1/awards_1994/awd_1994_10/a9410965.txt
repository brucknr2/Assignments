Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  Mark Barteau  CTS-9410965    This is an investigation of  two
              carbon-carbon bond-forming reactions that occur on metal-oxide surfaces: 
              reductive carbonyl coupling and alkyne cyclotrimerization.  It has been
              demonstrated that both reactions can be run as gas-solid reactions on titania
              single crystals even in ultrahigh vacuum.  This research defines the mechanisms
              of these surface reactions in order to test analogies with liquid-phase
              organometallic reactions, and applies the understanding gained to the invention
              of new heterogeneous catalysts for novel surface organic syntheses.  The
              program includes spectroscopic investigations of carbon-carbon bond-forming
              reactions on reduced titania single crystals, steady-state and
              temperature-programmed flow reactor studies on oxide powders at atmospheric
              pressure (to demonstrate the "scale-up" from ultrahigh vacuum to normal
              industrial catalytic operations), and scanning probe microscopy experiments to
              probe active sites and adsorbed intermediates at the molecular level and to
              test the ability to manipulate these factors.    This effort is the centerpiece
              of a program to enable the transfer of traditionally esoteric surface chemistry
              to industrial practice through a series of "scale-up" stages, and thus
              rationalize the introduction of new catalytic chemistry into industrial
              technology.  ***
