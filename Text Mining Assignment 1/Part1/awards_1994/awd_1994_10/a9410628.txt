Abstract    :
              9410628  Forbes         During the past decade, the NSF and the aeronomy
              community  have conducted a science program called CEDAR (Coupling, Energetics 
              and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions).  Under this program, new  thrusts in
              theoretical modeling and new and upgraded experimental  capabilities using
              optical and radar techniques continue to be  developed.  To coordinate the
              effort among individual researchers  in the community and to provide scientific
              advice to the NSF, a  science steering committee exists with membership
              selected by the  NSF program officers.  This proposal requests funds to
              continue the  activities of this committee with Jeffrey Forbes, the principal 
              investigator, as Chair.  ***
