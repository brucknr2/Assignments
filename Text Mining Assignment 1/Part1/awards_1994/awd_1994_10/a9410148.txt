Abstract    :
              9410148  Walker    In recent years the Principal Investigators have been making
              nano-  scale magnetic thin-films, superlattices, and heterostructures by 
              Molecular Beam Epitaxy.  Not only do they produce new magnetic  materials by
              these techniques, but they also study fundamental  aspects of magnetism.  The
              group detect weak interlayer magnetic  coupling between thin (110) Iron layers
              through intervening layers  of (111) Silver and (111) Copper.  These studies
              are important for  understanding the mechanisms of giant magnetoresistance in
              these  multilayer systems.  This phenomenon is beginning to be exploited  for
              magnetic read-write heads for high density magnetic disk  memories.    %  %  % 
              %    This research involves making new magnetic materials by careful 
              engineering at the atomic level.  Normal magnetic materials such as  iron are
              alternated with both non-magnetic materials such as gold,  copper, silver and
              with other magnetic materials to make repeated  atomic-scale multilayer system
              whose magnetic properties can be  tailored to particular applications by
              controlling the relative  thickness of the various layers.  This area of
              research is being  vigorously pursued in a number of countries because of its 
              potential technological importance.  Already these materials are  coming into
              use by International Business Machines (IBM) to make  magnetic recording heads
              for very high density computer disks.  ***
