Abstract    :
              9412316  SARAT  This project supports a summer institute for interdisciplinary 
              training in sociolegal studies.  Thirty new entrants to the field,  some of
              whom are advanced graduate students and some new Ph.D's,  will participate in a
              four-day institute with a faculty of  distinguished scholars from the law and
              social science field,  including sociologists of law, psychologists of law, 
              anthropologists of law, political scientists, criminologists, and  academic
              lawyers.  Primary attention will be on crossdisciplinary  collaboration and on
              interdisciplinary ways of thinking about  research on the nexus between law and
              society.    The grant will support travel and subsistence for thirty 
              participants and ten faculty, as well as the publication of some  curricular
              materials prepared specifically for the institute.  ***
