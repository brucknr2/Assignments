Abstract    :
              9410485  Sundaram    The framework of Markovian or Stochastic games has been
              used to  analyze a great variety of issues in economics and game theory.   It
              is somewhat surprising then that, in contrast to the very  well-understood
              framework of repeated games, remarkably little is  known in general about the
              properties of abstract Markovian  games.  The first part of the project
              addresses open theoretical  questions about the existence of subgame-perfect
              equilibrium in  Markovian games, and the properties of the equilibrium set. 
              The  second part continues ongoing research by the investigators into  the
              applications of the Markovian game framework to economic  problems.  Research
              is continued on common-property resource  games, research and development in
              oligopoly, and repeated  elections and principal/agent games.  Two new classes
              of games  studied are those of information-processing and of natural-  resource
              exploitation.  The investigators plan to complete a  paper detailing the
              literature on the applications of Markovian  games and publish it jointly with
              an earlier paper providing a  detailed summary of available theoretical results
              on the  existence and properties of equilibrium in abstract Markovian  games as
              a monograph for other researchers and advanced graduate  students.
