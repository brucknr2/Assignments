Abstract    :
              9410303  Kohn  This Research Initiation Award allow fundamental studies by  the
              PI in focal areas of bone and implant biomechanics.  This research will provide
              a more quantitative understanding  of the factors controlling microdamage in
              compact bone.  By  detecting microdamage at an early stage, material failure 
              mechanisms can be related to microstructure and mechanical  parameters,
              yielding insight into potential mechanisms  governing failure.  Data from these
              studies will be of  benefit in identifying mechanisms of microdamage, failure 
              and remodeling in bone, and in the design of man-made  materials.  ***
