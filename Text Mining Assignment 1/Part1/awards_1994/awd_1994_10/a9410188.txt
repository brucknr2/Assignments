Abstract    :
              9410188  Chen       The investigator will study various Boussinesq systems which
               describe the two-way propagation of water waves in a nonlinear,  dispersive
              media.  The major goal for this project is to decide  which system of equations
              is best suited for the modelling of  physical problems in fluid mechanics.  The
              investigator will  study the systems both theoretically and numerically, and
              compare  results with laboratory experiments.  The investigator will also  be
              involved in developing and implementing an efficient algorithm  for the
              computer modelling of water waves through numerically  integrating the full
              Euler's equations.  The numerical results  obtained here will also provide a
              source for the verification of  Boussinesq systems.  In addition, the
              investigator will continue  research on the recently developed idea of Inertial
              Multigrid  Algorithms.  The dynamical behavior of the algorithms will be 
              studied from the perspective of bifurcation theory.        The investigator
              will study the bifurcation diagram  generated by the numerical approximation
              and compare it with that  of the underlying continuous problem.  In practice,
              this means  examining the numerical method for all range of the physical 
              parameters at once.  ***
