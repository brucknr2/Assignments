Abstract    :
              This project provides partial support for the Twenty-second Annual 
              Telecommunications Policy Research Conference, scheduled for  October 1-3,
              1994, in Solomons, Maryland.  The Conference convenes  national and
              international scholars in basic and applied research  from engineering,
              economics, operations research, law,  communications and information science,
              and public policy; leaders  in communications and information industries;
              specialists from  public-interest organizations; and government policymakers.  
                    Rapid growth in the field of communication and information  science and
              policy -- from initiatives in high speed networking to  changes in the
              traditional approach to communications and  information regulation -- provides
              few opportunities for the  research and public policy communities to exchange
              information.   Yet the significant interaction between national and
              international  policy, on the one hand, and the successful development and 
              improvement of communications and information technology, on the  other, are
              critical.  The Conference seeks to facilitate  communication of the results of
              the best available current basic  and applied research on communications and
              information topics, and  to foster the development of effective, coherent
              national and  international communications and information policy.  The 
              Conference also seeks to develop a salient basic and applied  research agenda
              for emerging issues, to encourage interdisciplinary  research early in the
              basic research process, and to integrate  basic and applied research from other
              countries.  In addition, the  Conference serves a highly effective educational
              role in informing  and encouraging new young researchers in communications and 
              information research and policy.
