Abstract    :
              Marschall     This project examines the spatial and temporal structure of nectar
              distribution in flowers in the field.  Spatial structure of resource
              distribution has usually been ignored in models of pollinator foraging behavior
              and decision making.  In this study the PI's measure the spatial organization
              of resource variability, and how the pattern changes with time of day.  These
              data will be incorporated into a series of foraging models.      This research
              has potential broad applicability to insect foraging behavior and behavioral
              ecology.  The results may help us better understand how decision-making rules
              that deal with complex situations are developed in honey bees, bumble bees, and
              other insects, and generally improve our understanding of animal cognitive
              psychology.
