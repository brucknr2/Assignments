Abstract    :
                The principal investigator proposes to develop a task environment for a series
              of experiments designed to investigate information processing in dynamic
              decision tasks.  These are tasks in which the responses to one decision
              influence the information available at the time of a later decision.  Two
              different studies are planned.  The first will use one or two response modes
              during an initial session and will either the same or different responses in
              the second (transfer) session.  The second experiment will evaluate changes in
              strategies as a result of changes in feedback about the system's outcomes.
