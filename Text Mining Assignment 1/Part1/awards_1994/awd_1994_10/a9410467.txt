Abstract    :
              9410467  Topoleski  This Research Initiation Award investigates the fundamental 
              mechanisms of wear in CoCr alloys, a critical step toward  improving artificial
              joint materials and the quality of life  for joint recipients, and reducing the
              cost of arthritis  care.  Wear is expected to become the major cause of 
              artificial joint failure, requiring costly revision surgery  and inducing
              irreparable bone damage.  In order to  synthesize new  materials, or modify
              existing materials to  resist wear, the fundamental wear mechanisms must be 
              understood.  Polyethylene wear is integrally linked to the  condition of the
              articulating metal component, yet research  of metal component wear has been
              practically neglected.  Failure analysis of in vivo CoCr wear is an essential 
              element of this research.  Surface roughness measurements  will provide
              quantification of wear.  Scanning electron  microscopy, Auger electron
              spectroscopy, an x-ray  photoelectron spectroscopy will be used to investigate
              the  wear surface.  In vitro wear testing to investigate the  mechanisms of
              wear, and the effect of wear surfaces on the  integrity of artificial joints
              will be based on the failure  analyses.  ***
