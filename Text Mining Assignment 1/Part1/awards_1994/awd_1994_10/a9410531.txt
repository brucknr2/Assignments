Abstract    :
              9410531  Megretski  The main project objective are:  to develop a unified
              approach to  the robustness and performance analysis of control systems in the 
              presence of mixed (real parametric, non-linear, slowly time  varying etc. 
              structured uncertainty and non-stochastic  correlated exogenous signals; to
              present a less conservative  linear feedback control synthesis procedure based
              on the  analysis; to implement the theoretical results in a set of  computer
              algorithms; and to test the method by applying it in the  practical problems of
              control of highly uncertain dynamics, such  as compressor antisurge control and
              greenhouse climate control.    The main method to be employed in the analysis
              part of the  project is based on describing (conservatively) each component of 
              uncertainty and noise by a set of Integral Quadratic Constraints  (IQC's). 
              Then the robust stability (or a prescribed level of  performance) is achieved
              if a certain system of Linear Matrix  Inequalities (LMI's), defined by the
              choice of IQC's has a  solution.  In the synthesis, a Projective
              Parameterization of the  set of admissible controllers will be used to reduce
              the problem  (possibly conservatively) to a system of LMI.  Alternatively, an 
              analog of the heuristic D-K Iteration algorithm will be studied.    The
              significance of the proposed research activity is in its  potential to enhance
              the power and extend the field of  application of many recently known methods
              of robust control  analysis, including u-synthesis, quadratic stability,
              positivity  theory and Kharitonov-type arguments.  ***
