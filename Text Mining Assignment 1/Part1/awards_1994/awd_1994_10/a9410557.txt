Abstract    :
              9410557  Huang  It is proposed to continue the study of Floqoet theory for 
              differential delay equations and dynamics of coupled oscillators.  In pratice,
              a system often depends  not only on its present  states but also on past
              states.  As a result, we are lead to the  study of differential delay 
              equations. Linear periodic systems  constitute a very important in the field of
              differential delay  equations.  Studying Floquet theory of such systems enables
              one  to understand the behavior and structure of their solutions. We  plan to
              extend our study of Floquet theory for linear  differential delay equations to
              broader classes of equations. We  would also like to investigate the conditions
              under which there  are no small solutions.  Models  of coupled osscillators
              arise  naturally from problems in physics and biology. Since in pratice, 
              oscillators can be coupled in many different ways,we  can get a  variety of
              equations that describe their motion.  To understand  the dynamics of these
              systems, we try to generalize the known  results for two coupled oscillators to
              them.  We also would like  to study the stabilities of the discrete rotating
              waves and  cluster solutions for globally coupled  oscillators.  ***
