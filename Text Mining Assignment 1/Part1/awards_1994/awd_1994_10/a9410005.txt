Abstract    :
              9410005  Bras       A growing concern about the environment, and especially
              about   waste and landfill, has spurred research into the design of more  
              environmentally benign products.  A dramatic reduction in   environmental
              impact can be made by product reuse in which, in   contrast to material
              recycling, the geometrical form of the product   is retained and its associated
              economical and environmental value   is preserved.  However, attempts to
              generate formal and systematic   design approaches which include environmental
              considerations such   as reusability as well as economical, mechanical and
              other design   considerations break down when confronted with the need to
              quantify   environmental properties and requirements.  In this research the 
              objective is to identify efficient and  effective metrics for  quantifying and
              enhancing reusability in  design.  In order to  achieve this objective,
              reusability metrics are postulated based on  life cycle factors affecting
              reusability of engineering systems.   A validation strategy is developed to
              determine the correctness and  validity of these metrics.  Among others, the
              postulated metrics  are verified using historical design and service data from 
              cooperating industrial partners. Uncertainty and variability are  key aspects
              which are taken into account as well.       Design of environmentally benign
              products is an area of  critical national importance.  Successful research
              results could be  used by the industrial design community to improve the
              product  development activities.  The project has strong industrial support.
