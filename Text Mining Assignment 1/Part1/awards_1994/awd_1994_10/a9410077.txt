Abstract    :
                The project focuses on two important inter-related issues in  the design of
              large scale parallel computers:  inter-processor communication  and
              fault-tolerance. The nature of  the research is one of synthesizing 
              theoretical and  practical approaches to parallel computing.    Efficient 
              inter-processor communication is at the heart of  efficient parallel computing.
               With some exceptions, much  of the theoretical work has focused on provably 
              optimal  algorithms that are often too complex to implement.  On the  other 
              hand, much of the implemented routing hardware have  simpler designs but lack 
              theoretical guarantees as to their  performance.  This project will attempt to 
              bridge this gap  and focus on simple routing schemes that are provably good 
              (though not always optimal).    Fault tolerance is becoming ever-increasingly 
              important in  the world of parallel computers with a large number of  fallible 
              components.  The study of fault-tolerant routing  schemes  focuses on
              algorithms  that can route packets  efficiently even in the presence of faulty
              switches.  The  two research directions represent very important but largely 
              uncharted  territory.  The first concerns the question of  intrinsic
              limitations on the  fault tolerance of networks.  The second research direction
              concerns  reconfiguring in  increasingly important class of parallel computers
              known as  heterogeneous parallel computers.
