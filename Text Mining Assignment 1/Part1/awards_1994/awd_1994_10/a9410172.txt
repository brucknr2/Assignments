Abstract    :
              This research is examining techniques for reducing the hardware  complexity for
              Decision Feedback Equalization (DFE) and Multi-level  Decision Feedback
              Equalization (MDFE) in hard disk drives.  Both  digital and analog circuit
              approaches are being investigated.  The  first part of this work concerns the
              testing of a digital  realization of DFE in an 0.8 mm process.  The projected
              operating  speed of this IC is about 100 MHz. Enhancements to the digital 
              circuitry will give improved strategies for optimal phase  detection, gain 
              detection and dc offset detection.    The second part of this work concerns the
              investigation of an  analog implementation of MDFE.  A simple architecture for
              MDFE,  which includes both the phase and the gain detectors, is being  studied
              for its robustness using actual playback waveforms.  From  this investigation,
              the circuits needed for  the transversal filters comprising MDFE will be
              obtained.  A  mixture of switched-capacitor and current-mode circuit techniques
               will be examined.
