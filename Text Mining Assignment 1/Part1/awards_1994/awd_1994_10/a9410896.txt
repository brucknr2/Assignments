Abstract    :
              9410896  Comfort  This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) award will 
              enable the investigator to collect perishable data on the  Northridge
              earthquake.  the study will involve investigating the  emergency system that
              evolved in response to the problems posed  by the earthquake and pay special
              attention to the role of  information and communication as that system
              developed.  Lessons  will be sought in the Northridge experience that have
              relevance  for reducing the vulnerability of communities to future  disasters.
