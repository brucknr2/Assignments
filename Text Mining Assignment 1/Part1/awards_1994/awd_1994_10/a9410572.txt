Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    Birnbaum, Michael H.  California State University at Fullerton 
              SBR-9410572    In collaboration with Ward Edwards (SBR-9409698) the PI proposes
              to study risk attitudes.  The PI will investigate the behavior and attitudes of
              people who participate in "The Big Spin," which is the California State
              Lottery's TV show.  The PI will be given access to the participants before,
              during, and after their participation in the televised portion of the lottery. 
              The risk attitudes of these persons will be compared at various time periods,
              and their responses will also be compared to the responses of a control group
              of non-participants.  A one-year follow-up of all participants is included in
              the design.
