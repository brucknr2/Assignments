Abstract    :
              Abstract  94-10929  Studies of the NOD kinesin-like protein found in Drosophila 
              melanogaster and its role in mediating achiasmate disjunction will  be
              continued. These studies are designed to test a model in which  the NOD
              kinesin-like protein is distributed along the length of the  chromosome arms
              and acts to push chromosomes away from the poles.  We also propose to continue
              our molecular and genetic studies of  the Axs gene and its role in allowing the
              proper separation of  achiasmate homologs. In the absence of normal Axs gene
              product,  achiasmate homologs fail to separate and cause the developing 
              spindle to buckle, fray or even break. Thus, a detailed  understanding of the
              Axs gene product will provide significant  insight into the manner by which
              achiasmate homologs are associated  prior to their separation. Finally, a
              screen designed to identify  mutations specifically defective in heterologous
              segregation will  be carried out. The subsequent molecular analysis of genes
              defined  by these mutations represents a long term goal of this proposal.  %%% 
              How chromosomes identify their partners and thereby allow the  orderly process
              of transmission of the correct number and types of  chromosomes to progeny is a
              central question in heredity. Work from  this laboratory has contributed much
              to our understanding of some  of the involved mechanisms. Genetic approaches
              have been used to  demonstrate that, in Drosophila females at least, there are
              two  separate systems of achiasmate segregation. The elucidation of the 
              physical bases of these processes at the molecular level is the  goal of this
              work.  ***
