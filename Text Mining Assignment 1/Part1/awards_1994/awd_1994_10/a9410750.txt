Abstract    :
                         This award supports the further development of the Micrograph Data
              Processing  Program (MDPP).  This software program supports image processing in
              the area of  structural biology image data from the electron microscope.  The
              project has several  goals.  First, MDPP will be ported to several different
              UNIX platforms.  Second, the  program will port the client/server code to
              TCP/IP.  Third, the project will develop a  tool-box of MOTIF subroutines
              designed to facilitate data entry to the MDPP.   Another goals will create a
              beginners guide to the software.
