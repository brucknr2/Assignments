Abstract    :
              9410596  Totah  University of Iowa  New chiral ligands based on the
              1,7-dioxaspiro 5.5 undecane ring system will be prepared and evaluated on their
              ability to induce asymmetry in organic transformations as well as their ability
              to serve as hosts to cationic guests. Enantioselectivity and complex
              configuration will be evaluated by GC, HPLC, NMR, and x-ray crystallographic
              analysis. Computer modeling will be used to understand enantioselectivity
              induced by these systems.    This Research Planning Grant from the Chemistry
              Division supports the research of Professor Nancy I. Totah at the University of
              Iowa. Molecules that complex metal ions and molecules that possess a positive
              charge will be prepared. These complexing molecules will also possess an array
              of atoms that is unique and related to either a right- or left-orientation. The
              term chiral ("handedness") is used for this particular type of array. These
              chiral complexes will be evaluated to determine if they will act as catalysts
              to incorporate chiral into molecules in chemical reactions.
