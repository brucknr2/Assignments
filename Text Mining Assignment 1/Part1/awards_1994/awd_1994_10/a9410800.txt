Abstract    :
              9410800  Liu    This research seeks to develop new methods to solve the
              Navier-Stokes equations using advanced two-equation turbulence models.  These
              new methods will permit the prediction of unsteady aerodynamic loads and hence
              will have applications in the design of turbines and compressors.  Current
              knowledge in these areas is based on steady flow models whereas the actual
              flows are highly unsteady.  The proposed work has both analytical and numerical
              components including:  development of a flux-limited pressure split dissipation
              model and k-w turbulence  model, algorithms for massively parallel computers
              and new techniques for solving both the Navier Stokes equations and the
              turbulence equations.  ***
