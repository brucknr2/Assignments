Abstract    :
              This activity is a planning grant supported under the Research  Opportunities
              for Women Program.  The purpose of this grant in to  allow the investigator to
              begin investigating and implementing   appropriate non-experimental estimation
              procedures to determine  the effectiveness of a government-funded compensatory
              education  program.  With the help of an unusually rich data set from the 
              Longitudinal Study of Children at Risk, the possibilities of  obtaining
              unbiased estimates of program effectiveness will be  explored.  Various
              estimation techniques will be employed in  order to determine the effects on
              student achievement and grade  retention of participation in a Head Start type
              program that  extends from  preschool into the primary grades.  A central 
              question of the broader study is: Can the often noted fading  effects of Head
              Start related programs be postponed or even  eliminated by extending the
              compensatory services into the  primary grades?
