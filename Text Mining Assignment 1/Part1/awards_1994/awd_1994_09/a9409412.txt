Abstract    :
              9409412  Paletz    This Doctoral dissertation Research Project determines the 
              relationships that exist between members of Congress and local  media and their
              effects on local media coverage.  Content  analysis of the stories pertaining
              to Congress or its members in  three types of local media across a variety of
              media markets  during election and nonelection years will show what is reported
               and how it is framed.  Interviews wil congressional press  secretaries and
              local reporters and editors will reveal the  member-media interaction, which in
              conjunction with news values  and news gathering processes will be used to
              explain the content  of local media coverage of Congress.    By allowing
              comparison of coverage across media types and markets  and between non election
              and election-year coverage, this project  is designed to fill major gaps in the
              literature on Congress and  the media.  The findings will have significant
              implications for  political participation and political communication, showing 
              whether or not local media provide the kind of information that  citizens need
              to hold their members of Congress accountable and  to participate effectively
              in democracy and the circumstances in  which local media are an effective means
              for members of Congress  to communicate with their constituents.
