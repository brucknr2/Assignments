Abstract    :
              9409805  Wang  Magnetic disk drives are the dominant mass storage devices for
              computers.  In order to meet the storage demand for image processing, massively
              parallel computing and multimedia, the areal recording densities of the disk
              drives need to be raised from currently 200 Megabits/inch2 to beyond 10
              Gigabits/inch2, an increase of about two orders of magnitude.  To reach this
              goal, a key technology for designing and fabricating high moment, submicron
              trackwidth, magnetic write heads are required to record digital bits with a
              size of about 0.1 um x 0.5 um on high coercivity magnetic disks which cannot be
              recorded with conventional Pemalloy magnetic heads.      The objectives and
              methods of the project are as follows;  1) Grow giant moment a" phase Fe16N2
              films on ceramic substrates by reactively sputtering and Fe target in Ar + N2 +
              NH3 plasma, with controlled in-situ substrate temperatures.  The effects of
              growth parameters and substrates on the phases, microstructures, and magnetic
              properties of the films obtained will be explored.  2) Fabricate magnetic write
              heads with the new material, and with a trackwidth < 0.5 um.  Electron-beam
              lithography and reactive ion beam etching will be used to fabricate submicron
              magnetic structures.  3) Investigate magnetic domain structures of such heads
              with magnetic force microscopy (MFM) and scanning electron microscopy with spin
              analysis (SEMPA).  Recording performance will be evaluated with industrial
              collaboration.  ***
