Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT     Babcock, Linda C.  Carnegie-Mellon University  SBR-9409723    The
              PI proposes to investigate the role of uncertainty in causing self-serving
              biases which lead, in turn, to bargaining impasses.  In the proposed study both
              field data and experimental manipulations will be used to investigate this
              issue.  First, educators will be surveyed concerning their reservation values
              in a hypothetical labor dispute.  Ambiguity will be manipulated by varying the
              range of salaries of other school districts.  Second, teachers will be asked in
              the survey what is the geographical area they use in deciding which neighboring
              school districts are proper bases of comparison for salary determinations. A
              geographic information system  and archival data will be used to investigate
              the relation between the characteristics of these comparison districts and
              teacher negotiation behavior.  The general hypothesis in this investigation is
              that ambiguity, defined as variance in comparison group salaries, leads to
              fewer successfully negotiated settlements.
