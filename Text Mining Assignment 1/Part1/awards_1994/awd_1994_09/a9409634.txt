Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is develop economic models for  analyzing the design
              of securities, considering the roles of  market liquidity, security ratings,
              credit enhancement, and the  distribution of information across investor
              groups.  Among the  questions to be addressed are: What is the role of security
               rating agencies in mitigating the costs of illiquidity, and how  is security
              design affected by that role?  Is there a useful role  for rating agencies
              beyond the traditional role of evaluating  default risk?  Do informational
              asymmetries and other  distinctions among investor groups cause clientele
              effects in  security design?  The results of this project are intended to 
              further our understanding of how security market innovation and  rating are
              affected by information held asymmetrically among  issuers, underwriters,
              broker-dealers, and groups of investors.   The project may also include results
              that in will assist security  issuers, underwriters and rating agencies in the
              efficient  conduct of their businesses.  In addition, the research may also 
              uncover welfare implications that will be useful to decision-  makers in
              formulating regulations regarding the use of security  ratings.
