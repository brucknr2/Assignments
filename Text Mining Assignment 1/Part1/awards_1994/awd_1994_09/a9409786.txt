Abstract    :
                      A study of mass transfer effects in extraction with supercritical fluids
              will be undertaken.  Rates of adsorption and desorption as well as equilibrium
              states are to be determined with a high pressure gravimetric device.   
              Supercritical fluid extraction holds promise as an environmentally friendly
              approach to the recovery of important chemical species.  This project will
              provide important data for the design and economic evaluation of prospective
              processes.
