Abstract    :
                A real-time system has specific time constraints for the processing  of
              database query as well as consistency requirements for its  temporal data.  If
              it is not possible to produce an exact answer to  a database query by a
              specified deadline, approximate query  processing can be used to provide an
              approximate answer within the  time constraints, but it does not address the
              temporal dimension of  the data.  This project integrates the two areas of
              approximate  query processing and temporal data in order to examine the 
              performance of approximate query processing for a real-time  database.  An
              analysis of the overhead required for the semantic  support of approximate
              query processing determines the design of  the approximate query processing
              system.  A performance analysis  demonstrates how well the system satisfies the
              timing constraints  of the queries and maintains the temporal consistency
              requirements  of the data in its approximate answers.  The result of this
              project  provides an approximate query processing system that is applicable  in
              real-time environments where data consistency must be maintained  an deadlines
              must be met.
