Abstract    :
                  When an animal moves around in its environment, the movement itself
              generates stimuli that can affect all the sensory systems.  It is important for
              an animal to have some kind of adaptive mechanism to minimize this
              self-generated noise that can interfere with detecting important sensory
              signals in the external environment.  This project uses the electrosensory
              system of an elasmobranch fish, the skate, to analyze the neural circuits in
              the brain that provide such mechanisms.  Intracellular electrophysiological
              recording with dye labeling allows identification of relevant nerve cell
              responses during self-generated versus external stimuli.  The mechanism for
              producing a differential cancellation of common input is explored by testing
              the role of known inhibitory transmitters on the cells involved.  A novel
              approach here uses a weak external electrical signal in the water that is
              directly coupled to the timing of fin movement, which itself creates a signal
              detected by the electrosensory system.   This paradigm allows direct tests for
              whether the adaptive filter mechanism works by an active process.  Results will
              add an important comparative dimension to our understanding of electrosensory
              systems, and will have implications for issues of brain control of movement and
              sensation, which are fundamental for all neuroscience, with added relevance to
              robotics and artificial neural systems.
