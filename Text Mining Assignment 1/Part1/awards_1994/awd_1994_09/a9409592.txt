Abstract    :
              9409592  NAGIN  This project aims to advance developmental theories of crime and
               deviance by examining the life course of different groups of  offenders.  The
              theories offer different explanations of the  evolution of antisocial behaviors
              from childhood through  adulthood.  One purpose of this project is to test the 
              proposition that some individuals are at greatly elevated risk of  continuing
              antisocial behavior.  The research will identify the  distinguishing
              characteristics of such individuals and measure  the impact of events later in
              life that appear to cause decreases  in criminal behavior for some individuals
              and increases for  others.  This analysis will allow the principal investigator
              to  determine which theoretical explanation best fits these findings.    The
              analysis will be conducted on three important data sets:  (1)  the classic
              matched sample of delinquent boys assembled by the  Gluecks (Boston area,
              subjects born in the 1920's), (2) the  National Youth Survey (U.S. probability
              sample of 11 to 17 year-  olds in 1976), and (3) the Dunedin, New Zealand
              survey of a 1972-  73 birth cohort.  The use of these three widely differing
              data  sets will allow the principal investigator to determine the  generality
              of the findings, thereby enhancing the theoretical  significance of this
              research.  ***
