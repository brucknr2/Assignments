Abstract    :
              9409496  Plank  The main goal of this project is the evaluate several techniques
               for providing efficient check-pointing in parallel processing  systems.
              Check-pointing is the act of saving the execution state  of a program with the
              purpose of restoring the system to a stable  state after a failure. The major
              obstacle to providing general  purpose fault-tolerance for parallel programs is
              the overhead  incurred by check-pointing. In an attempt to improve the 
              performance of check-pointing, this project explores diskless  check-pointing,
              user controlled check-pointing and meshing of  check-pointing with
              log-structured file systems. The impact of  these approaches and their
              subsequent implementations will be  investigated.  ***
