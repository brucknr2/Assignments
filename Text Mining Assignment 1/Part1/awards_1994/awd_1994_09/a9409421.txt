Abstract    :
              9409421  Rabelo       The objective of this project is to develop and bring to  
               engineering students and industry personnel a program for utilizing 
              artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for scheduling and   sequencing of
              manufacturing systems.  The materials to be packaged  for deployment purposes
              are the results and outcomes of prior   research efforts by the principal
              investigator (PI) in the same   subject area.  The program will involve the
              development of a series  of teaching/learning modules.  The PI, along with a
              team of  graduates students, consultants, academia and government personnel, 
              and production and systems managers will be engaged in the  development.  The
              development of the series will be based on  multimedia approach and is expected
              to provide a rich learning   experience and promote better learning experiences
              and  understanding.        The modules to be developed will be incorporated
              into    introductory manufacturing and control courses, applied AI courses, 
              and training and re-training seminars for production and research   and
              development personnel in industry.  Ideas will be solicited  from professors at
              different universities to build, update, and  modify the modules to ensure wide
              acceptance.
