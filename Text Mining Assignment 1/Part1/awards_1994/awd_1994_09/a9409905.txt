Abstract    :
              This research is on the design of test pattern generators for  combinational
              circuits.  Various schemes for LSFR/SR pseudorandom  test pattern generators
              are being examined.  The focus is on  finding high quality ATPG algorithms that
              require minimal hardware  overhead.  Several families of not-necessarily
              primitive,  characteristic polynomials are being investigated with the 
              objective of guaranteeing that test patterns will be applied  randomly to all
              outputs.  In addition, various partial scan schemes  that follow the structural
              approach are being studied.
