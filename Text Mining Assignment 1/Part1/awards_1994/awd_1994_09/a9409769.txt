Abstract    :
              In many database applications, especially scientific ones, the order among data
              items plays an important role. To query such sequenced data, current systems
              depend on recursion or iteration constructs found in programming languages.
              Although powerful enough to express all computable queries, these constructs
              are unnatural in expressing many intuitive queries and difficult to optimize.
              This research focuses on overcoming such drawbacks by studying and developing
              declarative query languages on sequenced data. The starting point is the query
              languages formerly defined by the principal investigator. Two other declarative
              query languages, using first-order logic on finite automata and temporal logic,
              are explored. The expressiveness of sequence queries is investigated by
              comparing these different languages and their variations. This expressiveness
              study is extended by using computational complexity classes. Another part of
              the research is to investigate optimization techniques for sequence queries,
              with emphasis on transforming queries into equivalent but more efficient forms.
              Experimental work is to be performed to test proposed query formation and
              optimization. The results obtained by the research will lead to a better
              understanding of declarative sequence queries, and provide crucial components
              for database applications that demand easy-to-use and efficient query languages
              on sequenced data.
