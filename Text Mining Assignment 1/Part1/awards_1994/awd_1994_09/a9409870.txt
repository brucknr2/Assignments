Abstract    :
              9409870  Chajes, Michael J.    This is a Research Initiation Award.  This
              research involves  utilizing the unique properties of composite materials, in 
              combination with engineered wood and concrete, to develop a new,  economical,
              high-strength structural member for use in bridges  and buildings.    The
              research will involve the development, testing, and  evaluation of
              concrete-wood-FRP composite beams.  the important  issues to be addressed are: 
              (1) bond strength between the FRP  plates and engineered wood, (2) composite
              action between and  concrete flange and wood web, (3) stiffness, ultimate
              strength,  and ductility of the composite beams, and (4) behavior of the 
              composite beams under sustained loads.    The investigation will lead to the
              development of versatile, high-  strength, composite beams and to basic
              research findings relevant  to the use of advanced composite materials for
              structural  engineering applications.  ***
