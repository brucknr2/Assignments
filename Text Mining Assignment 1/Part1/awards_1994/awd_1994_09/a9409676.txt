Abstract    :
              9409676  Lesieutre       The project aims to develop a systematic,
              mathematically  rigorous method for the construction of physically-based
              dynamic  load models.  These models will increase the accuracy of power 
              systems studies and improve power system operations by enabling  more accurate
              calculation of steady-state and dynamic response.         A model capturing the
              physical characteristics of an  induction motor will be constructed and then
              used to identify  which load model, among the widely varying models that appear
              in  the literature, is most suitable for voltage stability studies.  
              Steady-state and transient stability studies will be performed to  examine the
              effect of the load.  Following this example and using  knowledge of significant
              load components, the researchers will  construct a general model taking into
              account the composition of  the load.  The aggregation of dissimilar components
              and the  representation of the model in terms of meaningful power system 
              variables will be accomplished through a series of nonlinear  transformations. 
              The resulting model will retain the critical  dynamic characteristics of the
              individual load components.  ***
