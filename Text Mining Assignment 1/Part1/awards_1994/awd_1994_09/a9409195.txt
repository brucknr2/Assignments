Abstract    :
              9409195  Fiebig       Research in theoretical particle physics will involve  the
              use of numerical simulations of lattice field theory to  study aspects of the
              strong nuclear force between nuclei and  mesons. Two models are examined in
              detail.  The first is a  formulation of quantum electrodynamics (the theory
              that  describes the interaction between electrons and light) in  three
              dimensional space-time.  The second utilizes the  results of the study of the
              first in formulating a similar  analysis of quantum chromodynamics (the theory
              of the strong  nuclear force) in four dimensional space-time.  The results  of
              the research will enhance our understanding of the forces  among the
              constituents of atomic nuclei.    ***
