Abstract    :
              9409768  Calomiris  This research will address two issues involving the banking 
              system during the Great Depression. First, it will examine  the role of the
              Reconstruction Finance Corporation in the  recovery of the banking system
              during the Great Depression.  Second, it will examine the extent to which
              interbank  externalities played a major role in the crisis. The theory  that
              banks that were in trouble withdrew funds from  healthier banks thus
              perpetuating a liquidity crisis in the  other banks, is referred to as the
              "contagion effect". The  empirical research will use data for  banks across the
               United States for the period 1930 to 1933.       This project is of timely
              interest because it addresses  the role of federal assistance in the banking
              system. The  study should offer important new insights into the sources  of
              banking failures during the Great Depression. The results  would also shed some
              light on the effects of federal  assistance on bank performance during the
              Depression.
