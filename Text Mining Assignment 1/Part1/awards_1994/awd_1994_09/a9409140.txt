Abstract    :
              The PI proposes to develop a comprehensive model for thermal plasma arcs while
              including flow and heat transfer to particles.  A full 2-dimensional simulation
              of the plasma on a macroscopic level will be developed while a separate but
              linked microscopic model of the particles will be attempted.  The PI claims
              that "New Science" involving the details of the microscopic model for the
              particles will be developed.  This will include the consideration of
              non-spherical particles and a Lagrangian formulation of the governing
              equations.  Sophisticated gridding techniques will be used for the particle
              interactions.
