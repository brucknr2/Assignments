Abstract    :
              ECS-9409111  Plummer  The proposed National Nanofabrication Network initially
              will consist of two hub facilities on the east and west coasts at Cornell
              University and Stanford University, growing from the existing NNF and the
              Center for Integrated Systems (CIS) laboratories.  Three additional nodes will
              offer critical masses of expertise in fabrication with particular emphasis in
              specific areas:  wide band gap semiconductors, novel materials and
              semiconductor etching at Howard University, the Pennsylvania State University
              and the University of California at Santa Barbara respectively.  Mechanisms are
              proposed for future expansion of the capabilities of the network by the
              affiliation of a greater number of university, government and industrial
              laboratories.  The proposed N3, which has as its core the above five major
              universities, will provide to the US research community a new dimension in
              fabrication capabilities.  The network will lead as a provider of services, as
              a knowledge resource, and as a source of instruction to the community.  By
              providing access to the most advanced materials nanofabrication processes and
              expertise, the capabilities of a diverse and growing body of researchers
              throughout the nation will be dramatically enhanced.  ***
