Abstract    :
              9409921  Bettencourt                              ABSTRACT         Several
              hypotheses regarding the extremity of judging  members of ingroups and
              outgroups are derived from a  comprehensive analysis of the existing and
              contradictory research  literature on polarization effects. The proposed
              research focuses  on generating stimulus materials and pilot data that will
              permit  the PI to test three hypotheses in a subsequent grant  application: 1)
              the 'complexity-extremity' hypothesis that  outgroup members will be evaluated
              more extremely because  perceivers have lower cognitive complexity regarding
              out-groups  than in-groups; 2) the 'black sheep' hypothesis that extreme 
              members of ingroups (both good and bad) are evaluated more  extremely than
              equivalently good or bad outgroup members; 3) the  'expectancy violation'
              hypothesis that ingroup and outgroup  members will be evaluated more extremely
              to the extent that their  behavior violates perceivers' expectancies.       
              The research is important because it promises to provide new  insights into the
              question of why people evaluate the same  behavior differently when it is
              performed by a member of their  ingroup than when it is performed by a member
              of another group.   This phenomenon has implications for discriminatory
              treatment in  academic settings, work settings, the courtroom.  By increasing 
              our understanding of the nature of these prejudicial effects and  the
              psychological processes underlying them, the present research  will place us in
              a better position to reduce them.   ***
