Abstract    :
              The aim of the project is to develop a new methodology for  prototyping and
              designing land-grid-array connectors for multichip  modules in high performance
              computers.  An optimal design procedure  to study the effects of several
              parameters on the connectors is a  part of the investigation.  A design
              verification procedure using  scaled-up prototypes of LGA connector contacts
              through experimental  models is also proposed.
