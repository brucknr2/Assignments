Abstract    :
              9409302  Dekel    This project focuses on three research topics: (1) 
              Experiments  and or mutations are an important ingredient in the models used 
              in the recent research on learning and evolution in economics.   The proposal
              develops models where rates of experimentation are  themselves learned or
              mimicked and then explores how different  aspects of the environment influence
              the rate of experimentation  that arises in the long run.  (2) Models where the
              possible  information received by an individual does not partition the set  of
              states of the world have been used to introduce various  elements of bounded
              rationality into decision making and game  theory.  However, these models
              implicitly assume that players are  unaware of their information sets, while
              the applications in  games often implicitly assume that the information
              structure is  common knowledge.  The research explores this apparent conflict 
              by explicitly developing a dynamic process of how players use  their
              information.  A related objective is to develop an explicit  model of
              forgetfulness to see how it corresponds to the general  models without
              partitions.  (3)  Models of herds, or  informational cascades, where buyers
              mimic preceding buyers  rather than using their own private information ignore
              the fact  that sellers have strong incentives to entice buyers to create a 
              herd/cascade for their own product.  The research will explore  the extent to
              which this can happen, what types of sellers will  invest in falsely creating
              herds/cascades, and whether more or  less information is used when sellers are
              activity trying to  create herds/cascades.
