Abstract    :
              9409300  Aldrich    This Doctoral dissertation Research Support project examines
               congressional oversight of federal bureaucratic agencies.  It  aims to answer
              several questions, including:  To what extent do  members of Congress engage in
              supervision of bureaucratic  behavior themselves, as opposed to delegating
              oversight authority  to interest groups affected by agency decisions?  How
              effective  are various forms of oversight in constraining agency discretion?  
              The project's central hypothesis is that political influence on  bureaucratic
              behavior is most prevalent and effective not through  formal mechanisms such as
              congressional subcommittee hearings,  but through informal channels such as
              meetings between  bureaucrats and interest groups affected by agency rules.   
              The project tests this theoretical proposition by focusing on a  major health
              care issue:  payments by the Medicare program to  physicians treating Medicate
              patients.  In 1989, Congress  mandated the development of a fee schedule, a
              payment mechanism  which prospectively sets the amounts that Medicate pays for
              all  physician services.  Through a series of regression equations,  this
              project assesses the impact of various types of formal and  informal oversight
              on the setting of payment levels.  These  results are significant in that they
              represent one of the first  empirical examinations of congressional oversight
              and provide  insight into the politics of health care reform.
