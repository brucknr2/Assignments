Abstract    :
                9409506  King       The goal of the projected research is to develop rigorous 
              theoretical and computational methods for optimal sensor and  actuator design.
              The investigation will concentrate on systems  governed by partial differential
              equations (PDEs). Many feedback  control design methods yield a solution (i.e.,
              an optimal  control) which is written in terms of a feedback operator and the 
              optimal state. For finite dimensional systems, this control can  also be
              written as a product of gains and states and decisions  regarding sensor design
              can be made using the form of the gains.  In many PDE control problems, the
              gain operator is a bounded  linear transformation between Hilbert spaces.
              Representation  theorems often can be applied to obtain an Rintegral 
              representationS of the gain operator that provides the basis for  numerical
              approximations and analysis.      Initially, the investigator will consider the
              problem of  finding the optimal gain operator without prior assumptions 
              regarding actuator type. Robust control designs will be used to  formulate the
              corresponding sensor design problem. The optimal  sensors/actuators for the PDE
              systems may be spatially  distributed, though one may wish to approximate the
              optimal  designs and implement a finite number of sensors and actuators.  This
              requires approximation theorems for the various types of  control operators.
