Abstract    :
              This research is on developing strategies and methods to generate  high quality
              tests for all faults that might affect the performance  of a circuit.  In the
              case where a fault may affect a circuit's  performance, under any timing
              defect, a test under the most  stringent condition for which the fault is
              testable must be done.   To this end, three topics are being investigated. 
              First, new  testability conditions are being formulated for faults that are not
               testable under all existing conditions, and test generation methods  for such
              faults are being investigated.  Second, methods for  automatic generation of
              validatable, non-robust tests of the  highest quality are being developed. 
              Third, methods for generating  non-robust tests with high robustness are being
              explored.
