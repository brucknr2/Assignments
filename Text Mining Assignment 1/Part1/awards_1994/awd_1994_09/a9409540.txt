Abstract    :
              Statistics and econometrics are mainly concerned with the quantitative
              measurement and analysis of real world phenomena.  Typically, it is assumed
              that the data for the variables of interest are available and are measured
              accurately.  In reality, errors of measurement are common because of reporting
              errors or because behavioral responses are in part determined by unobserved
              characteristics of agents; thus the variables of interest are latent or
              unobservable.  This project is concerned with developing an analytical
              framework to extract information from data that is subject to either random or
              systematic measurement errors.  The objective is to refine the methodology to
              establish empirically valid inferences from imperfectly measured data.  In
              particular, we shall study issues of (i) random measurement errors in time
              series data that contain (stochastic) trends; (ii) systematic errors due to
              biased or exaggerated responses of sample respondents or grouping of individual
              observations into categories for the sake of confidentiality or convenience of
              collecting data; (iii) extracting information on the implicit market for
              characteristics (or attributes) from the "hedonic" approach developed by
              economists to simplify the analysis of differentiated products and quality
              changes over time; and (iv) modeling unobserved individual characteristics in
              panel data analysis which directs its focus on individual outcomes.
