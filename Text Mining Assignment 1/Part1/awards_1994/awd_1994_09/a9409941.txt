Abstract    :
              9409941  Kroll       The goal of this project is to develop a manual procedure
              for   generating assembly sequences of products to be used in conjunction  
              with teaching concurrent design to undergraduate and graduate   mechanical
              engineering students.  The developed procedure will be   based on two research
              projects in computerized design for assembly   and assembly planning, and will
              be adapted for manual use.  The   assembly planning method will be tested in a
              senior-level   undergraduate design class and a graduate elective course.   
              Participating students will be able to take with them to industry   the learned
              methodology and written materials in the form of   handouts and laboratory
              notes.       Concurrent design of product and processes has resulted in  
              significant cost savings in industry.  Yet, methods for teaching   these
              subjects in engineering schools fall short in providing both   a comprehensive
              approach to the problem and a systematic design   procedure.  This project
              focuses on the assembly planning aspect of   concurrent product design, with
              the premise that product structure   and configuration are more important than
              minute part details.
