Abstract    :
              9409952  Yankova    This planning activity includes preliminary experiments and 
              theoretical modeling, which facilitate a development of a  subsequent full
              scale research proposal on interface response in  binary alloys.  A basic
              experimental and theoretical research  project examines interface response in
              model cadmium-zinc alloys in  order to understand mass transfer and
              microstructural development  during rapid solidification of laser melted pools
              of binary alloys.   The research applies the Aziz-Kaplan interface response
              functions,  combined with a method for determining Vo/Vd (the ratio of the 
              maximum speed of crystal growth at infinite driving force to the  maximum speed
              of inter-diffusion at infinite driving force) to  study far from equilibrium
              materials processing.    %%%  An understanding of interface response offers the
              potential not  only for producing novel microstructures with enhanced
              properties  in metallic, ceramic and semiconductor systems, but also for fully 
              exploiting rapid spinning and gas atomization techniques for  processing of new
              metal alloys.      ***
