Abstract    :
              9409444  Jackson  This research effort will investigate the application of
              conjugated polymer thin film transistors to direct-view active matrix liquid
              crystal displays.  This work will begin with the synthesis and analysis of
              several a-polythiophenes and concentrate initially on a-sexithienylene (a-6T). 
              Next, appropriate techniques will be developed for high vacuum deposition of
              thin films of these materials onto organic and inorganic substrates.  Emphasis
              will be placed on controlled deposition and on maximizing the crystallinity of
              the resulting thin films. Finally, thin film transistors will be fabricated and
              used to evaluate the quality of deposited films and materials and evaluate the
              suitability of these devices for use in direct view active matrix liquid
              crystal display applications.  ***
