Abstract    :
              9409666  Vin  Recent advances in computing, networking, and storage 
              technologies promise to create an infrastructure in which  computer systems
              will support a wide range of multimedia  services through interactive
              multimedia servers distributed  over highspeed networks.  The main objective of
              the research  is to synthesize cost-effective system architectures for 
              designing such multimedia servers by developing:  (1)  efficient disk
              scheduling algorithms which minimize the  average access time to media blocks
              from disk, (2) novel  admission control algorithms that a multimedia server can
               employ to maximize the number of clients being serviced  simultaneously while
              assuring the quality of service  requirements of none of the clients are
              violated, and (3)  algorithms for efficient placement (including replication 
              and distribution as desirable) of multiresolution multimedia  objects of disk
              arrays.  Algorithms and protocols that are  found to be promising will be
              implemented and evaluated in a  prototype distributed multimedia storage
              server. ***
