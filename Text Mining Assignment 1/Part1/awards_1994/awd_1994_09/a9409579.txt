              SUMMARY OF PANEL DISCUSSION    Proposal Number:  CTS-9409579  P.I.:  Saundra M.
              Trioan  Institution:  Princeton University     Dr. Troian proposes a
              theoretical and experimental investigation of novel fingering instabilities in
              Marangoni-type spreading of liquid drops on thin films of higher surface
              tension.  Emphasizing surfactant solutions near the critical micel
              concentration, theory will reduce the film depression at the base of radially
              spreading drops and vertical diffusive transport of soluble surfactants, with
              the drop acting as a reservoir.  Seeks to determine the dominant through
              analysis of competition of stabilities and destabilizing effects.  Experimental
              flow visualization is based on image processing.   Pauley strongly supports
              identification and insightful analysis of important new elements of a problem
              that has old origins.  Excellent work by PI with excellent background. 
              Potential applications well motivated; but some of them a bit removed from
              engineering, or else it is not clear that the pertinent Marangoni instability
              is dominant or major effect (e.g., droplet inhalation- very complex).  well
              written proposal covers insightful asymptotic theory and experiments.   Some
              concern that appropriate collaborator for theory is at post doctoral level, and
              not in realm of graduate {SYMBOL 222 \f "Symbol"} Ph.D. education - made as a
              general comment.  But area is definitely ripe for training chemical engineers
              in very sound fundamentals.   Overall, impressive physics.
