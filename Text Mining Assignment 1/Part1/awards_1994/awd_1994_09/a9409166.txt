Abstract    :
              9409166  Wei       The investigator study the effect of curvature bounds on the 
              local geometric  structure and global topology of a Riemannian  manifold. In
              the compact case, this includes the question of the  structure of the
              fundamental group of a near elliptic manifold.  For open manifolds, the
              investigator are concentrating on the  structures of manifolds with nonnegative
              Ricci curvature,  especially the question when they will have finite
              topological  type.  ***
