Abstract    :
              9409090  Rosenthal  This research will focus on three related topics. In the 
              first project, game-thoeretic models are developed which  focus on incentive
              schemes to implement desirable public  good allocations in situations where
              information is  incomplete for some social groups. In the second project, 
              models are developed which deal with the interacting  dynamics between two
              social groups. The goal is to explore  under what conditions would  opportunism
              drives out  cooperation if individual members of one group behave in an 
              opportunistic manner against the individuals of the other  group. The third
              project develops models of communication  and coordination. The aim is to
              assess the effects of lags  in the flow of economic information across groups
              in the  absence of market price signals.       The study is of significant
              interest because it would  enrich our understanding of how society is organized
              and the  different ways individual behavior respond to that  organization.
