Abstract    :
              9409900  Mollendorf  The proposed research is in the Undergraduate Design
              Projects  Program category, and requests support for undergraduate and 
              graduate student engineers to provide prototype "custom designed"  devices and
              software to aid persons with disabilities.  The  primary goal of this thrust is
              to provide meaningful design  experience for the engineering student that will
              directly aid a  specific disabled individual. A formal program is in place at 
              SUNY Buffalo which will ensure satisfactory progress is attained  on these
              projects.  A group of students and the investigators on  the grant will work
              with a number of collaborating agencies and  individuals on these projects.
              Sixty projects are planned during  the five year duration of this award, and a
              written report on the  completed projects will be submitted for an annual
              publication.  Once completed, each project will be given to the person for whom
               it is designed.  The hope is that this "real world" experience  will give
              engineering students a sense of purpose and pride, help  engineering schools
              serve the community, attract new students  into engineering, and raise student
              interest in graduate  education.    This type of undertaking is important since
              it provides a  meaningful experience for engineering students as part of their 
              undergraduate design requirements, and will also benefit a  population where
              customization is often needed for rehabilitation  device.  ***
