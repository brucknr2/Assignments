Abstract    :
              9409715  Feron  The two most useful properties of a good control system design 
              are robustness and performance.  Performance is the ability for a  control
              system to  satisfy a number of specifications, usually  based on some inputs
              and outputs.  Robustness is the property  that a system perform well even in
              the presence of uncertainties.                                              
              This research will develop a method that combines the theory of  stability
              multipliers with numerical convex optimization to  handle the problem of robust
              performance for control systems  analysis and synthesis.  Preliminary
              investigations suggest that  this technique should perform considerably better
              than existing  analysis and synthesis methods for robust control by solving a 
              much wider class of problems.  The use of interior-point  optimization
              techniques combined with the newly developed concept  of Linear Matrix
              Inequality may lead to small amounts of  computations, especially suitable for
              fast, interactive design  tools.  ***
