Abstract    :
              9409205  Smith    The objective of this research is to identify the  fundamental
              physical parameters which determine the atomic  structure of thin
              transition-metal films deposited on  aluminum single crystal surfaces.  The
              experiments are  designed to characterize the early stages of epitaxial  growth
              and compound formation in the limit of very thin  overlayers.  The selected
              transition metals (titanium,  nickel, iron, cobalt and chromium) span a range
              of values  for the mismatch in  substrate/overlayer lattice structure  and for
              the chemical formation energy of the transition-  metal aluminide. The research
              focuses on those systems which  appear promising for growing epitaxial
              structures.  The  measurements characterize the degree of ordered growth or 
              substrate disruption at the interface using high-energy ion  backscattering and
              channeling, low  energy electron  diffraction, and x-ray photoelectron
              diffraction.  Core-  level binding energies measured with x-ray photoemission 
              serves to identify compound formation at the interfaces.  Monte Carlo computer
              simulations, using the Embedded Atom  Method for calculating total energies, is
              used as a guide in  the structure analysis.  Research results will provide a 
              better understanding of and ability to predict atomic  structure at metal/metal
              interfaces.  %%%  Understanding and controlling the atomic structure of 
              supported thin films of iron, cobalt and chromium is  important for tailoring
              the magnetic properties of these  films.  The thermal stability and lattice
              matching  characteristics of several of these aluminides make them  excellent
              candidates for epitaxial metallization on III-V  semiconductors, such as
              gallium  arsenide and Indium  Phosphide (InP).  ***
