Abstract    :
              9409743  Thompson       This career advancement award supports mathematical
              research  on problems arising in the fields of knot theory, minimal surface 
              theory and the theory of 3-manifolds.  The emphasis of this  project is to
              explore an area at the border between  low-dimensional topology and geometry
              via the concept of thin  position.  In knot theory, this concept was first
              introduced by  D. Gabai and used to solve the long-standing property R 
              conjecture.  The analog to thin position in minimal surface  theory has been
              studied extensively the H. Rubenstein; in  particular, thin position proved to
              be the key to the solution to  the recognition problem for the 3-sphere.  The
              knot theoretic  interpretation of thin position has recently been used to give
              an  alternate proof of Rubenstein's theorem, confirming close  connections
              between the two points of view.  Pursuit of such  linkage between two different
              areas promises to be extremely  fruitful.  The goals of this project are
              twofold; first, to  acquire a deep understanding of minimal surface theory, 
              particularly PL-minimal surface theory.  Second, to exploit thin  position,
              with the intent of using insights from knot theory to  solve interesting
              questions in minimal surface theory and  vice-versa.  ***
