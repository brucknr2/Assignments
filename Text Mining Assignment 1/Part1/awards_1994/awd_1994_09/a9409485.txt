Abstract    :
              Project Summary  Lummerzheim/ATM-9409485         This project will develop a
              model that can self-consistently  explain the formation of auroral rays.  Rays
              frequently sprout  above auroral arcs, extending upwards from the arc at
              regularly  spaced intervals.  The PIs will develop a model that attributes the 
              generation of rays to collisions of locally accelerated electrons  with the
              neutral gas.  The model will contain a parallel electric  field resulting from
              a tearing mode instability, the relevant  ionospheric chemistry, and particle
              transport in a self-consistent  formulation.  Predictions will be made about
              the dynamics,  brightness, spatial distribution, and temporal evolution of rays
               that can be tested by observations.
