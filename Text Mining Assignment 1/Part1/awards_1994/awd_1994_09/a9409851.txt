Abstract    :
                    IRI-9409851  Silsbee, Peter  Old Dominion University  $32,641 - 12 mos.

              Total Award $34,141)      RIA: "Computer Lipreading for Robust Automatic Speech
              Recognition"    This is the first year of a three-year continuing RIA Award to 
              investigate four areas:  1) how to advance the state of the art in 
              computerized lipreading, 2) how to integrate the acoustic and  visual
              information acquired by the computer, 3) how to develop a  database of natural
              speech for use in lipreading research, and  4) to demonstrate that audiovisual
              automatic speech recognition  (ASR) is more robust than recognition using the
              acoustic signal  only.  The project database includes multiple speakers and
              uses  three-dimensional deformable models.  The integration of the visual  and
              acoustic signal considers the adaptation of the speech signal,  the acoustic
              environment, and the quality of the visual  information.
