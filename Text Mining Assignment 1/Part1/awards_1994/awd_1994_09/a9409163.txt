Abstract    :
              9409163  Gruzglina   This award is for research to develop a theory of the
              compaction process for powder materials, based on the concept of modeling the
              compacted blend as a viscous fluid.  An analysis of the formation of
              asymmetrical briquettes using conventional forming elements will be conducted. 
              The process of counter-motion of the blend in the pressing zone will be
              studied.  New improved forming elements will be developed.  Thus, the research
              is directed at replacing current empirical design methods for compacting
              machinery by an analytical approach, based on the proposed theory.  
              Briquetting machinery is widely used in powder metallurgy, nonferrous
              metallurgy, coal production, and production of food and pharmaceutical
              products.  The results of the research will therefore be of potential use in
              all these industries.
