Abstract    :
              9409559  Baron    This research program has four parts. The first part of the 
              study involves a more complete exploration of information  hierarchies.
              Information hierarchies include public  hierarchies, such as, Congress, bureau,
              state agency, etc.  and private hierarchies, such as, manager, foreman, 
              headquarters, etc. The model that is developed addresses  current debates about
              the delegation of authority. It looks  at the problem of contracting and
              subcontracting when  information is incomplete and unobservable to at least one
               of the parties involved.   The second part of the study  involves the
              development of collective choice theory from a  sequential choice perspective.
              It focuses on the provision  of collective goods rather than particularistic
              goods. It  attempts to include the electorate in the model and  addresses
              questions concerning the amount of information the  electorate has about
              collective goods programs. The third  part of the study deals with interest
              groups and their  influence at the electoral and legislative stages of the 
              policy process. The fourth part of the study involves  empirical tests of the
              sequential choice models of  collective goods provision using data on
              entitlement  expenditures.       This project is of significant interest
              because it  attempts to develop further a relatively novel approach to 
              modeling political institutions, to integrate legislative  and electoral
              determinants of policies, and to provide  insights into the nature and
              evolution of entitlement  programs.
