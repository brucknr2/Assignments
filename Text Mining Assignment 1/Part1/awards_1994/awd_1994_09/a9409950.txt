Abstract    :
              9409950  Pantazidou    The objective of this research is to investigate the 
              migration potential of dense non aqueous phase liquid  (DNAPLs) in the
              subsurface by using centrifuge modeling.  The conditions under which the
              centrifuge simulates  satisfactorily the governing processes in multiphase flow
               transport will be established first by critically  reviewing and reconciling
              scaling laws developed by  employing  dimensional analysis and the method of
              modeling models.  The appropriateness of the scaling laws will be tested 
              against the results of a series of centrifuge model  experiments, consisting of
              NADPLs percolating in saturated  sand, silt, and clay.  The NADPL migration
              will be  monitored with visual methods, supplemented by electric  conductivity
              or receptivity measurements.  ***
