Abstract    :
              The objective of the project is to develop and validate a  biosphere model for
              arctic tundra that is linked to  satellite observations. Such models provide
              land-atmosphere  boundary forcing for atmospheric circulation models.  By 
              linking the biosphere model to satellite observations,  performance of the
              biosphere model over the Arctic Slope can  be monitored and an annual estimate
              of depth and moisture  content of the active layer with a spatial resolution of
              ~40  kmthe resolution of the 37 GHz channel of the Defense  Meteorological
              Satellite's Special Sensor Microwave/Imager  (SSM/I) should be possible.  The
              biosphere model will be an  adaptation of the National Center for Atmospheric
              Research's  Biosphere-Atmosphere Transfer Scheme (BATS) and will draw  heavily
              from our Michigan Cold Region Radiobrightness (MCRR)  model.  The MCRR model
              currently applies to prairie that is  subject to diurnal and annual freezing
              and thawing.  The new  biosphere model will be extrapolated from this project's
               field sites to the Arctic Slope in general through use of  SSM/I data and
              through cooperative observations with other  Arctic System Science projects. 
              This project is a  contribution to the Land/Atmosphere/Ice Interaction 
              component of the Arctic System Science (ARCSS) Program.
