Abstract    :
              With this Research Planning Grant for Women, the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and
              Organometallic  Chemistry Program supports preliminary research on the effect
              of protein environment on the  catalytic and redox activity of ferredoxins by
              Kristene K. Surerus of the Chemistry Department,  University of Wisconsin -
              Milwaukee.  The long-term goals of the project are to investigate the  role of
              hydrogen bonding in regulating oxidation-reduction potential of ferredoxins,
              and to  explore the relationship of ligand environment to catalytic behavior. 
              Mossbauer spectroscopy  will be used to observe changes in ferredoxin behavior.
               The research planning period will  enable Surerus to test the feasibility of
              the experimental design.  The findings have implications  for development of
              solid state catalysts or electronic materials.
