Abstract    :
              In this proposal research planning grant Dr. Mary Berry will explore the  
              dynamics of cross-relaxation up-conversion in bridged binuclear complexes   of
              lanthanide ions isolated in a molecular beam.  Several bridged   complexes will
              be studied to determine whether up-conversion in condensed   phases will
              actually occur and to investigate their suitability for   volatilization.  The
              apparatus used in these studies includes a molecular   beam instrument with
              heated nozzle sources as well as equipment for   performing ring-down
              spectroscopy and laser-induced fluorescence   experiments.  If successful,
              these experiments will provide a better   understanding of cross relaxation
              up-conversion than is obtained from   condensed phase studies.    In this
              project fairly large molecular entities called binuclear   complexes will be
              examined in an environment called a molecular beam.    Under these conditions
              each complex is isolated from other molecules, and   therefore the outcome of
              stimulating the complexes with light depends   only on the nature of these
              complexes, and not on the species in their   immediate surroundings. 
              Interpretation of the processes involved in   transferring energy gained from
              absorbing the light is simplified   relative to examining those processes in
              condensed phases, since   complications arising from interactions between the
              complexes and the   host crystal, for example, are eliminated.
