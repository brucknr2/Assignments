Abstract    :
                Carbon dioxide (CO2) has an effect on ventilation rate in animals, and some of
              the cellular mechanisms for that regulation are known.  In reptiles and
              amphibians, some of the olfactory receptor cells in the nose apparently are
              sensitive to CO2, but how these cells respond, and how they may contribute to
              controlling breathing remains unknown.  There is some evidence that the enzyme
              carbonic anhydrase is required to detect changes in CO2 in other systems.  This
              project addresses the role of carbonic anhydrase in detecting CO2 in the frog
              olfactory receptors.  The physiological response of the summed receptor
              potential of a population of olfactory cells in the epithelium is recorded
              before and after application of an inhibitor for carbonic anhydrase. 
              Histological experiments will determine the location of carbonic anhydrase
              contained in cells in the nasal epithelium, to correlate with the physiological
              data.  Results will increase our understanding of chemoreception and of
              ventilation control mechanisms, and so will have impact on general physiology
              as well as sensory neuroscience.
