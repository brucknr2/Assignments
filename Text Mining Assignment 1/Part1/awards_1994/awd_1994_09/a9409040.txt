Abstract    :
              9409040  Tauchen    It is quite common across many research areas in empirical 
              economics for there to be an accumulated body of knowledge  regarding the
              statistical characteristics of the relevant data.   This knowledge is acquired
              from the years of experience of many  investigators using statistical models to
              describe the data.  The  models are termed statistical because, with rare
              exceptions, the  parameters have no direct behavioral interpretation.  A
              structure  model, such as an equilibrium asset pricing model or an  equilibrium
              business cycle model, stands in sharp contract to a  statistical model.  A
              structural model typically provides a  complete description of the underlying
              dynamics, and many  parameters have behavioral interpretations.  Estimating a
              modern  stochastic structural model presents formidable computational and 
              statistical challenges.  A reasonable principle for structural  estimation is
              to bring to bear on the problem the accumulated  stock of knowledge regarding
              the reduced form statistical models  that have been found by others to work
              well.  The proposed  project undertakes extensions and refinements of new
              estimators  for dynamic models based on this principle.  The proposed work is 
              in two parts: a methodological section and an empirical section.   The
              methodological work entails development of reliable methods  for statistical
              inference, comparative work with other  estimators, and visualization work to
              learn more about the  dynamics embedded in the model and the characteristics of
              the  objective function of estimation.  The empirical work applies the  new
              estimators to address issues in asset pricing, financial  volatility, and
              empirical auction research.  The main research  tools are nonlinear estimation,
              Monte Carlo simulation, and the  AVS visualization package.  The results of the
              project will be of  interest to empirical economists and statisticians, and in 
              particular to researchers doing simulation work or to researchers  becoming
              interested in interactive v isualization of structural  models.
