Abstract    :
                9409788  Wang          In the applications of Markov chains, certain limiting 
              properties are often of interest, such as the convergence rate  and the
              behavior of the limiting distributions. The most general  condition of Markov
              chains related to the above properties is  associated with Harris recurrence,
              which requires the Markov  chain returning to every set of positive measure
              infinitely  often, with probability 1.  The properties of Harris recurrent 
              Markov chains are well studied.  However, there are examples of  common Markov
              chains (e.g., some simple auto-regressive models)  which are not Harris
              recurrent.  It appears that Harris  recurrence is a strong condition.  A.V.
              Skorokhod suggests  another type of recurrence --- topological recurrence.     
                 Topological recurrence requires the Markov chain returning  to every open
              set infinitely often with probability 1.  Topological recurrence is essentially
              weaker and more natural  than Harris recurrence.  Skorokhod's work should have
              impact in a  lot of applications. But so far, this result is still a 
              heoretical advance only.  Further understanding of topological  recurrence
              should give us insight into  the essence of  convergence of Markov chains.  The
              proposed work here is to make  a preliminary study of further applications of
              topological  recurrence.  ***
