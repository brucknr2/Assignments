Abstract    :
              9409471  Cheng  The objectives of this project are to improve existing
              hydrodynamic transport models, to develop efficient approaches to
              nonequilibrium/hot-electron energy/momentum distribution functions in
              single-and multi-valley bandstructures, to study the fundamental transport
              phenomena and limitations of device operation at small scales, to explore new
              device structures, and to improve device performance.  The approach is based on
              the concept of a "hydro-kinetic" distribution which is interpolated between the
              Boltzmann (kinetic) transport equation and hydro-dynamic equations.  The
              developed models can properly account for effects, which have never been
              successfully included in modeling high-speed semiconductor devices.  In
              addition, the efficient hydro-kinetic approach is useful of analysis of FET
              gate current, electron injection between heterojunctions, and device
              reliability, associated with hot-electron phenomena.  Success of this proposed
              project will result in a new understanding of these effects and will bring in
              new concepts and structures to improve device performance and reliability.  ***
