Abstract    :
              9409695  Yang  Efficient scheduling of computational task execution and  data
              movement is essential to high-performance computing on  massively parallel
              machines and workstation clusters.  This  research focuses on the study of
              graph scheduling algorithms  and the run-time schedule executing methods for
              mapping  program parallelism on message-passing architectures.  The  goal of
              optimization is to minimize the parallel time by  balancing load among a
              limited number of processors,  eliminating unnecessary communication and
              overlapping  computation with communication.    There exists two types of
              parallelism in a program, task  parallelism is expressed as a collection of
              functional tasks  with communication between them.  The dependence structure 
              is a directed acyclic graph (DAG).  Loop parallelism is  expressed as a
              collection of iterated computation with loop-  carried dependence. The main
              research topics identified in  this project are to develop scheduling
              algorithms for both  task and loop parallelism and run-time methods to execute 
              the scheduled graph, study the methods of loop  transformation to help graph
              scheduling algorithm to explore  more parallelism, apply these algorithms in
              scientific  computing such as sparse matrix factorization and iterative 
              methods, analyze the impact of program partitioning on  scheduling performance.
                 Research activities include developing and implementing  algorithms for the
              above problems and evaluating the  performance on parallel machines and
              workstation clusters,  integrating these algorithms in a scheduling tool and 
              distributing the implementation.  ***
