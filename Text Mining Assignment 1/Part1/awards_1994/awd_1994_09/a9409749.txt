Abstract    :
              William E. Ryan  RIA:  Signal Processing and Coding for High Density Magnetic 
              Recording Channels    In this project we first take a closer look at previously
              reported  results on the performance of error control codes on high density 
              magnetic recording channels (MRCs).  In particular, we derive  optimal code
              rates (in the sense of maximizing coding gain) and  then examine the gains
              afforded by optimal rate codes assuming both  infinite and finite decoding
              effort.  Previous work examined coding  gains of non-optimal rate codes
              assuming an infinite decoding  effort.  We will compare the performance of
              maximum likelihood  sequence detection (MLSD) of a coded MRC with that of an
              uncoded  MRC equalized to partial response shape of equivalent complexity.  
              Such partial response shapes are to be determined by this research.   This work
              has applications in very high density recording systems  where codes may in
              fact be responsible for a performance loss.  We  will seek to find partial
              response shapes appropriate for commonly  used constrained codes which, when
              combined with MLSD, provide an  improvement over today's bit-by-bit detectors. 
              The study will  include both computer simulations and analysis and will examine
              the  effectiveness of coding and partial response techniques on actual 
              recorders.  In particular, we will examine the immunity to  nonlinear
              interference, overwrite, and increased track density.
