Abstract    :
              9409890  Han  The objective of this program is to develop an improved data
              interpretation algorithm for the synthetic aperture imaging technique.  A
              composite scheme for retrieving the host medium property is integrated into the
              coherent focusing algorithm for buried object imaging. The final goal is to
              establish a general yet reliable microwave imaging system that can be used for
              inspecting targets embedded in stratified random media.  Applications to
              ground-penetrating operations and nondestructive evaluation of civil
              engineering structures are addressed.  Under this system, data carrying
              information on the property of the host medium and that of embedded targets
              will be acquired concurrently but processed separately.  A two-stage date
              processing scheme is designed to achieve this purpose.  First, the distinction
              between the spatial spectra of signals produced by localized targets and that
              by stratified structures will be used as the mechanism for isolating the signal
              from the host medium.  Then, the extracted information on the host material
              will be used in the imaging algorithm to provide the correct phase compensation
              for signals from the targets.  The following studies are included:  (i) surface
              echo isolation, (ii) subsurface profile inversion, (iii) model application to
              signal and noise prediction, (iv) development of imaging algorithm, (v)
              construction of target detection scheme, and (vi) experiments.  ***
