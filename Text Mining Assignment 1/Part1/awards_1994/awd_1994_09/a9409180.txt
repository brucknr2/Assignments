Abstract    :
              This research consists of three separate parts.  The first  involves the
              analysis of product design innovation and fashion  cycles using dynamic game
              theory.  A model of the fashion cycle  will be developed in which fashion is
              used as a signaling device  in a mating game.  Designers can create durable
              design  commodities which are used by consumers to signal and to screen 
              prospective partners.  In this context price and innovation,  diffusion of
              fashion, and conspicuous consumption behavior will  be examined.  The second
              part of the project focuses on the  comparison of equilibrium outcomes in
              dynamic games when there  are a large finite number of players and when there
              are a  continuum of players.  The third part involves analyzing the 
              participation and voting behavior in two candidate elections when  voters do
              not have the same information.  The conditions under  which voters will abstain
              form voting will be examined.  In  addition, the efficiency of elections as a
              mechanism to aggregate  information will be analyzed, as well as conditions
              under which  election outcomes are biased in favor of a minority.
