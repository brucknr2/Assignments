Abstract    :
              9409484  Bertozzi       The dynamics of a thin viscous film on a solid  surface
              are modeled by a fourth order nonlinear diffusion  equation for the film
              thickness (Greenspan, J. of Fluid Mech.  1978, vol. 84, p.  125).  The project
              involves three aspects of  this problem, singularity formation, weak solutions,
              and pattern  formation.  A singularity occurs when the thickness of the film 
              goes to zero.  Physically the singularity corresponds to a  topological
              transition in the fluid.  The study will be made via  a combination of numerics
              and analysis the onset of such  singularity formation forth order degenerate
              diffusion equations.  This work may include collaborations with M. Brenner, L. 
              Kadanoff, T. Dupont, and A. Bernoff.         The investigator is working with
              Mary Pugh at the  Courant Institute on the weak solution problem.  This 
              collaboration recently established sharper existence and long  time behavior
              results for weak solutions to the thin film  equation.  The existence is in a
              regularity class that just  includes a family of unique `source type' solutions
                     analogous to the `Barenblatt' solutions of the porous media  equation. 
              Preliminary numerical computations show that in  general weak solutions
              converge rapidly onto the `source type'  solution.  It is planned to complete
              the numerics as well as to  relate these weak solutions to slip models'
              suggested for the  spreading drop problem.  Lastly, in a joint project with M. 
              Brenner, problems in pattern formation such a gravity and  temperature driven
              fingering instabilities in thin films will be  studied.  ***
