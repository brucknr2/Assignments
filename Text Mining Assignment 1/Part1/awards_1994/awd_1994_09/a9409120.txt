Abstract    :
               This project develops a parallelizing compiler for  distributed  shared memory
              systems, and incorporates a  vertically integrated system to  manage data and
              thread locality  in parallel programs. The compiler locates  threads and data 
              statically whenever sufficient compile time information is  available to make
              near-optimal decisions. When such information  is not  available, the compiler
              provides the underlying system  with whatever  information is available, and
              lets the underlying  system utilize the  information.    The project
              investigates the following compile time issues  as  related to distributed
              memory systems: (1) automatic parallelism  for  relaxed models of memory
              consistency, (2) elimination of  false sharing, (3)  adaptive coherence
              protocols, and (4) communication optimizations.      Solutions to the issues
              are implemented within  a compiler known as  Rochester Optimizing Compiler
              (ROC). These  solutions will be evaluated using  standard benchmark programs 
              such as LINPACK, SPEC, Perfect Club, SPLASH and the  HPF benchmark  suite of
              Syracuse.
