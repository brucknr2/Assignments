Abstract    :
              9409439  Kiasaleh  Although fiber-optics systems are known to be quite reliable
              in terms of probability of bit error, multiple-access systems such as
              fiber-optic code-division multiple-access (FO-CDMA) systems suffer from
              user-induced interference.  Other optical channels, such as free-space optical
              channels, are impaired by other adverse link conditions, such as pointing
              error, turbulence, small received signal power, etc.  Error control coding is
              an important means of achieving the needed improvement in the performance of
              photon channels.  In particular, convolutional codes have been recognized as
              the suitable coding scheme for high bit rate photon channels.  The focus of
              this research is on the introduction and performance evaluation of a recently
              proposed jointly optimal synchronizer/decoder receiver structures, known as
              Joint Viterbi Decoder (JVD)and Enhanced Viterbi Decoder (EVD), for
              convolutionally-encoded pulse-position modulation (PPM) and overlapping PPM
              (OPPM) systems.  The objective here is to introduce compact, implementable
              decoders that can achieve near optimum performances.  A
              very-large-scale-integration (VLSI) implementation of the proposed decoder will
              also be attempted.  ***
