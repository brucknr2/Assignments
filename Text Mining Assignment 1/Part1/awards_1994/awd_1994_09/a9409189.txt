              proposes to establish a network of undergraduate and non-collegiate
              Teaching/Learning Laboratories within several participating industries and in a
              free-standing business incubator facility.  Through a network consisting of the
              college, Martin Marietta Government Electronic Systems, and five small
              manufacturing industries, employed and unemployed workers and other students
              will have the opportunity to participate in dustomized training and retraining
              in industry-based learning centers.  The industrial partners will work with the
              college in developing, delivering and sharing work force training curricula to
              prepare students for jobs in commercial manufacturing.  ***
