Abstract    :
              9409007  Logendra       This projects is aimed at developing instructional
              materials  for the design and control of cellular manufacturing systems.  The 
              target instructional audience are undergraduate and graduate  students and
              industrial personnel.  Eleven separate topics that  affect cellular
              manufacturing will be covered in the instructional  materials.  Instructional
              materials to be prepared will consist of  lecture notes, handouts, laboratory
              exercises, and software.  A  step by step description of methodologies (mostly
              heuristics and  optimizing algorithms) used in the design and operation of 
              cellular manufacturing and group technology based systems will be  written
              manuscript will be bound in a workbook form and distributed  to students as a
              source of reference.  Results will be shared with  other universities that
              offer courses in manufacturing.                 To ensure a wide dissemination
              of the outcome of this  research, in addition to the instructional materials
              mentioned  above, results of the research will be shared with other academic 
              institutions and industry through presentations at the National  Conference of
              the American Society of Engineering Education.   Letters outlining the
              deployment activity will be sent to  universities that have accredited programs
              in industrial and/or  manufacturing engineering.  Following this, a detailed
              course  outline, developed tools, handbook, and lab exercises will be sent  out
              to universities interested in the deployment activity.
