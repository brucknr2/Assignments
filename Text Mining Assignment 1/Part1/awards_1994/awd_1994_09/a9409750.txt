Abstract    :
                  9409750  Ma  This Research Initiation Proposal is to synthesize and process 
              macroscopic, dense, nanophase metals and alloys for a systematic  study of the
              fundamental properties of non-equilibrium materials.   Emphasis will be given
              to their densification and deformation  behaviors and mechanisms, as well as
              their kinetics of  microstructural evolution and thermodynamic stability. 
              Efforts  will be directed towards obtaining large samples which will then 
              allow traditional mechanical tests to be conducted.   Extraordinarily high
              pressures during consolidation will be used to  enhance plastic deformation
              during densification in order to obtain  the advantages of small grain size
              with reduced chances of grain  growth.  ***
