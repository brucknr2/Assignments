Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to analyze three sets of major  policy issues in
              education: 1) the distribution of education  resources, 2) the distribution of
              educational outcomes, 3) and  the distribution of the benefits of education
              reform.  Regarding  the distribution of educational resource, special attention
              will  be paid to the move in recent years to equalize school  expenditures
              across taxing jurisdictions.  The questions to be  addressed include to what
              extent has the inequality of spending  been reduced, and what evidence is there
              that changing the  distribution of spending has had important education
              benefits.  With respect to the second issue, the distribution of educational 
              outcomes has changed significantly over the past 25 years. For  example, the
              gap between black and white test scores and high  school graduation rates has
              narrowed sharply.  Special attention    will be focused on the determinants of
              these patterns.  The third  issue of education reform will focus on the
              implication of  increasing school choice and increasing the role of the private
               sector in providing public education.  In particular, little is  know about
              who the likely winners and losers would be if the  choice movement continues. 
              Special attention will focus on the  analysis of the distribution of benefits
              from expanded choice.
