Abstract    :
              9409827  Zilberstein       This project is aimed at developing a
              decision-theoretic,  adaptive approach to building systems that can perform
              robustly a  variety of real-time tasks.  Such tasks include medical diagnosis 
              job scheduling, and robot navigation.  In almost all cases, the  deliberation
              required to select optimal actions degrades the  system's overall utility.  It
              is by now well-understood that a  successful system must trade off decision
              quality for deliberation  cost.  Over the past several years, work by Dean,
              Horvitz, Russell,  Zilberstein, and others has shown that anytime algorithms
              are a  useful tool for real-time system design, since they allow  computation
              time to be larger systems from smaller, reusable  anytime modules.  The
              proposed solution to this problem is based on  novel off-line compilation
              process and run-time monitoring that can  maximize the overall utility of the
              system.  This research will  produce a new architecture for resource-bounded
              reasoning.  The  study will cover the problem of constructing anytime
              algorithms,  the representation and manipulation of conditional performance 
              profiles, and the development of efficient compilation and  monitoring
              procedures for systems composed of anytime algorithms.
