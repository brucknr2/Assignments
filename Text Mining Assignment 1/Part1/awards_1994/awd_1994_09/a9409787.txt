Abstract    :
              9409787  Rubinstein  This is an United States-Russia Joint Cooperative Research
              grant  funded jointly by the Division of Materials Research and the  Division
              of International Programs.  Professor Michael Rubinstein  of the University of
              Rochester and Eastman Kodak Company will  collaborate with Professor Alexander
              Semenov of Moscow State  University.  Theoretical research will be conducted on
              the staic  and dynamic properties of heteropolymers with strongly interacting 
              groups including block copolymers in selective solvents, ionomers  and
              associating polymers.  These systems have a number of unique  structural,
              mechanical and rheological properties.  Each research  group has complementary
              skills to study these materials.  %%%  ***
