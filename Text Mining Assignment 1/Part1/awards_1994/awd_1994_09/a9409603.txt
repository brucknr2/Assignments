Abstract    :
              9409603  Keasling  The goals of this project are to understand how low-copy
              plasmids  are maintained in bacteria by quantifying the cell-cycle  replication
              patterns, the degree of segregative stabilization,  and the metabolic burden of
              naturally-occurring replication and  segregation elements.  This information is
              to be used to design  and engineer chromosome-like vehicles in applications
              involving  complex cellular manipulations and requiring a high degree of 
              regulation.  Escherichia coli is to be used as the subject for  these
              investigations, because metabolism and macromolecular  synthesis are well
              understood in this organism.  ***
