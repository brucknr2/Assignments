Abstract    :
                  9409456  Nettleship  This Research Initiation Proposal is to support an
              experimental  study of concurrent creep and densification of ceramic materials.
                Two existing theoretical models will be evaluated by a systematic 
              experimental study and comparison made by data obtained during  pressureless
              sintering and a sinter-forging operation.  Compacts of  alumina powder will be
              prepared by colloidal methods and sintered  in a specially designed constant
              load creep apparatus.  Finally,  the sensitivity of the adapted models to
              processing variables such  as particle size and shape will be examined.  ***
