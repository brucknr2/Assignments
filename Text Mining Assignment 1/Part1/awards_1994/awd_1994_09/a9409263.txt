Abstract    :
                   Rapidly increasing storage media capabilities and spreading 
              interconnectivity have heralded the arrival of the information age.  
              Unfortunately, accessing online information remains an inexact  science.  While
              valuable information can be found, typically many  irrelevant documents are
              also retrieved and many relevant ones are  missed.  Terminology mismatches
              between the user's query and  document contents are one cause of retrieval
              failures.  Expanding  a user's query with related words can improve search
              performance,  but the problem of identifying related words remains.        
              This research uses corpus linguistics techniques to  automatically discover
              word similarities directly from the contents  of an untagged textual database
              and to incorporate that information  in an information retrieval system.  These
              similarities are  calculated based on the contexts in which the words appear. 
              Using  these similarities, user queries are automatically expanded,  resulting
              in conceptual retrieval rather than requiring exact word  matches between
              queries and documents.  The effects of using  different algorithms to calculate
              the similarities and the effects  of expanding different sets of query words is
              evaluated.  In  addition, the search performance of the retrieval engine serves
              as  a task-based method for comparing the quality of word-word  similarities
              calculated using different corpus linguistics  techniques.
