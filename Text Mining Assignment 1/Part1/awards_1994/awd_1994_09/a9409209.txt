Abstract    :
                  9409209  GORNET       For (M,g) a closed Riemannian manifold, denote by
              spec(M,g)  the collection of eigenvalues with multiplicities of the  associated
              Laplace-Beltrami operator acting on smooth functions  on M.  Gornet's research
              focuses on the question "What geometric  information is contained in the
              spectrum of a manifold?"  In  particular, she has developed a new construction
              for producing  pairs of isospectral Riemannian nilmanifolds. This construction 
              has produced new pairs of isospectral manifolds exhibiting many  properties not
              previously found. Such examples are the only way  to discover properties not
              determined by the spectrum.  Geometric properties Gornet is currently studying
              include the  length spectrum (the collection of lengths of closed geodesics) 
              and the marked length spectrum (which also includes information  on the free
              homotopy classes of the closed geodesics.) Techniques  used in Gornet's
              research come from Riemannian geometry,  representation theory, and Lie groups.
              Gornet proposes to use the  Research Planning Grant to explore new techniques
              in  representation theory and in the study of closed geodesics to  supplement
              her current background in spectral and Riemannian  geometry.  ***
