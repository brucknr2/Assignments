Abstract    :
              The research will develop and test an attitude-behavior model based on reasoned 
               action to explain individual risk judgments regarding global climate change. 
              The   model incorporates key aspects of the dominant theoretical and empirical 
               approaches to risk judgments.  The elements of the model are: levels of  
              knowledge, cultural values, perceived vulnerability, attitude toward hazard,  
              perceived social norms, and perception of control.  Survey data will be used to
              test   the model using various regression techniques as well as non-parametric
              statistics.    The results are expected to improve our understanding of public
              opinion on global   climate change, illuminate the process of risk decisions as
              they occur in polling   situations better, and help develop a more effective
              tool to pursue scientific   inference regarding risk judgments.
