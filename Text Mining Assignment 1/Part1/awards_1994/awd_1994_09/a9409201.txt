Abstract    :
                  Chemical messenger   molecules,   including    hormones  and 
              neurotransmitters,  mediate communication  between  adjacent  and  distant  
              parts   of   all  organisms.  Many  of  these  messengers   are  first  
              produced  in  inactive   precursor  forms  that  requireactivation before they
              can  exert  their  biological  action  on  cells and  tissues.  Many  precursor
               molecules  give  rise  to more than  one  type   of   active  messenger
              through this activation process.  This study  will  examine    what   rules  
              the   organisms   uses    in   the  processing   of   these   precursors.  A  
              model   precursor  molecule, proenkephalin,  will be studied. The structure  of
               proenkephalin  will   be  modified  using  recombinant   DNA  technology  to 
              reveal what parts of the  molecule  are  the  usual  sites  for  processing and
              what  influences   various  structural  features of the molecule  have   on 
              processing.  Also  using this same technology, an attempt  will  be  made  to  
              construct  new types of precursors that  will  generate  single   active 
              messengers without  having  to  go  through  extensive  procession.  Such 
              "minimal"  precursors  may  be  useful    for     delivery   of   specific   
              hormones    or  neurotransmitters in gene therapy.
