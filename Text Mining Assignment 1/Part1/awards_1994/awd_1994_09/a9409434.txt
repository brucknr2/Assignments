Abstract    :
              Kathryn Thommason is supported by a Research Planning Grant from the   Special
              Projects Program of the Chemistry Division to develop new   theoretical
              techniques for interpreting electronic spectra.  The long   term objectives of
              the research are: 1) to develop better methods for   interpreting electronic
              spectra in terms of molecular structure; 2) to   predict electronic spectra
              representing multiple conformations in   solution; 3) to develop polarizability
              parameters needed for   peptide-cation simulations; 4) to develop
              hyperpolarizability parameters   for prediction of electronic spectra; and 5)
              to develop distance   constraint parameters needed for protein-cation
              simulation studies.    Thommason's research is in the rapidly growing area
              referred to as   computer aided molecular design.  These methodologies are
              becoming   increasingly important to the pharmaceutical industry where they are
              used   to optimize lead drug candidates, and reduce the cost and development  
              time involved in drug discovery.
