Abstract    :
              9409691  Sreenivas  The research deals with the study of systems whose states
              have  logical or symbolic, rather than numerical values that change  with the
              occurrence of events called Discrete Event Dynamic  Systems (DEDS).  In this
              proposal we outline research issues  concerning modeling, analysis, control and
              performance evaluation  of DEDS.  The supervisory control problem for a broad
              class of  infinite-state DEDS is solvable.  This fact can be used to combat 
              the complexity problem in DEDS.  This issue is the focus of the  modeling and
              analysis section.  The control section addresses an  archetypal problem in the
              control of DEDS, where we propose a  novel approach to the elimination of
              deadlocks.  Finally, in the  performance section we consider an approach that
              will permit a  system designer to modify, automatically, discrete event 
              simulation programs that only estimate performance so as to  efficiently obtain
              the sensitivity of the performance.  This  sensitivity information can be used
              towards system optimization  using stochastic approximation techniques.    ***
