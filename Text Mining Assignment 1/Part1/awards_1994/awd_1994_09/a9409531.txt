Abstract    :
                 Many decision problems are faced not once but repeatedly.  For instance, the
              choice of a residential location, the selection of a travel mode for a trip to
              work, or the purchase of consumer brands within a product-class are recurrent
              choice situations.  It is therefore not surprising that much of the work on
              understanding choice behavior changed its emphasis from the analysis of single
              to the investigation of intertemporal choices.  However, despite the importance
              and promise of this research and the availability of numerous data sets in
              microeconomics, sociology, geography, and epidemiology, many issues encountered
              in the analysis of choice data over time await satisfactory solutions.     The
              major focus of the proposed research is to extend the applicability of latent
              structure choice models to the analysis of different types of longitudinal
              choice data.  These extensions address taste changes over time, dependencies
              between choices, non-stationarities in the decision-environment (including
              changing choice sets), and interactions among these factors.  The availability
              of flexible, easy to interpret and parsimonious longitudinal choice models will
              lead to important insights about decision-making over time, and they will be
              instrumental for the development and testing of economic, psychological, and
              sociological theories about the dynamics of choice behavior.
