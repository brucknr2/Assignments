Abstract    :
                19409032  Fossan    This is a collaborative project between David Fossan of
              the State  University of New York at Stony Brook and Richard Casten of 
              Brookhaven National Laboratory and Zhang Jingye of the Lanzhou  Institute of
              Modern Physics, Lanzhou, China.  This project is  sponsored jointly by NSF and
              the Chinese Academy of Sciences.    Professor Zhang is a leading nuclear
              structure theorist active in  worldwide research at the Niels Bohr Institute of
              the University  of Copenhagen and the Joint Institute for Heavy Ion Research at
               Oak Ridge.  His visits with the experimental groups at SUNY Stony  Brook and
              Brookhaven National Laboratory will focus on research  aimed at understanding
              nuclear structure of transitional nuclei.   This research is focused on the
              leading edge of low-energy  structure studies.  The key to this program is the
              effective  interaction between the experimental and the theoretical  approaches
              to the understanding of these research areas.
