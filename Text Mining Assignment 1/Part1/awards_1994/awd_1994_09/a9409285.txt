Abstract    :
              Xue   9409285  The objective of this project is to produce more effective
              sequential and parallel algorithms and software for the rapid evaluation and
              global minimization of nonconvex potential energy functions that arise in
              molecular and protein conformation problems.  The proposed research will
              combine the fast multipole algorithms and automatic differentiation to produce
              O (n) operation algorithms for both the function evaluation and the gradient
              vector evaluation for a system of n particles.  Since all existing algorithms
              require at least O (n2) operations to evaluate the gradient vector, this
              research will improve almost all existing algorithms for molecular and protein
              conformations where repeated evaluation of the function and gradient is
              required.  This success relies on two programming paradigms: a
              discrete-continuous programming paradigm that uses physical knowledge on the
              problem to guide continuous minimization searchers, and a parallel two-level
              simulated annealing programming paradigm which provides load balancing
              dynamically and moves from one local minimizer to another in an effort to
              locate a global minimizer.
