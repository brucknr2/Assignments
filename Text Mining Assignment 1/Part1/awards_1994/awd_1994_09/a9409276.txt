Abstract    :
              Optically detected resonance (ODMR) will be applied to a study of  point 
              defects  in  two  ternary  chalcopyrites  (silver  gallium  selenide and zinc
              germanium phosphide). These semiconductors have  been  identified  as  primary
              candidates for frequency-conversion  applications in the near and mid-infrared
              wavelength regions. The  proposed studies will help to identify and
              characterize the point  defects responsible for unwanted optical absorption
              bands in  the  range from 0.7 to 2.0 microns in these materials.    Nonlinear 
              optical materials are used in tunable  infrared  laser  systems.  Two prime
              candidates, silver gallium selenide and  zinc  germanium  phosphide,  have met
              limited success  due  to  defects  which  produce  optical  absorption bands.
              Optical  spectroscopic  techniques which allow atomic scale resolution will be
              applied to  characterize the defects.
