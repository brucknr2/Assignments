Abstract    :
              9409963  Chen       The award is for research to understand and model the 
              fundamental physical mechanisms which govern the deformation  behavior of 2D
              and 3D textile woven fabrics used as preforms in  composite manufacturing. 
              Model experiments will be conducted to  quantify local unit cell behavior under
              a variety of constraint  conditions and to determine critical strain conditions
              for fiber  buckling for various weave patterns.  Results from those 
              experiments will be incorporated into a unit cell model that can be  used to
              predict quality of conformance to complex part shapes.       The research is
              directed toward the establishment of  scientific design guidelines for more
              efficient use of textile  preforms.  Insights gained from the research are
              likely to lead to  the development of new, innovative, and robust methods for
              high  volume manufacturing of composite parts.
