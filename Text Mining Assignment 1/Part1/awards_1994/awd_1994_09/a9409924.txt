Abstract    :
              IRI-9409924  Chang, Ai-Mei  University of Arizona  $29,691 - 12 mos.    RIA: 
              Cooperation Support Systems for Group Problem  Solving      This is the third
              year funding of a three-year  continuing award. Many problems that are
              encountered in  an organizational setting are large and complex enough  that
              they require a team/group effort for efficient and  effective resolution. 
              These problems are usually  decomposed into subproblems which allows team
              members,  each of whom is responsible for a distinct subproblem  depending on
              their area of expertise, to work on  subproblems and resolve the overall
              problem through  coordination with each other.  In some cases, the  problems
              are well-structured so that a decomposition of  the overall problem will result
              in relatively  independent subproblems, which may facilitate  concurrent
              resolution of subproblems.  This is followed  by information exchange and
              cooperation between team  members to resolve the overall problem.  In some
              cases,  problems may be ill-structured, ill-defined, and/or  subproblems may be
              highly interdependent so that team  members may have to collectively deliberate
              on the  various aspects of the problem to resolve it.  Most  other problems are
              usually in between these extreme  cases.  Examples of such problems range from 
              engineering and software design, project planning to  project selection,
              product design and marketing, make  or buy decisions, audit going concern
              decisions, and  many other organizational decisions that involve an  interface
              of different organizational functions.  This  project addresses the issue of
              designing information  sharing and cooperation mechanisms to support the 
              overall problem resolution process using AI techniques  and Argumentation
              Theory.
