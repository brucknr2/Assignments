Abstract    :
              9409192  Barber    This award, in the Small Grants for Exploratory Research
              mode,  funds initial exploration of artificially-intelligent agent-based 
              architectures for manufacturing automation.  Manufacturing  automation
              engineers agree that the manufacturing domain is complex  and dynamic.
              Manufacturing solutions must move toward agent-based  architectures which
              better model real world behaviors and  knowledge at any instance in time.
              Agents perform a particular task  or responsibility to achieve a specified
              goal. A multi-agent system  is comprised of these intelligent agents
              responsible for their own  communication, diagnosis, repair, control and
              configuration.   One  of the critical considerations for sensible agent
              behavior is level  of autonomy.  The extent of autonomy can be distinguished
              from  locally-autonomous to consensus (negotiation) to command-driven.  The
              level of autonomy describes the ability of an agent to execute  behaviors
              independent of approval or direction from other agents  within the system.   
              This research addresses two topics vital to the success of  manufacturing
              automation:  formal engineering methodologies and the  distribution of
              planning, monitoring, and control through  autonomous agents.  The proposed
              research objective is to develop  a theoretical model for the stability
              analysis of autonomous agent  behaviors operating in distributed, multi-agent
              systems.   Responsibility-driven object-oriented methodologies will serve to 
              provide a formal procedure by which agents are identified,  specified,
              modified, and maintained.  The theoretical stability  analysis model promotes
              the practical deployment of autonomous  agents in manufacturing solutions by
              enabling agents to analyze and  consequently behave sensibly incorporating an
              understanding of both  global and local goals.
