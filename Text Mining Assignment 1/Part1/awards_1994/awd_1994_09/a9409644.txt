Abstract    :
              9409644  Kenttamaa  Purdue University    Ion-molecule reaction strategies for
              the synthesis and structural characterization of gaseous organic radical
              cations will be developed. Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass
              spectroscopy will be used to study the stability, reaction paths, kinetics, and
              thermochemistry of these radical cations. The role of the charge site in
              reactions of these species will be addressed by using ions with different types
              of radical sites, and ions with different structures separating the radical
              site from the charge site. The use of electron withdrawing and donating
              substituents and a rigid molecular framework will be employed to accomplish
              these goals.     This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the
              continuing work of Professor Hilkka Kenttamaa at Purdue University. The
              synthesis and characterization of distonic radical cations in the gas-phase
              will be undertaken by Professor Kenttamaa. These relatively little-studied
              species are characterized by having a unit of positive charge and one odd
              electron on non-adjacent atoms in a molecule. Unique synthetic routes will be
              used to place the charge and odd electron in different portions of the molecule
              and to then determine the reactions that these species undergo. Mass
              spectrometric methods, which measure the mass to charge ratio of species, will
              be used to characterize the distonic ions and their reaction products.
