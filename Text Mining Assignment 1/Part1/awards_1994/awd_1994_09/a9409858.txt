Abstract    :
              Kristin Krantzman is supported  by a Research Planning Grant from the   Special
              Projects Program in the Chemistry Division to perform theoretical   studies of
              the Eley-Rideal mechanism for reactions between atomic   hydrogen and
              adsorbates on silicon surfaces.  The Eley-Rideal mechanism,   which involves a
              direct reaction between an incoming gas atom and an   equilibrated adsorbate,
              is quite distinct from the Langmuir-Hinshelwood   mechanism, in which a
              reaction occurs between equilibrated adsorbates.    Krantzman will attempt to
              elucidate the mechanism using a combination of   classical trajectory
              simulations and density functional theory.  The   specific objectives of her
              research are: 1) to perform molecular dynamics   simulations related to the
              Eley-Rideal mechanism; 2) to use density   functional theory to calculate
              energies of configurations important to   elucidation the mechanism; and 3) to
              use density functional theory to   generate accurate potential energy surfaces
              for further simulations.    Recently the goal of surface chemistry has advanced
              beyond traditional   heterogeneous catalysis toward microengineering on the
              atomic scale.  For   example, in the microelectronics industry, integrated
              circuits are   fabricated by the deposition of epitaxial silicon films and
              etching them   with plasmas.  In order to make our dream of building materials
              atom by   atom a reality, a picture of the mechanisms underlying these
              gas-surface   processes is essential.  A fundamental atomic level understanding
              of the   Eley-Rideal mechanism will help to achieve this goal for processes
              which   require low substrate temperatures so that side reactions with the  
              surface are minimized.
