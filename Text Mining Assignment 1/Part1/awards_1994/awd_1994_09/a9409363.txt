Abstract    :
              9409363  Yarmush  This American Institute of Medical and Biological Engineering 
              (AIMBE) conference will examine the need for a more quantitative  and
              integrated approach in future developments of biotechnology  and the role of
              engineering in meeting this challenge.   Outstanding investigators and
              prominent policy-makers will  present their views on technical and policy
              issues impacting on  the engineering and science base for biotechnology.  This
              overall  theme is to be developed over a two-day meeting that is expected  to
              attract 300-500 participants.  Leaders in the bioengineering  and medical
              communities are to become aware of:  (1) the  diversity of contributions that
              engineers have made in advancing  the field of biotechnology; and (2) important
              areas that require  engineering insight and know-how for future developments.
