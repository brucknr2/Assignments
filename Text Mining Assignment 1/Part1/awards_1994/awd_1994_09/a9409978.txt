Abstract    :
              9409978  Cahay  This grant supports the participation of graduate students at
              the Second International Symposium on Quantum Confinement (Physics and
              Applications) to be held as a part of the 185th Meeting of the Electrochemical
              Society in San Francisco (May 22-27, 1994).  The symposium is dedicated to
              recent research in hot electron and quantum transport in mesoscopic structures,
              specifically quantum wires and dots.  Novel optical phenomena in wires and dots
              (including research in light emission mechanisms of porous silicon) is also of
              interest.  Of particular importance are cooperative phenomena in coupled dot
              and wires (including both linear arrays and lateral surface supperlattices) and
              exchange mediated artificially engineering many body ground states in such
              systems.  The symposium will address all aspects of fabrication,
              characterization and modelling of both semiconductor and superconductor
              mesoscopic structures and coupled systems.  This is a field which continues to
              burgeon and promises vastly improved for the next century.  ***
