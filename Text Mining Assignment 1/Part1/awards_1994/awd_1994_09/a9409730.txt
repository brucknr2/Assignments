Abstract    :
              9409730  Sands  The principal objectives of the proposed research are i) to
              understand the role of A1 additions in homogenizing the microstructure of MnBi
              thin films and ii) to explore the application of nanoscale patterning of these
              films to further improving film homogeneity through suppressing the formation
              of a metastable low-temperature phase and reducing the effective grain size. 
              These objectives address the primary obstacles, media noise and stability, in
              developing MnBi as a medium for ultra-high density magneto-optic recording at
              blue laser wavelengths.  This technology, if realized, could offer ubiquitous
              access to low-cost removable and rewritable optical media for digital image and
              video applications.  More generally, the proposed research will contribute to
              advances in the control of polycrystalline thin-film properties on the scale of
              tens of nanometers through the application of nanoscale film patterning
              techniques to fabricate "artificial polycrystallinity." Such control will be
              essential to continued application of polycrystalline storage media for
              ultra-high density(>1Gbit/in2) magnetic recording, nonvolatile ferroelectric
              memories, rewritable optical storage and Gbit dynamic random access memories
              (DRAM) utilizing high permittivity polycrystalline oxides for charge storage.
