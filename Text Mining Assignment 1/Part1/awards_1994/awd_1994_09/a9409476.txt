Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to recover a missing link in the  early history
              of English banking,-- the legal background to the  rapid dominance of England
              in European banking.  As such, it  fills a gap that the strictly economic
              evidence in banking and  archiving does not supply.  Bankers during that time
              were  familiar with that law and often sought to refine that nexus  which for
              historians does not reflect itself in printed legal  materials.  However, there
              is in an unpublished archive a body of  law pertaining to early banking in
              England.  The project will  retrieve and analyze that forgotten legal tradition
              through an on  site inspection of this unexplored archive.  The fundamental 
              research questions to be addressed concern the degree of  regulation banking
              faced in its early evolution.  Were there a  range of legal regulations
              relating to negotiable instruments,  reserves, registration of banking
              conveyances, and deposits that  are unknown to historians today but existed at
              the time?  This  research is important because it will shed important new light
              on  the evolution and regulation of financial institutions.
