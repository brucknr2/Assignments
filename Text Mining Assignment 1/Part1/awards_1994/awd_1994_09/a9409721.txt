Abstract    :
              Growth-Associated Protein-(GAP)-43 has been implicated in a  wide variety of
              phenomena in the nervous system.  The  physical characteristics of the
              molecule, together with its  elevated expression during periods of neuronal
              growth and  regeneration, suggest that it might play a role in the  extension
              of nerve fibers toward their targets.  GAP-43 also  appears to be involved in
              some way in the regulation of  neurotransmitter secretion in the mature nervous
              system,  perhaps because it modulates several biochemical signaling  systems
              within the nerve cell.  Despite the accumulation of  a large amount of
              experimental information on GAP-43, the  precise function of the protein
              remains elusive.    We have used a model cell culture system consisting of two 
              closely related neuroendocrine cell lines which express GAP-  43 at
              dramatically different levels to investigate further  the role of GAP-43 in
              neurotransmitter secretion.  Our  initial experiments demonstrated that the
              secretory response  is highly correlated with the levels of GAP-43 expression
              in  these cells.  Subsequently, we have used molecular genetic  approaches to
              manipulate GAP-43 expression and have obtained  more direct evidence for a role
              of this protein in  secretion.  Our experiment system will thus permit us to 
              determine the molecular basis of this role; this information  may be relevant
              to the other postulated functions of GAP-43  as well.
