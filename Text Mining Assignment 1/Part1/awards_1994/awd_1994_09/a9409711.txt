Abstract    :
              The PI proposes  to investigate high performance work teams.  His partner in
              this Private Sector Initiative, Sara Lee Knit Products, has found considerable
              variation in the performance of the work teams implemented throughout their
              organization.  The PI will test work team performance models in three textile
              plants.  Qualitative and quantitative analyses will be performed on a 12-month
              longitudinal data set containing work team performance measures, employee
              perceptions, and team composition information.
