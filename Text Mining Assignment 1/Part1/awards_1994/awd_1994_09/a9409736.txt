Abstract    :
               Parallel program decomposition is the process by which a single  application is
              decomposed into multiple processes for  execution on parallel  hardware.  For
              real programs, the  execution speed of a good decomposition can  exceed that of
              a  poor decomposition by factors of ten or more.  Unfortunately,  optimal
              program decomposition is known to be an NP-hard  problem, and efficient  exact
              solutions are unlikely to  exist.  Hence, the key to finding automatic 
              approaches to  the program decomposition lies in discovering efficient 
              algorithms that produce approximate solutions.    A novel decomposition 
              algorithm with nearly linear time  complexity is explored.  The algorithm 
              initially decomposes  the program into a sequence of small, parallelizable 
              sections of code, known as partitionables.  A locally  optimal decomposition is
               selected for each partitionable  based on information contained in an 
              empirically derived  database.  Dynamic data redistribution is combined with a 
              static technique called decomposition smoothing to produce a  good global 
              decomposition.    The principal contributions of the research are:  (1) to 
              define new methods for program decomposition that go beyond  simply minimizing 
              communication and consider aggregate  parallel execution performance, (2) to 
              establish the extent  to which fast decomposition strategies can produce 
              acceptable solutions for practical applications, and (3) to  collect and 
              disseminate a database of performance results from kernels of scientific 
              applications.
