Abstract    :
              The grant will be used to partially support 15 students  (~10% of the audience)
              at the Nuclear Chemistry Gordon  Research Conference, June 19-24, 1994.  This
              year the  conference will deal with topics in Nuclear Reactions with  special
              emphasis on giant resonances at finite temperature,  nuclear interferometry,
              positron emission from heavy  systems, astrophysics and world climatic changes.
               These  topics are all at the forefront of current activity in  Nuclear
              Physics.  These conferences have long played an  important role in introducing
              graduate students to the  forefront of research activities with easy informal
              contact  between students from US and European institutions with the  leaders
              in the field presenting early results of their  current research.  ***
