Abstract    :
                      9309754  Shield  As laminated fiber composite structural elements become
              more  popular, their mechanical properties need to be efficiently  modeled; in
              particular, that there be a complete understanding of  their buckling and
              postbuckling behavior.  The work will plan for  a study focused on the
              development of methods for analyzing the  local, Euler, and flexural-torsional
              modes of buckling in laminated  composite beams of open and closed cross
              section.  The effects of  shear deformation will be accounted for. The methods
              will be  developed for beams whose cross-sectional elements consist of 
              rectangular laminated plates with varying degrees of anisotropy.
