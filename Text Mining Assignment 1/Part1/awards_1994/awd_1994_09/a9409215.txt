Abstract    :
              9409215  Filipowski       This research is aimed at constructing linear
              programming  algorithms that provide approximate solutions when inexact data is
               used.  The algorithms will initiate the solution process by  assuming zero
              values for some coefficients so as to lessen the  degree of data accuracy
              required to solve a problem instance.  The  algorithms will be implemented,
              tested, and compared with the  performance of interval analysis based
              algorithms.  The results  obtained from this research will be used to develop
              new  computational complexity theory that incorporates the use of  inexact data
              in solving linear programming problems.       Understanding the complexity of
              solving problem instances  given only an approximation to the data of the
              instance to be  solved will lead to the development of algorithms that can
              solve  more efficiently, a wide variety of engineering problems.
