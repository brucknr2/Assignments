Abstract    :
              9409273  Ray       The author proposes to investigate several open problems in 
              nonlinear time series analysis, with the goal of combining  techniques from
              nonparametric regression modeling and linear time  series analysis and
              extending them to the nonlinear time series  framework. In particular, the
              author plans to investigate the  appropriateness of nonparametric regression
              techniques for  modeling nonlinear processes having very slowly decaying serial
               correlation, known as long-range dependence.  Modifications of  existing
              procedures that take into account the amount of  correlation in a series will
              be investigated.  Additionally,  the author will investigate appropriate
              methods of testing  model assumptions underlying the use of nonlinear
              regression  algorithms when the algorithms are applied to time series.      
              The author also plans to extend existing methodology  concerning tests of
              nonlinearity in univariate series to the  multivariate case. Data-driven
              methods for obtaining full  multivariate nonlinear models will be investigated.
               Finally, the  author will consider the advantages, in terms of forecasting, 
              of using a data-driven nonlinear model for data which suggests  a nonlinear
              generating process.  ***
