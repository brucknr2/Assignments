Abstract    :
              9409964  Yan  Preparation of expitaxial electro-optic thin films is the base for
               fabricating new integrated electro-optic and optoelectronic  devices.  To have
              good electro-optic performance, the films should  be in a single domain
              structure, which can not be achieved  automatically in the growth processes. 
              This project is to study  ways to prepare epitaxial electro-optic thin films
              with single  crystal and single domain structure.  LiTaO3 and LiNbO3 films with
               multilayer structure will be deposited by RF magnetron sputtering  and laser
              ablation.  The expitaxial LiTaO3 and LiNbO3 films will be  poled by an electric
              field after the deposition process.  The  electro-optic coefficients of the
              poled epitaxial LiTaO3 and LiNbO3  film waveguides will be measured and the
              correlation with the  poling conditions will be studied.  The objectives are to
               successfully prepare single domain epitaxial LiTaO3 and LiNbO3 film 
              waveguides with good electro-optic property and to understand the  basic
              process.  ***
