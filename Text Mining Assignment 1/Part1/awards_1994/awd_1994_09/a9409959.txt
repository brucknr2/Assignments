Abstract    :
                9409959  Lyons  This research will examine the microstructure of foreign 
              exchange markets. The work includes both theoretical and  empirical dimensions,
              each of which enhances its policy  relevance. The theoretical dimensions of the
              project will  examine the link between the microstructure of these  markets,
              for example the behavior of individual traders and  the macro-relevant aspect
              of these markets, for example  forward exchange rate bias. The empirical part
              of the  project focuses on understanding how foreign exchange  markets work.
              This part of the study uses a  unique data set  to examine the effects of the
              pace of market activity on  prices and quantities of trades, etc. The data
              contain  information on quotes, trades, and inventory positions of a  foreign
              exchange dealer at identified points in time. The  study also examines the
              policy implications of what is  understood about the behavior of foreign
              exchange markets.       This project is important because it promises to 
              improve our understanding of how foreign exchange markets  work at a time when
              several countries are in transition  towards market economies, and each country
              is seeking better  ways to organize the market that sets its foreign exchange 
              rates.
