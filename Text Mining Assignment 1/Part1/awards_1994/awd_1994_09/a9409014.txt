Abstract    :
              9409014  Kurucz  This is an award to support conduct of a Conference and
              Workshop  on recent advances made in uses of ionizing radiation for 
              decontamination of solids, fluids and gases.  The workshop will  include
              presentation and discussion of results from research  conducted under NSF Grant
              No. 91-08033 to the University of Miami  and the associated subcontract with
              Florida International  University's Drinking Water Research Center.  This
              research has  been conducted with a large, engineering-scale, electron-beam 
              accelerator located at the Miami-Dade wastewater treatment plant  on Virginia
              Key.  The workshop will address progress made in  destruction of hazardous
              organic compounds in contaminated water,  soil and gaseous waste streams and
              the potential application of  this environmental technology for disinfection of
              infectious  medical solid and liquid wastes.    The workshop is expected to
              result in identification of further  needed research that has promise of
              advancing uses of ionizing  radiation in engineering design of processes and
              systems for  decontamination of environmental resources.  ***
