Abstract    :
              The purpose of this research is to empirically analyze the  effects of
              incomplete information concerning people's HIV status  on their sexual behavior
              and the spread of the AIDS.  The study  will utilize data from the San
              Francisco Home Health Study and  will obtain three sets of estimates to address
              three different  objectives.  First, the fraction of individuals engaging in 
              potentially disease transmitting circumstances will be assessed.   Second,
              estimates will be obtained of both the extent to which  incomplete information
              is present during the transmissive  activity and the effect it has on such
              activity.  Third, the  study will be determined how the prevalence of AIDS
              might  stabilize itself over time.  This research is important because  public
              health interventions aimed at controlling the epidemic are  almost exclusively
              information based and because this project has  important implications for the
              effects of such measures.
