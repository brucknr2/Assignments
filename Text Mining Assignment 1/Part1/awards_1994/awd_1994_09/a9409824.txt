Abstract    :
              9409824  Jagannathan    A substantial part of the research effort in finance is
              directed  toward improving our understanding of how investors value risky  cash
              flows.  It is generally agreed that investors demand a  higher expected return
              for investing in riskier projects, or  securities.  However, we still do not
              fully understand how  investors assess the risk of a project's cash flow and
              how they  determine what risk premium to demand.  The contribution of this 
              grant comes from a reassessment of the Capital Asset Pricing  Model (CAPM), the
              framework used most often by financial managers  to assess the risk of the cash
              flow from a project and the  preferred model for classroom use in MBA and other
              managerial  finance courses.  The empirical evidence accumulated over the  past
              two decades on the CAPM is weak, but CAPM continues to be  used because the
              empirical support for other asset pricing models  is also weak and the
              theoretical underpinnings of CAPM are better  than those for alternative
              models.  The investigator builds on  his previous theoretical and empirical
              research on CAPM.   Specifically, the investigator shows that by relaxing 
              unreasonable auxiliary assumptions usually made in empirical  studies of CAPM
              and by taking the return to human capital into  account in measuring the return
              to aggregate wealth, he is able  to obtain surprisingly strong empirical
              support for CAPM.  In  this research the investigator will use standard tests
              of asset  pricing models with time varying parameters and develop some new 
              statistical tests and examine their small sample properties.
