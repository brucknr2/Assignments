Abstract    :
              We propose to explore the construction of a high resolution  scanning probe
              microscope capable of gathering inelastic  electron tunneling spectra (IETS)
              from biological samples  with nm resolution. This would be the first
              high-resolution  instrument for mapping the distribution of organic  molecules.
              It will be based on an  atomic force microscope  operated at helium
              temperatures. IETS of a thin-film  sample  will be gathered using a conductive
              coating on the tip.  Achieving this goal requires major advances in AFM 
              technology, microtome technology and sample  mounting  methods. Here, We
              request a Small Grant for Exploratory  Research in  order to carry out a
              feasibility study with a  much simpler system, an AFM equipped  for IETS and
              operating  at liquid nitrogen temperatures.
