Abstract    :
              The proposed research shall systematically investigate the  role of laser
              shaping parameters in optimizing material  removal rates, surface quality,
              mechanical properties and  residual stresses in laser shaped silicon carbide
              and  SiC/SiC ceramics.  This understanding will be used to  machine complex
              shapes and then compare such bodies; for the  surface finish, mechanical
              properties and material removal  rates; with those produced by the diamond
              grinding, water  jet cutting and ultrasonic machining.    The proposed research
              opportunity will give Dr. Todd an  avenue to advance her career and establish
              an  interdisciplinary activities such as supervising the  graduate students in
              both materials and mechanical  engineering at Illinois Institute of Technology 
                The PI will investigate the role of laser shaping parameters  in laser shaped
              ceramics and compare those with materials  machined by other techniques such as
              diamond grinding, water  jet cutting and ultrasonic techniques.
