Abstract    :
                The needs of many application domains are not met by current  database system
              technology.  Relational database systems (RDBMSs)  excel at providing
              high-level, associative (i.e., query-based)  access to large sets of flat
              records.  Object-oriented database  systems (OODBMSs) on the other hand,
              provide more powerful data  modelling capabilities, but primarily support
              navigation-based  access to the data.  The goal of this research is to develop 
              flexible workstation/server database systems which can dynamically  adapt to
              the requirements of a wide range of applications, allowing  those applications
              to exploit database capabilities and benefit  from the continuing rapid gains
              in workstation and local area  network price/performance.  Such database
              systems will be able to  adaptively choose between query-oriented and
              navigation-oriented  strategies based on both compile-time and runtime
              considerations.   The approach taken will be to extend the techniques that have
              been  recently developed for navigation-oriented OODBMSs to co-exist with 
              techniques from the more traditional query-oriented (relational)  approach.  
              To achieve this end, however, will require significant  work in performance
              modeling and analysis, the development of new  data management algorithms and
              new query optimization techniques,  and the resolution of numerous database
              systems architecture  issues.  The results of this project will include
              analyses of the  tradeoffs between data-shipping and query-shipping, algorithms
              for  cache maintenance, query optimization, and memory management, and 
              detailed performance analyses based on simulation and  implementation of these
              new techniques.
