Abstract    :
              Field  9409171  This is an award to support research on surfactant transport in 
              aquifers.  The investigator plans initially to study the  biodegradation of
              linear alkylbenzenesulfonate surfactants in an  oxygenated zone of a
              wastewater-contaminated groundwater aquifer  and in an oxygenated zone of
              uncontaminated groundwater at a  field location operated by the U.S. Geological
              Survey's Otis Air  Force Base test site on Cape Cod in Massachusetts.  A
              subsequent  phase will involve the continuous injection of a surfactant into 
              the oxygen-depleted zone of contaminated groundwater to determine  the lag time
              required to initiate degradation of the surfactant.    Results of this project
              are expected to include an improved  understanding of the processes that affect
              surfactant fate and  transport in groundwater.  This in turn is expected to
              influence  the engineering design of systems based on use of surfactants to 
              remove contaminants from contaminated aquifers.  ***
