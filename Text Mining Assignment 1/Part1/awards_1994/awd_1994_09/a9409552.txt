Abstract    :
                9409552  Schaefer                        ABSTRACT   As a part of an
              interlocking program of linguistic documentation, this grant provides funding
              to undertake formation of a bilingual dictionary for Emai, a previously
              undescribed language of southern Nigeria. Utilizing linguistic resources
              developed through previous fieldwork, the PI will analyze and select pertinent
              lexicographic information and arrange it on computer files in the form of
              suitable Emai:English and English: Emai dictionary entries. The result, which
              will complement a selection of oral tradition texts and a reference grammar,
              will be a descriptive dictionary intended for scholars from a range of
              disciplines.  ***
