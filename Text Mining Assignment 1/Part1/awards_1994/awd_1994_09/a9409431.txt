Abstract    :
              9409431  Tsukruk  Various potential boundary lubricant films will be formed on 
              solid surfaces from thermostable rigid and semi-rigid polymers  with functional
              groups.  The polymers selected will have the  potential of forming liquid
              crystalline order in the bulk state  and smooth, monomolecular films in solid
              surfaces.  Formation of  the films will take place by a molecular engineering
              process that  includes a combination of selective adsorption on the surface, 
              self assembly and chemical bonding to the surface, and Langmuir-  Blodgett
              transfer.  Relationships between molecular structure and  tribological
              performance will be determined at the macroscopic,  microscopic, and atomic
              levels.  ***
