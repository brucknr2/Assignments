                                        ABSTRACT                                  9409130 
              KAY, Laura    In 'unified models' of Active Galactic Nuclei, orientation 
              effects play a large role in determining what we see and  thus how we classify
              a given object.  One of the missing  pieces in these models is the
              identification of Narrow-Line  (Type 2) QSO's.  Optical spectropolarimetry has
              been used  successfully to show that some Type 2 AGN are in fact  obscured Type
              1 (Broad and Narrow-Line)AGN.  For this  project, the principal investigator
              will use  spectropolarimetry to study 'superluminous' and  ultraluminous' Type
              2 AGN identified by IRAS to see if some  of them harbor a Type I QSO nucleus
              identifiable only in  scattered, and thus polarized, light.  If a collection of
               such obscured quasars is identified, then complementary  observations in
              infrared and possibly with HST will be  planned.    Undergraduate students from
              Barnard College will participate  in this project through independent study
              during the  academic year or as summer students.
