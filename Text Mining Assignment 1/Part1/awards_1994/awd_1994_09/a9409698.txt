Abstract    :
                In collaboration with Michael Birnbaum (SBR-9410572) the PI proposes to study
              risk attitudes.  The PI will investigate the behavior and attitudes of people
              who participate in "The Big Spin," which is the California State Lottery's TV
              show.  The PI will be given access to the participants before, during, and
              after their participation in the televised portion of the lottery.  The risk
              attitudes of these persons will be compared at various time periods, and their
              responses will also be compared to the responses of a control group of
              non-participants.  A one-year follow-up of all participants is included in the
              design.
