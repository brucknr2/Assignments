Abstract    :
              9409295  Zukow-Goldring                                ABSTRACT    A conference
              on "Changing Ecological Approaches to Development:   Organism-Environment
              Mutualities" will be held at the University  of Connecticut, September
              29-October 2, 1994. Participants  represent an interesting mix of perspectives
              and will include  researchers who normally do not participate in the same 
              conferences nor publish in the same journals: those who work in  ecological
              psychology and those who work in epigenetic and  dynamic systems. Leading
              researchers will each discuss the same  set of questions in light of their
              particular work to provide  coherence among the presentations.  Discussants
              will represent  different theoretical approaches in order to challenge the 
              presenting participants. A book based on the conference  presentations will be
              published by the American Psychological  Association.  ***
