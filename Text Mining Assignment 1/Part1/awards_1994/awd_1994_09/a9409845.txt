Abstract    :
                Multiprocessor database machines, with their promise of high  availability,
              scalability and performance, are increasingly the  systems of choice for large
              applications.  Efficient resource  utilization is crucial for maximizing both a
              response time of  individual queries and the overall system throughout. 
              Resource  utilization issues include how to allocate memory to workload 
              components, how many and which queries to run in parallel, how to  share the
              system resources to improve the system performance.  We  restrict our attention
              to parallel shared-nothing database systems.   In our previous research, batch
              scheduling of the query workload  was studied.  We demonstrated that sharing
              low-level query  operators can provide significant savings.  In this project,
              we  shall perform research into the following areas: 1)  Memory  Management for
              Mixed Workloads.  These workloads mix simple queries  and short ad-hoc read
              transactions.  We shall study an incremental  memory allocation method for
              processing a mixed workload.  2)  Data  Placement.  For a system consisting of
              several hundred nodes, full  declustering can lead to a performance
              degradation.  Alternative  placement methods will be examined.  The proposed
              research will  involve both the development of algorithms for problems in these
               areas and their experimental analysis using a precise simulation of  a
              parallel shared-nothing system.
