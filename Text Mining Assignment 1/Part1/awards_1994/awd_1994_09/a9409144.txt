Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the  
              Chemistry Division, Baer will study the conformations of small organic  
              molecules using various spectroscopic techniques.  In one set of   experiments
              the structures of simple linear and cyclic ethers and ketones   will be
              determined. Enthalpy differences between conformers will be   measured using a
              heated valve technique.  In the second study the   structure of more complex
              steroids will be determined.    Resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization
              (REMPI) and pulsed field   ionization threshold photoelectron spectroscopy
              (PFI-TPES) are two   techniques which will be used to measure the Rydberg
              spectra and   ionization energies.    %%%  Since data from isolated gas-phase
              molecules and those in the liquid   phase will be compared, the results of
              these spectroscopic investigations   will provide insight into solvation
              effects on the spectra and structural   properties of molecules.  The data on
              steroid conformations will help in   the understanding of the shapes and
              structures of biological molecules.    Such data impact many fields, from the
              understanding of the mechanism of   drug action to the synthesis of materials
              by biotechnological methods.
