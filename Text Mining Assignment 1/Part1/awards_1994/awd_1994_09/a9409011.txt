Abstract    :
              9409011  Leamer  This research will study the consequences of partial  economic
              integration of high-wage and low-wage countries.  The study is divided into two
              parts. In the first part,  several alternative theoretical models of economic 
              integration are formulated which focus particularly on the  effect of global
              competition on internal labor markets. The  second part of the study uses the
              theoretical models to  develop empirical analyses of the effects of economic 
              integration on employment, prices, wages and other economic  outcomes in
              particular sectors of the economy or among  particular groups of workers.      
              This research is of significant interest because the  empirical results would
              improve our understanding of what  role trade and investment with low-wage
              countries might play  in eroding or increasing wages in the United States. .
