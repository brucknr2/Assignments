Abstract    :
              9409429  Zhang  The research proposed in this RIA is a computer simulation study
               of the respiratory flow and transport processes within the entire  human upper
              airways, including nasal and oral airways, laryngeal  airway, and first three
              generation of tracheobronchial tree.  Airways will be cascaded and computer
              simulation will be  conducted in the integrated respiratory system.  Flow
              patterns  within the airway system will be investigated by numerically  solving
              the corresponding full Navier-Stokes equations in a three-  dimensional
              curvilinear coordinated system.  Body-fitted grids in  conjunction with the
              grid block-off method will be employed to  mimic the complex airway geometry. 
              A unified trajectory mapping  approach will be used to compute particle
              trajectories.  ***
