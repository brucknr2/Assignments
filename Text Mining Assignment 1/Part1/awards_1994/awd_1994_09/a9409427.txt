Abstract    :
              9409427  Bennett       This research examines multivariate decision tree
              induction as  a mathematical program solved in serial or parallel.  Depending
              on  the splitting criterion or objective function minimized, the  problem of
              constructing each decision node in the tree is a linear,  piecewise-quadratic,
              bilinear, or multilinear program.  Unlike  previous perceptron-type and
              randomized algorithms, the proposed  mathematical programs exactly characterize
              an optimal solution of  the decision node problem.  A new splitting criterion,
              subtree  optimization, is proposed.  Subtree optimization differs from 
              previous greedy decision tree algorithms in that it explicitly  considers all
              subsequent decisions when constructing the current  decision node.  Subtree
              optimization can be used to generate a  globally optimal tree with a fixed
              topology.  The goals of this  work are to create better decision tree
              algorithms, gain a better  mathematical understanding of the bias of splitting
              criteria,  develop new mathematical programming theory and techniques for 
              solving these problems, and implement and test these algorithms on  serial and
              parallel computers.
