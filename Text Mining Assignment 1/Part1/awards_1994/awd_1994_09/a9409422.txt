Abstract    :
                   This career advancement award supports mathematical research  in the field
              of iterative methods for large systems of equations  arising in image
              processing.  Application to image processing and  medical imaging is planned. 
              The central problem of image  restoration is the estimation of the original
              image, given a  version of the image degraded by noise and blur.  Work will be
              done  developing and analyzing new fast algorithms for the computation of  the
              estimated image.  Two different approaches to image restoration  predominate,
              (i) algebraic restoration, viewed as a linear,  possibly ill-conditioned,
              system of equations and (ii) stochastic  restoration where one regards the
              problem of estimating vectors  subject to random disturbances.  Numerical
              methods for both  approaches will be developed.  Either approach yields linear 
              systems of equations that have a structure that can be used in the  development
              and analysis of efficient algorithms for image  restoration.  The structure
              depends on the assumptions made on the  image and the noise.  The matrices in
              these systems are typically  quite large.  The computational work, even with
              efficient methods,  is demanding.  Since many applications require real-time
              image  restoration, the development of algorithms for parallel computers  is
              important.  Work done on this project focuses on the development  of iterative
              methods that lend themselves will to implementation on  multiprocessors.
