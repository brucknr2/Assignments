Abstract    :
              9409882  Peck  This research will explore the impact of demand uncertainity- 
              -uncertainty about the number and types of customers-- on  the workings of
              markets. The study is divided into two  parts. The first part will demonstrate
              that, under suitable  conditions, the only firms who survive competition are
              those  who commit to sell at a fixed price. If demand is higher  than expected,
              firms ration some of their customers rather  than increase their prices. This
              "price competition" has  been assumed by previous authors; this study attempts
              to  explain it. The second part of the study will show how the  nature of
              demand uncertainty can effect the efficiency of  manufacturer-retailer
              relationships. Specifically, it will  compare resale price maintenance, where
              the retail price is  set by the manufacturer, to a perfectly competitive retail
               market. Conditions will be derived under which resale price  maintenance
              provides higher profits to the manufacturer and  higher utility to the
              customers than a perfectly competitive  retail market. Under these conditions,
              perfect retail  competition is "destructive" in the sense of yielding lower 
              economic welfare than resale price maintenance.  The project is important
              because it attempts to explian the  organization of retail markets. The results
              from the study  promise to give us a better understanding of pricing 
              "processes" beyond the traditional view of price  competition.
