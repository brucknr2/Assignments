Abstract    :
                This project conducts research on the design, definition, and  implementation
              of programming languages, with emphasis on type  structure and on  bridging the
              gap between functional and  imperative programming.  In studying  how to
              implement the  programming language Forsythe, it investigates better  methods
              of  type checking for intersection types.  Considerable improvement  is 
              expected from using a top-down rather than the present bottom-  up algorithm. 
              A  more flexible approach to the implementation  of procedures is also 
              investigated, where a portion of the  procedure body is compiled into closed 
              code while the rest of the  body is compiled into inline code at each call
              site.  This is  expected to substantially alleviate the overhead associated
              with  call  by name.    The research seeks to unify two of the intractable
              dichotomies  that  complicate and divide the study of programming languages. 
              The goal is to unify  semantics based on domains, which permits  partial and
              infinite computations,  with semantics based on  partial equivalence relations
              and intuitionistic type  theory,  which is limited to always-terminating
              computations.  Also  investigated is the unification of earlier work on the
              syntactic  control of  interference in Algol-like languages with the more 
              recent development of  low-level functional languages based on  linear logic. 
              In particular, this  research would connect the  concept of passive types with
              the modal operators of  linear  logic.
