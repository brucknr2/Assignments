Abstract    :
                Query Optimization refers to the selection of an efficient  execution strategy
              for database queries posed in declarative  languages, as typified by SQL.  The
              design of successful query  optimizers for sequential processing has
              contributed significantly  to the success of relational database systems. 
              However, current  solutions to the problem of query optimization for parallel 
              executions are inadequate  4  and limit the potential success of  database
              systems on parallel machines.  This project is concerned  with the design an
              implementation of parallelizing query  optimizers.    There are two basic
              challenges in the design of parallelizing query  optimizers.  The first is the
              design of near-accurate cost models  that predict the time it takes to complete
              the parallel execution  of an execution strategy.  The second is the design of
              reasonably  efficient search algorithms which search for the plan with the 
              minimum cost.
