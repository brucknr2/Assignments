Abstract    :
              9409268  Chai  This is a Research Initiation Award to study the damage 
              characterization of structural elements and systems  subjected to seismic
              loading.  Several damage indices have  been proposed and are being used in the
              earthquake  engineering community.  However, these are based on  initiative
              rationale and unverified assumptions.  This  project will examine the
              applicability and consistency of  various currently used damage indices based
              on experimental  work.  Several specimens will be prepared, both with 
              symmetric and asymmetric lateral load deformation  characteristics, and tested
              under monotonic, cyclic and  randomly sequenced cyclic loadings.  The
              calculated damage  indices will be compared with the observed values.  If the 
              currently used damage indices are found inadequate to  represent the
              experimentally observed behavior, the new  methods to calculate damage indices
              will be developed.  ***
