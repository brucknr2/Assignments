Abstract    :
              9409630  Caballero  This research will study the process by which firms adjust 
              to new conditions and renovate the institutions and  constraints that
              accelerate and depress such a process. The  study is divided into three parts.
              The first part develops a  microeconomic model of investment with fixed costs
              and it  examines how firms adjust to micro-level shocks, and have  different
              time-varying adjustment costs. This part of the  study uses U.S. investment
              data at the sectoral level to  examine how firms adjust their employment
              levels. The second  part of the study develops a model of creative destruction.
               Creative destruction refers to a setting where the loss of  jobs and plant
              closings involve inefficiencies due to  externalities in job search and
              externalities due to changes  in production techniques. The third part of the
              reserarch  focuses on the diffusion of ideas and their contribution to 
              economic growth. The main goal is to generate empirical  estimates of the
              impact of knowledge spillovers on  research's productivity and economic growth.
                    This study is of significant interest because it  provides results that
              improves our understanding of how a  wide range of labor market inefficiencies
              could affect  sectoral restructuring and reallocation of resources from 
              shrinking industries to growing industries, among other  things.
