Abstract    :
                The purpose of this research is to gain a better understanding of  the
              interrelated dynamics of human capital formation and changes  in the wage
              structure.  Wage inequality in the U.S. has been  rising for the past twenty
              years.  This project asks whether  inequality will continue to rise or whether
              increased education  and job training will reduce the returns to a more
              long-run  levels.    The project consists of three empirical tasks:  (1)
              Detecting and  estimating responses of investments in post-secondary education,
               measured by enrollments, and in job training to changes in rates  of return to
              human capital as measured by skill differentials in  wages.  (2) Estimating the
              effects of the accumulation human  capital measured by educational attainment
              on skill wage  differentials.  (3) Enrollment responses and attainment effects 
              are separated by a lag to be estimated statistically.  The  econometric
              analysis will utilize micro-data from the Current  Population Survey, the
              National Longitudinal Survey, and the  National Center for Education
              Statistics, as well as special  surveys of the Bureau of Labor Statistics and
              the Educational  Testing Service.
