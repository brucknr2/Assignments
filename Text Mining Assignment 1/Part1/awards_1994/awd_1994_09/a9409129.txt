Abstract    :
              9409129       This project is undertaken in conjunction with the  linguistic and
              cultural preservation effort of two Native  American tribes -- the Smith River
              Rancheria of Northern  California (Tolowa), and the Siletz of Western Oregon
              (Tututni).  The language of these two kin tribes is on the verge of 
              extinction. We will provide the first systematic description of  the
              Tolowa-Tututni language, including dictionary, reference  grammar and story
              collection. As part of the project, we will  provide graduate linguistics
              training to one tribal member from  the Smith River Rancheria (Tolowa). This
              training will enable him  to serve both reservations in their language and
              culture  preservation and education programs.       A reliable lexical and
              grammatical description of Tolowa  will be very useful to comparative
              Athabaskan linguists and  ethnographers. It will also be useful for our general
               understanding of the balance between natural/internal linguistic  change
              ('drift') and contact induced change.
