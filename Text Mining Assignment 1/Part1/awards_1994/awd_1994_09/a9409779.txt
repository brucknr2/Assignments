              Abstract  ATM-9409779  Dunbar, Robert B.  William Marsh Rice University  Title:
              Recent Climate Variability in the Western Indian Ocean and  East Africa:
              Exploring the Potential of Isotopic Records in Kenyan  Corals    This SGER
              award supports the collection and geochemical analysis of  coral cores from the
              reefs of Kenya.  In this region, monsoon winds  drive seasonal reversals in
              surface ocean currents.  The associated  movement, breakup, and reformation of
              the Intertropical Convergence  Zone (ITCZ) imposes two rainy seasons each year.
               Interannual to  decadal changes in the ocean-atmosphere of this region (e.g.
              winds,  rainfall, surface currents and temperature, thermocline depth)  relate
              closely to large-scale climate systems, notably the Indian  monsoon and the El
              Nino/Southern Oscillation.  Coral geochemical  records have the potential to
              document such variability over the  past several centuries with near-monthly
              resolution.  This project  will explore the feasibility of developing such
              long-term records.
