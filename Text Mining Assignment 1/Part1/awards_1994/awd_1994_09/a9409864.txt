Abstract    :
              This project develops an innovative approach to all-optical TDM  communications
              in multiprocessor systems.  The proposed approach is  an extension of a
              previously developed connection paradigm for  reducing control latency in
              reconfigurable optical interconnection  networks.  Using the proposed approach,
              a connection is established  during a set of tome slots along the path which
              are dependent on  each other, so that no time-slot interchanging is required
              and  simple switching devices can be used.  As a result, the overall 
              communication latency as well as the complexity of the network can  be reduced.
               Thus, a near term impact of this research is on the  design of
              high-performance, low-complexity optical interconnection  networks suitable for
              multiprocessor systems.  The research also  has long-term impact on the
              advancement of technologies such as  Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and
              Wavelength-Division  Multiplexing (WDM) as the emerging technologies for
              computer  communications.
