Abstract    :
                The goal of this RPG project is to address the perception of equiluminant
              motion and to ask how eye movements affect perception.  In addition, there will
              be a test of a model of equiluminant motion which suggests that perceptual
              processing of equiluminant motion depends both on information in the retinal
              image and on information concerning eye movements.  This work will contribute
              to the development of basic understanding of motion processing in ways that
              will allow for more generalized models of human performance, and will help lead
              to better predictions about human performance and will provide information for
              the design of displays as well.
