              programs of the Erie County Technical Institute to serve 14 counties in
              Pennsylvania.  It will use the faculty and facilities of local colleges in the
              Penn State system, local work force counseling services, and will develop a
              distance learning network for the participating rural counties.  Industry
              personnel from local firms will serve as trainers.  Short courses for workers
              as well as two- and four-year degree programs in manufacturing will be
              available in an area serving 10,000 workers and 500 firms.  ***
