Abstract    :
              9409115  Gilman       The scope of research involves topological and geometric 
              studies of Kleinian groups. This will include designing  computational
              algorithms to investigate complexity for certain  classes of such groups. The
              relationship with the theory of  Riemann surfaces and Teichmueller spaces will
              also be pursued.  ***
