Abstract    :
              9409925  Sadra  The P.I. propose a new approach to in-situ patterning in II-V
              MBE.  The P.I. propose to use thermal etch-back, the reverse of the growth
              process, as an additional degree of freedom in designing the fabrication
              sequence.  Furthermore, we will pattern this etch-back process in-situ. 
              Although several attempts at in-vacuu patterning in MBE have been made, 10-12
              the techniques used require complex and expensive multiple-chamber systems and
              do not offer the full process simplification of a single-chamber in-situ
              technique.  Here, the P.I. propose to  develop the capability to perform
              growth, patterning, etching, and overgrowth, in one chamber, all in a fully
              automated manner and without removing the substrate from its growth position. 
              The P.I. will employ two approaches to producing the pattern, depending on the
              desired minimum feature size.  For applications requiring resolution no smaller
              than a few microns, we will use a laser scanning system.  For fabrication of
              quantum wires and dots we will attempt to use natural patterning properties to
              produce a patterned etch-back mask.  Each of these techniques offers its own
              possibilities and challenges, with the latter having a more exploratory nature
              than the former.  ***
