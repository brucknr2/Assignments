Abstract    :
                      Collaborative Research Proposal      Buettner/Cassimeris     The aim of
              this research is to develop a quantitative framework for characterizing
              microtubule dynamics and assessing their contribution to neurite extension and
              growth cone motility.  The experiments to be done will combine both an
              experimental and theoretical approach.  Taking advantage of the expertise of
              Dr. Cassimeris in imaging fluorescently labelled tubulin in growth cones, the
              first series of experiments will generate a time series of video images of the
              assembly of microtubules from labelled tubulin and this will be compared with a
              similar analysis of the dynamic patterns of microtubule behavior in living
              growth cones.  The theoretical expertise of Dr. Buettner will then allow for
              the construction of a quantitative theoretical model of the contribution of
              microtubule assembly to neurite growth and motility.  This particular
              combination of an engineering approach to modelling with state of the art cell
              biological experiments will yield significant insights into our understanding
              of the relationships between microtubule dynamics and growth cone mobility
              during the developement of the nervous system.
