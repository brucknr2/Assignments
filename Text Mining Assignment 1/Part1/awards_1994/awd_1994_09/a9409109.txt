Abstract    :
              CTS-9409109  Prem Saint    The California State University in Fullerton will
              lead this effort to retrain some of Southern California's laid-off defense
              engineers to provide industry with "green" engineers versed in environmentally
              sound products and processes.  The project will train twenty-five to thirty
              engineers each year on environmentally sound products and processes.  These
              engineers will undergo a six month immersion in environmental seminars followed
              by six month "externships" at firms in environmentally sensitive industries
              that may eventually hire them.
