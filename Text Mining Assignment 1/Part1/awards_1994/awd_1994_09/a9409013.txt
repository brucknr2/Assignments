Abstract    :
              9409013  Lee  This project is to develop and implement a plan within the 
              framework of the US-China Earthquake Protocol program, to  exchange researchers
              between the two countries.  It has been  recognized that exchange of research
              personnel is an  effective way to upgrade the level of the joint research 
              program.  Both sides agree that the exchange, which has been  postponed for
              some time, be initiated during 1994.    The proposed exchange shall include
              both the short-term  (less than half a year) and long-term (about one year) 
              visits by researchers to each side.  Each side shall plan to  send one to four
              researchers to the opposite side's  universities or other research institutions
              involved to take  part in the joint research work.    The National Center for
              Earthquake Engineering Research has  a wealth of  past experiences in areas of
              international  cooperation.  NCEER will provide assistance to the National 
              Science Foundation Earthquake Hazard Mitigation Program to  organize and
              coordinate international researchers for the  purpose of international
              cooperation, knowledge transfer and  to coordinate the visits of US and PRC
              investigators.  The  Center's administrative operations would serve as an 
              efficient and convenient base of operations to undertake  such logistical
              planning.  ***   e hejjjjjjjjjjjjj
