Abstract    :
              The proposal is directed at system level testing by developing  algorithms and
              circuit configurations which can be loaded into  FPGA's to provide
              self-testing, fault diagnostic and repair  capabilities.  Once faults in an
              FPGA have been detected and  identified, reconfiguration algorithms would then
              be used to remap  the system function into the FPGA while avoiding the existing
               faults.  It is conjectured that by using this approach, development  of
              application-specific system diagnostic software for testing the  FPGA system
              function can be avoided.
