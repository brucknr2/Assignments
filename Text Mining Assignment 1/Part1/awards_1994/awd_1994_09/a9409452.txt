Abstract    :
              9409452  Brandt-Pearce  An optical free-space or fiber communications network
              can theoretically support several terabits per second total information
              throughput.  Several possibilities of design of multi-user optical systems are
              proposed such that the bandwidth is utilized efficiently.  Code-division
              multiple-access (CDMA) has been chosen as the multiplexing scheme due to its
              flexibility and efficiency.  The thrust of this research is the design and
              subsequent analysis of all-optical modulation and demodulation techniques for
              coherent detection and incoherent detection optical CDMA.  A symbol detector
              must be implemented optically if the overall CDMA spreading gain and user
              data-rate is to remain unrestricted.  The conventional optical CDMA system
              suffers a through-put limit orders of magnitude lower than the theoretical
              limit due to its poor symbol detection algorithm (the correlation detector). 
              First, several alternative detection algorithms relying on all-optical
              processing for an incoherent (direct-detection) system are proposed that
              improve the throughput and performance without imposing an excessive hardware
              complexity.  Then several multi-user detection algorithms are proposed for a
              coherent (heterodyne) detection optical system.  Optical processing is used on
              the broadband CDMA signal, followed by an electronic symbol decision algorithm.
               The bit-error probability is approximated by using large deviations theory,
              moment space bounds, and importance sampling simulations.  ***
