Abstract    :
              This project, in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry
              Program, deals with the  mechanisms and synthetic applications of niobocene
              complexes of ketenes as oxygen transfer reagents to  nitriles, isonitriles and
              ketones.  The first two classes of substrates are converted to isocyanates (the
               conversion of the nitrile involves an alkyl group migration) and the latter to
              carboxylic acid esters, with  regiochemistry that is opposite to that seen in
              traditional Baeyer-Villiger methods.  In each case the  organometallic product
              is a vinylidene complex.  A major objective of the work is the development of a
               catalytic process for mild oxidation of the above substrates based on the
              niobocene vinylidene complex  and readily available reagents as oxygen atom
              sources.    Oxidation is one of the most important reactions in synthetic
              organic chemistry.  New methods for  selective oxidation are therefore
              important research targets.  This project has as its primary objective the 
              development of a new catalyst for the mild oxidation of several organic
              substrates.  If successful, the  method could have considerable potential in
              the synthesis of new biologically active compounds such as  drugs, pesticides,
              herbicides, etc.
