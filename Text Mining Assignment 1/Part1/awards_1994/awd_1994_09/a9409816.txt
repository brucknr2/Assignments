Abstract    :
              9409816  Stokes  A methodology is developed for improving the performance of 
              high-  speed serial manipulators by integrating their mechanical and  control
              system design. Using this technique, the robustness and  accuracy of
              high-performance manipulators is increased and the  required control authority
              is decreased. The method incorporates  a combination of mechanical and control
              design of spatial, rigid-  link manipulators having joint and transmission
              compliances such  as used in automated assembly of mechanical and electrical 
              systems. An assessment of improvement is made by evaluating a  performance
              criterion which measures the system performance over  the entire workspace of
              the manipulators.  ***
