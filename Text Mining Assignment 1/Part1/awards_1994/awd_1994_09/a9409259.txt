Abstract    :
              9409259  Pinsky       It is generally accepted that all nuclear matter is
              composed  of quarks held together by the exchange of gluons.  The theory  that
              describes these interactions is known as quantum  chromodynamics or QCD.  While
              the broadest outlines of this  theory are known, many important details are yet
              to be  understood.  One of the leading approaches to a more refined 
              understanding employs a technique, pioneered in the 60's, known  as light front
              field theory (LFFT).       The fifth annual workshop on LFFT applied to QCD
              will be  held this summer in Telluride, Colorado bringing together for two 
              weeks from around the world the leading workers in this area.       The
              discussions will certainly be lively and will, in  particular, significantly
              affect the research focus of the many  students in attendance.  The workshop is
              likely to lead to  significant progress in our understanding of QCD.  ***
