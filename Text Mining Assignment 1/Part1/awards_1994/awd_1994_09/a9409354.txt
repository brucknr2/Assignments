Abstract    :
              9409354  Sargent    This research agenda addresses important unresolved problems
              in  empirical macroeconomics: aggregate consumption, asset prices,  and the
              term structure of returns, as well as the price level  impacts of various
              combinations of monetary and fiscal policy.   In addition, it includes
              theoretical work analyzing regime  switches in a fully dynamic model and how
              theoretical learning  models should be integrated into empirical research.     
                More specifically, this project applies and extends dynamic  econometric
              theories of consumption and investment to include  multiple durable consumption
              goods, habits, heterogeneity across  household "technologies," a parametric
              version of risk-  sensitivity, and economies with long but finitely lived 
              overlapping generations of people.  The project studies  aggregation across
              households with habits and tastes for multiple  durable goods both in economies
              with complete and incomplete  markets.  A recurring theme is how permanent
              income types of  theory continue to surface in a variety of settings, and how
              they  can be used econometrically.  A link between permanent income  theories
              and econometric "dynamic index" models will be exploited  for estimation and
              forecasting.  In an overlapping generations  application of the models, the
              project estimates some of the  costs and benefits that would be associated with
              a transition  from an unfunded to a fully funded social security system.  The 
              project also examines a class of monetary models that promise to  broaden the
              range of evidence than can be brought to bear on  distinguished the quantity
              theory of money from one of its main  competitors, the "real bills" theory.
