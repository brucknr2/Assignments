Abstract    :
              9409513  Tasch       This is an Engineering Deployment Teaching Initiative grant
              in   the field of compliant motion control and robotic assembly.  MATLAB  
              computer simulations will be used to illustrate problems in robotic   assembly,
              which require high positioning accuracy and low contact   forces.  These are
              conflicting requirements for conventional   industrial robots.  New actuators
              have been proposed that solve   these problems.  These actuators independently
              control the position   and stiffness of a joint.  To enhance the teaching of
              robotics,   computer simulations and graphical interfaces will be made  
              available to students.       This activity is expected to lead to improved
              engineering   education in the field of robotics.
