Abstract    :
              9409939  Kipke  This Research Initiation Award proposes involved  understanding
              of speech processing in the elaborate neural  circuits of the lower auditory
              system and to apply this  understanding to improving cochlear implants.  The 
              objectives are to develop computer models of the cochlear  nucleus to explore
              central auditory processing.  The  specific aims are to: (1)  identify
              anatomical and  physiological parameters that are critical for single-cell 
              responses to tones, noise, and speech using detailed models  of the cochlear
              nucleus primary types of neurons, (2)  identify parameters that are critical
              for describing the  functional connectivity in the cochlear nucleus using 
              network models, and (3) investigate the effects of reduced  cochlear function
              on the processing in the cochlear nucleus.  ***
