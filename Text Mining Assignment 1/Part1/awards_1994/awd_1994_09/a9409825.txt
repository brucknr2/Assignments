Abstract    :
              The primary objective of the proposed research is to investigate the use of
              light scattering for the measurement of instantaneous temperatures in rapid
              thermal reactors.  Rayleigh light scattering systems have been used for
              measurement of temperature and concentration in combustion studies previously. 
              This non-invasive optical technique measures the intensity of light scattered
              by gas molecules at a point.  From the intensity measurement, gas molecular
              density can be determined and used to evaluate temperature.  An optical system
              for temperature measurement is presented with a cylindrical control volume of
              diameter 0.125 mm and 0.5 mm length.  An uncertainty analysis demonstrates that
              temperature can indeed be measured by the system with a high degree of
              accuracy.  An impinging jet type rapid thermal processing test section will be
              built.  Temperature measurements in the reactor test section will be performed
              using the Rayleigh scattering system.  Velocity measurements will be
              accomplished by Laser-Doppler Velocimeter.  Because transient temperature
              measurements are possible, conditions which lead to thermal instabilities can
              be identified.
