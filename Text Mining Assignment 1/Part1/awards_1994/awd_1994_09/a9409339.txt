Abstract    :
                9409339  Goldberg  This research is an empirical investigation of the nature 
              and degree of competition in international markets. The main  objective is to
              use information about firm behavior in  response to large exchange rate
              variations of the post  Bretton Woods era so as to test explicit models of
              market  structure. Special attention is given to the existence of  trade policy
              restrictions, and the effect these restrictions  may have on the nature of
              competition. The empirical  analysis will use customs declaration data on the
              annual  value and quantity of exports from several sources to  various
              destinations for selected industries.       This project is of significant
              interest because it  provides a broad  empirical assessment of the effects of 
              alternative trade and regulatory policies and will inform  the design of better
              ones. The results from the study  promise to give us a better understanding of
              the impact of  antidumping regulations, the effectiveness of export  quantity
              restrictions, and the optimal strategic trade  policies under imperfect
              competition.
