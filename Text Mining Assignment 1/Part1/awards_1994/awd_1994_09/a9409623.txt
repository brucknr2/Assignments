Abstract    :
              IBN-9409623  Ruthann Nichols    Over the past few decades researchers have
              discovered numerous peptides present in the central nervous systems of
              vertebrates and invertebrates. These peptides are referred to as neuropeptides.
              Frequently similar neuropeptides are found in widely divergent species of both
              invertebrates and in vertebrates. While the function of a few of these
              neuropeptides has been determined, very little is known about the role that the
              vast majority of neuropeptides play in the nervous system. The goal of this
              research project is to determine the physiological function of a neuropeptide
              called sulfakinin in the fruitfly, Drosophila. Sulfakinin is very similar to
              another peptide, cholecystokinin, that is found in the brains of vertebrates.
              The fruitfly is an excellent animal in which to do these studies because it is
              possible to look at Drosophila that have mutations in the genes that code for
              the neuropeptide sulfakinin. By determining the effect these mutations have on
              the behavior of the animal, one can hope to figure out what role this
              neuropeptide plays in the central nervous system. Since similar peptides exist
              in a wide variety of animals and humans, the results of these studies will be
              applicable to those organisms as well.
