Abstract    :
              Project Summary  Hickman/ATM-9409362         This project will involve
              theoretical calculations of the  scattering of ionic and neutral atomic oxygen,
              one of the most  important collision processes in the upper atmosphere.  The 
              coupling between O+ and O (a collision frequency) plays a crucial  role in
              models of global atmospheric wind circulation and in  determining the ion
              density in the ionosphere.  There is a current  discrepancy between calculated
              values of this collision frequency  and values inferred from aeronomic
              experiments.  All previous  calculations of the frequency have ignored the
              fine-structure  splitting of atomic oxygen as well as spin-orbit and rotational
               coupling between the states of O+2 during the collision.  These  effects are
              significant and may be large enough to remove the  discrepancy.
