Abstract    :
              9409988  Houze       Many of the factors that are critical for understanding and
              predicting weather  that is disruptive to human activity occur on what
              meteorologists term the mesoscale.   Mesoscale phenomena are not well sampled
              by the operational weather network;  therefore, progress is made through
              episodic field experiments specially designed to  study mesoscale processes. 
              Most convective storms occur in organized units known  as mesoscale convective
              systems (MCSs).        The Principal Investigator has three objectives that
              will be accomplished using  a combination of  diagnostic studies and advanced
              numerical modeling:  study the  fundamental nature of the dynamics and
              microphysics of the three components of  MCSs (convective regions, transition
              region and stratiform region); study the impact  of MCSs on large scale
              circulations; continue climatological studies of  MCSs  including contrasting
              MCS structures from different geographical locations.  ***
