Abstract    :
              9409716  Zhuang       The award is for research to develop procedures for self- 
              calibration of machine tool structures based on the Stewart  Platform.  The
              research would address issues of sensor location and  desired accuracy, system
              kinematic modeling for purposes of  calibration, and the design of optimal
              alogarithms for calibration  and compensation.       The self-calibration
              technique, if successful, would be of use  to a new class of Computer
              Numerically Controlled machine tools  based on the Stewart Platform.  The
              accuracy of such machine tools  would be improved as various types of machine
              errors, including  those induced by thermal gradients and load variations, can
              be  compensated for without interrupting normal machine operation.
