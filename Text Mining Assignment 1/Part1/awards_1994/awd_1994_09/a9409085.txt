Abstract    :
              9409085  In recent experiments a remarkable range of chemical and physical 
              properties has been observed in intermediate-sized clusters of  carbon and
              silicon atoms containing between about twenty and fifty  atoms.  These
              properties are surprisingly sensitive to such details  as cluster size and
              shape, reflecting a subtle interplay between  cluster electronic states and the
              overall cluster structure.  In  this Research at Undergraduate Institution
              grant, first-principles  methods based on density functional theory will be
              used to study  the electronic states of clusters in this size range.  The
              ultimate  goals of the project are to understand how the electronic states  are
              influenced by such factors as cluster size and shape, and how  the nature of
              the cluster electronic states in turn affects other  properties of the
              clusters.  %%%  This is a Research at Undergraduate Institution award to
              conduct  theoretical research on the properties of silicon and carbon 
              clusters.  These clusters have properties which are intermediate  between those
              of the molecule and the solid.  These properties are  often unique and are
              highly dependent on the interplay between  electron states and cluster shape. 
              This research will conduct  calculations of these electronic states and their
              effect on cluster  properties.  The work will be done in collaboration with the
              Naval  Research Laboratory.
