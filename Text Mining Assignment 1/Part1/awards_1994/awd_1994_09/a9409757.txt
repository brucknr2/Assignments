              Economic   Research and it focuses on measurement needs, accounting procedures,
                and research issues of current interest to international economic analysts
              and policy makers.  The aim of the organizers of the conference is to commision
              research papers dealing with basic   methodological questions in international
              economics, and data collection and economic measurement issues identified along
              regional  geography and nationality of ownership.  This conference is important
               because it provides new and improved international data that would be   used
              to shed more light on a number of international economic issues,  such as,
              regional economic agreements, industrial policies  foreign-investor policies,
              and regional development policies.
