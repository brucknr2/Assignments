Abstract    :
              Recent advances in computing technology and data availability  have sharply
              reduced the cost of real-time forecasting of the  economy using large numbers
              of time series data.  At the same  time, there is considerable evidence that
              economic forecasting  systems have had significant episodes of instability, a
              recent  example being the poor performance of most models entering the  1990 to
              1991 recession and the subsequent slow recovery.  The  purpose of this research
              is to develop and analyze forecasting  methodologies when predictive
              relationships are changing over  time.  Several large data and rich data sets
              will be used to  assess the performance of various adaptive forecasting
              systems.   These include data from the postwar U.S., data from the U.S.  before
              World War II, and data from Canada and Israel.  This  research is important
              because it holds the promise of improving  significantly economic forecasting. 
              An important application  would be in the area of improving long-term energy
              forecasting  and assessing global environmental change.
