Abstract    :
               This project focuses on the development of efficient  algorithms  for graphs
              that have small separators.  The goal is to explore  the  particular topology
              of the graphs in order to improve the  efficiency of the  algorithms.  One
              important class of graphs that is investigated is the class of  planar graphs,
              which arise  naturally in applications dealing with regions in  the plane.  The
               following types of problems are addressed:   (1) Finding  shortest paths and
              distances in graphs:  This is a fundamental and well  studied problem in
              computer science with many applications.  The problems  considered here include
              the design of dynamic and on-line algorithm for the  single-source and the
              all-pairs shortest paths problems for graphs with  weights on the edges;  (2)
              Locating the center and computing the diameter   of an outer planar graph: 
              Such problems find important applications in the  design and analysis of
              communication networks;  (3) Graph separation problems:  Graph separator
              theorems and the corresponding algorithms are important tools  in the efficient
              solution of various combinatorial problems.  Algorithms for  finding separators
              of small cost for special classes of graphs are  constructed, where the cost of
              the separator depends on some previously  specified cost function on the edges
              of the graph.
