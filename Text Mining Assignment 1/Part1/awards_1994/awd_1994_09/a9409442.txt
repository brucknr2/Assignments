Abstract    :
              Support is sought to purchase a UNIX-based server to provide storage and
              computational support for the Earth Science  Laboratory (EESL) within the
              Department of Geosciences at Northeastern University (NLU).  The EESL is a
              modern teaching  and research facility which allows users to integrate
              meteorological, geological, and geographical data using UNIDATA and  geographic
              information systems (GIS) software.  This request is one of three proposals to
              establish the ESSL.  In addition  to the UNIDATA program, proposals were sent
              to the State of Louisiana, private donators and the NSF ILI program.  The 
              other (non-UNIDATA) proposals have been successful.  The PIs consider the
              UNIDATA request as the final phase of their  effort.  The server will allow the
              ESSL to operate efficiently and be connected to the internet.  Using the
              requested  equipment, NLU plans to act as a second level node to distribute
              real time data to the UNIDATA community.
