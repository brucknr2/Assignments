Abstract    :
              9409009  Eichenbaum    This project describes a research agenda in applied
              business  cycle analysis.  The topics to be analyzed fall into five broad 
              categories.  The first category concerns work aimed at  empirically
              characterizing the effects of monetary policy shocks  on aggregate economic
              activity and the borrowing and lending  activities of different sectors in the
              US economy.  The second  category involves building structural models of the
              monetary  transmission mechanism which have the potential to account for  the
              features of the data documented in the first stage of the  project.  The third
              category of research topics concerns the role  of time varying capital
              utilization rates and other forms of  factor hording as propagation mechanisms
              in the business cycle.   The fourth category of research concerns the
              development of  econometric methods for estimating and assessing the empirical 
              plausibility of structural business cycle models.  The focus here  will be on
              analyzing the small sample properties of Generalized  Method of Moments
              procedures.  Finally, the fifth category of  research investigates the
              operating characteristics and welfare  properties of different monetary policy
              rules using the class of  structural monetary models developed in previous
              phases of the  research program.  Particular attention will be paid to rules 
              which smooth nominal interest rates.
