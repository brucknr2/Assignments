Abstract    :
                           The regulation of the outgrowth of nerve processes, and their
              guidance to appropriate targets, is an important element of the developmental
              program responsible for generating the circuitry of the adult nervous system. 
              During development the tips of neuronal processes, the growth cones, undergo a
              period of rapid outgrowth.  Unknown at this time, however, are the mechanisms
              that initiate the transition to the rapid outgrowth phase.  The preliminary
              result that form the basis for this research is the finding that a specific
              enzyme accumulates at a high level in the growth cone just prior to the onset
              of rapid outgrowth.  The studies that will be performed are designed to
              determine if this enzyme induces the nerve process to undergo outgrowth, and
              the possible mechanisms whereby this induction occurs.  The results will be of
              fundamental importance in understanding the processes that are involved in
              guiding the processes of nerve cells to their appropriate targets during
              development.
