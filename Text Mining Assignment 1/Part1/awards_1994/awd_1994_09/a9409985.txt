Abstract    :
              9409985  Tu       The award is for the development of motorized, ball-bearing, 
              high-speed spindles with active bearing thermal load monitoring and 
              regulation, and with adequate spindle stiffness maintained  throughout a wider
              operating speed range as compared to current  practice.  Techniques to
              characterize, monitor, and regulate the  bearing thermal load will be developed
              and result in design  improvements and better spindle operation.       The
              results of the work would be of use to the aerospace and  automobile industries
              which have employed high-speed machining.   Advances in spindle technology
              resulting from this work would  complement advances in cutting tool materials
              and result in  improved productivity.
