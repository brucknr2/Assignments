Abstract    :
              9409451  Shapiro      Neoinstitutional approaches to the study of legislatures
              have  developed a range of formal models that explain the purpose of 
              congressional rules and procedures.  However, this formal work  has rarely been
              integrated with the empirical research on  congressional reform.  This
              dissertation research project will  extend existing distributive, informational
              and partisan models  of legislative structure into explanations of
              congressional  transformations, especially the structure and composition of 
              committees and their jurisdictions.  Since the models provide  divergent
              explanations for the endurance of institutions,  propositions derived from
              these new theories should predict  different empirical outcomes with respect to
              the restructuring of  the congressional committee system.  The student will
              examine the  explanatory power of these theories, using empirical evidence on 
              congressional reform in the House of Representatives in order to  compare the
              effectiveness of each in explaining alterations in  the committee system and
              jurisdictional boundaries since the  Cannon Revolt of 1910.  Findings from the
              examination of these  models will give indications as to when and why different
              types  of jurisdictional reform and committee restructuring have  occurred. 
              The results will also offer insights into which  approach to legislative
              structure most accurately captures the  motivations and behavior of members
              within the constantly  evolving institution of congress.
