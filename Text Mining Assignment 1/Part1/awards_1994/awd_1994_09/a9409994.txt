Abstract    :
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports  the membrane-mimetic
              studies of Professor Fendler at  Syracuse University. The studies focus on the 
              preparation and characterization of metallic and  semiconducting nanoparticles
              and films in aqueous  solutions, in surfactant vesicles, under aqueous 
              monolayers, and at air-water interfaces. Studies will  also be conducted on the
              transfer of the nanoparticles  and films onto solid substrates as well as on
              the  incorporation between headgroups of Langmuir-Blodgett  films. The
              different systems will be characterized in  and ex situ by a variety of
              physico-chemical techniques  amongst which atomic force microscopy.    In this
              project Dr. Fendler will conduct membrane-  mimetic studies aimed at the
              preparation and  characterization of metallic, magnetic, and  semiconducting
              nanoparticles and films in aqueous media  and vesicles. These investigations
              will provide the  much needed and necessary information for the  development of
              a "wet colloid-chemical" approach to the  construction of advanced materials.
