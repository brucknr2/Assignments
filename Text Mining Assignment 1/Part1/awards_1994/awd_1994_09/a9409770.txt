Abstract    :
              The incorporation of constraint technology in programming  languages, although
              very recent, is a promising and effective tool  for the development of software
              solutions to problems with complex  modeling requirements. This research
              incorporates  successful  constraint technology (involving linear inequalities,
              linear  programming, finite domains, and incremental constraint  maintenance)
              with database technology, in a new framework of Linear  Constraint Databases. 
              These Linear Constraint Databases are  motivated by and aimed at a number of
              application domains that  require large persistent storage and are
              characterized by (1)  spatio-temporal features, (2) constraint-based design and
              planning,  and (3) large-scale (usually linear programming) optimization and 
              analysis.  The challenge in the proposed research involves  achieving both
              efficient and declarative querying of large data  sets involving constraints. 
              A successful integration of constraint  programming techniques with
              object-oriented or relational database  systems is possible, given the current
              programming and database  state-of-the-art. Also, it is challenging, given the
              demands for  efficiency and high level specification.     The impact of a
              successful integration could be significant in a  number of important
              application areas. Moreover, it has the  potentialto be an integral part of a
              new eneration of database  management systems.
