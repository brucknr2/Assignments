Abstract    :
              9409025  jahnke  An analytical investigation is carried out for the stability
              and  maneuverability of aircrafts subjected to large perturbations.  The
              stall/spin phenomena lead to catastrophic accidents under  such large inputs.
              The divergence often occurs when the cruise  condition becomes unstable due to
              bifurcation of the steadystates  of the aircraft, with the result that the
              aircraft jumps to a new  steady state or limit cycle that represents a spin
              condition. The  stability analysis is performed via a liapunov function using 
              total energy of the aircraft as a guide for constructing such  functions. A
              continuation technique is used to compute specific  level curves which define
              the basin of attraction of the steady  state. The analytical technique is quite
              general, and applicable  for stability analysis of a variety of nonlinear
              dynamical  systems.  ***
