Abstract    :
              9409835  Shin    The past decade has seen a growth in major research efforts 
              dedicated to the examination of popular support for democratic  transformations
              of authoritarian rule.  Teams of political  scientists and sociologists have
              conducted national sample  surveys of the mass publics of newly democratizing
              countries in  Est Asia, Eastern and Southern Europe, and Latin America.  From 
              these surveys, much is known about levels, trends, and sources of  mass support
              for democracy.  From the surveys, however, there is  little known about the
              dynamics of mass support for  democratization.    Which segments of the mass
              citizenry have continued supporting  democratization?  Which segments have
              discontinued their support  of it?  What has motivated some to modify their
              democratic  support?  Undoubtedly these questions are crucial to formulating 
              an appropriate strategy for consolidating nascent democratic  rule.  Yet these
              questions have not been addressed adequately in  the large body of literature
              which has recently accumulated on  the mass culture of democratization.    This
              research investigation seeks to address these questions of  strategic
              significance from the perspective of life quality which  ordinary citizens
              experience and envision for themselves and  their country.  Specifically, the
              study hypothesizes that  individual citizens react to democratization in
              response to their  perceptions of how it has affected the quality of their life
              in  the past and their expectations of how it would affect the  quality of
              their life in the future.  This hypothesis will be  tested with a new set of
              mass survey data to be collected from  Korea, a country which has made
              considerable progress in  establishing a democratic political culture over the
              past five  years.
