Abstract    :
              9409551  Vassiolos Papadopoulos    Steroid hormones, derived from cholesterol,
              are responsible for the maintenance of the organism's homeostasis, adaptability
              to the environment and developmental and reproductive functions.  The brain is
              one target tissue of steroids, where they regulate neuronal function.  Most of
              the steroids present in the brain originate from gonads and adrenals.  However,
              recent studies, including those of Dr. Papadopoulos, demonstrated that some
              brain structures have the ability to synthesize specific steroids which could
              directly and locally regulate brain function.  These studies are to:  1)
              investigate where and when steroid synthesis occurs in the brain, 2) find out
              which steroids are synthesized by different brain structures, and 3) examine
              how brain steroid synthesis is regulated.  For these studies rats of different
              ages, from fetus to adult will be used.  Once the most active steroid producing
              brain cell populations are localized, various factors known to control brain
              function will be examined to determine whether these factors could also
              regulate neuro-steroid synthesis.
