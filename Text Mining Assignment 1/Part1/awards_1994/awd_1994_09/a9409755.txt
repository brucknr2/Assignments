Abstract    :
              Bailar, Barbara  SBR-9409755    This award provides partial support for the
              Federal Statistics Fellowship Program, a program organized by the American
              Statistical Association that brings academic researchers into the Bureau of the
              Census, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the National Center for Education
              Statistics to work with statisticians and social scientists for up to one year.
               The primary objective of the program is to foster collaborative and
              interdisciplinary research efforts that will stimulate the development of
              methodology and social science research relevant to issues on which federal
              statistical agencies provide information.    This program, which began in the
              late 1970's, has been a success for both the academic community and the federal
              agencies.  The benefits to these communities include: (1) research generated by
              access to data and other resources that are not available outside the
              particular government agencies, (2) improvements in federal statistics, which
              are used by academic researchers and others, and (3) the discovery of
              methodological and other research problems relevant to public policies.
