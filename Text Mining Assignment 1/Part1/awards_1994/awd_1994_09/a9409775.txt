Abstract    :
              9409775 Dean       This project is concerned with a solution of the Jacobian 
              Conjecture.  The principal investigator describes a new approach  for verying
              the conjecture in dimension two.  The ideas eminate  from work on the
              relationship between the Jacobian Conjecture and  the Kirillov-Dixmier
              Conjecture for the first Weyl algebra.  An  extension of this approach to
              higher dimensions is also  discussed.       It is well known that an invertible
              polynomial map on a  complex affine space has a jacobian which is a nonzero
              constant.   The Jacobian Conjecture asserts the converse: a polynomial map 
              with a jacobian which is a nonzero constant is invertible.  In  spite of the
              vast amount of attention which it has attracted over  the last fifty years, the
              Jacobian Conjecture remains open in  every dimension greater than one.  This
              award supports work on a  novel approach to this problem.
