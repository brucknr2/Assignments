Abstract    :
              9409794     Hiatt    American Academy of Arts and Sciences  Exploring for
              Consensus on Major Programs in Education    The American Academy of Arts and
              Sciences will convene a national  conference entitled Exploring for Consensus
              on Major Programs in  Education.  This two and one-half day conference builds
              on the  Initiatives for Children efforts to develop ties among researchers, 
              practitioners and policy makers working for systemic reforms in  education. 
              Although not exclusively tied to mathematics and  science, the conference has
              the purpose of improving the quality of  teaching and instruction in secondary
              schools.  The expectation is  that the stature and expertise of the assembled
              group will result  in recommendations of national import and that the stature
              of the  Academy will insure wide interest in the dissemination of the 
              findings.      Fifteen to twenty participants drawn form all regions and
              related  interests are expected to attend.  A document representing the 
              consensus of the participants will be available to all groups  concerned with
              secondary education ranging from policy-setting  agencies to individual
              classroom teachers.     Although some expenses are absorbed by the center,
              there is no  specific commitment to cost sharing.  ***
