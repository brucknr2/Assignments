Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry program of the  
              Chemistry Division, R.S. Berry will study Penning detachment, a process   in
              which a free, gaseous negative ion releases an electron as a result of   a
              collision with an electronically excited neutral atom or molecule.  The  
              project is a collaboration of two institutions, The University of Chicago   and
              the Heyrovsky Institute for Physical Chemistry in the Czech Republic.    The
              Chicago experiments will be done with laser excitation of neutrals,   while the
              Prague experiments will use electron impact excitation and   subsequent
              electron energy analysis.  Initially atomic ion and neutral   collisions will
              establish the proof of principal.  Later experiments will   move to simple
              molecules as donors and targets.  %%%  The Penning detachment process, which is
              analogous to Penning ionization,   is little studied but represents a new type
              of interaction between gas   phase species which may play an important role in
              chemical vapor   deposition or other plasma processes, such as take place in
              the upper   atmosphere.  As such, it has wide-ranging implications, from
              possibly   improved manufacturing processes to a better understanding of
              ionospheric   phenomena.
