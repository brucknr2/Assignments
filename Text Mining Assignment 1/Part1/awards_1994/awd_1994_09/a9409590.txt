Abstract    :
              9409590  Osheroff    Technical abstract:  Helium three will be used as a model
              system to  study various aspects of the nature of phase transitions and 
              complex order in important classes of physical systems.  Work on  superfluid
              helium three A-B phase nucleation will probe how surface  roughness increases
              the nucleation rate, possibly paving the way  for the use of this system in
              quantum tunneling studies.  Study of  the magnetic order in thr second layer
              helium three films adsorbed  on graphite will be continued.  The emphasis of
              this work is to  search for a possible finite temperature phase transition in
              low  magnetic fields for this two dimensional Heisenberg system.  Third  sound
              studies will be carried out to search for a second  superconducting state of
              sub-monolayer helium three films adsorbed  on superfluid helium four.  Finally,
              new studies of the spatial  dependence of noise correlations in spin glasses
              will be carried  out.    Non-technical abstract:  Helium three will be used as
              a model  system for studying various aspects of the nature of phase 
              transitions and complex order in important classes of physical  systems. 
              Studies of the phase transitions between two liquid  helium three phases which
              are neutral analogs to electrical  superconductors may help produce a highly
              effective particle  detector, as well shed knowledge on a broad class of phase 
              transitions in general.  Thin helium three films which exhibit  effective
              magnetic interactions between the atomic nuclei will  allow test theoretical
              predictions that thin liquid helium three  films on appropriate substrates may
              exhibit still more novel forms  of order, possibly related to those seen in the
              oxide  superconductors.  ***
