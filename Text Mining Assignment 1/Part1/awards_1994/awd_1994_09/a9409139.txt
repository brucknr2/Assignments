Abstract    :
                        9409139  Vogelmann  Functional significance has not been ascribed to
              many leaf  structural features such as palisade and spongy mesophyll.  These 
              tissues presumably optimize photosynthesis, possibly by maximizing  overlap
              between internal concentrations of light and carbon  dioxide.  The proposed
              research will examine the relationship  between leaf anatomy, internal
              gradients of light, carbon dioxide  and the distribution of photosynthetic
              activity within the leaf.   In most leaves, light enters from the top whereas
              carbon dioxide  enters primarily from the bottom where the majority of the
              stomata  occur.  This may create two opposing internal gradients, either one 
              of which may limit photosynthesis of the individual cell layers.   In turn,
              such internal limitations could influence photosynthetic  performance at the
              level of the whole-leaf.  Leaf anatomy (sun vs.  shade leaves) and the
              placement of variable numbers of stomates on  the lower and upper leaf surfaces
              (hypo- vs. amphistomy) could  influence internal limitations to light and
              carbon dioxide, and  affect whole-leaf photosynthetic performance.  By using 
              radiolabeling and microautoradiography, it is proposed to examine  more
              directly the interactions between light and gradients of  photosynthetic
              performance within the leaf.  These experiments will  comprise a first step
              towards understanding the importance of leaf  structure to photosynthetic
              performance in both agricultural and  native species.  ***
