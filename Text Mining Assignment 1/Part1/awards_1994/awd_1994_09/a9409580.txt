Abstract    :
              9409580  Honavar       The primary objectives of the proposed research is a 
              systematic exploration of a class of constructive learning  algorithms for
              neural networks for pattern classification that can  potentially:  1) Eliminate
              the need for ad-hoc, often inappropriate  choices of network architecture; 2)
              Yield close to minimal networks  whose complexity is commensurate with the
              complexity of the  particular task implicitly specified by the training data;
              3)  Provide empirical estimates of expected-case complexity of real-  world
              pattern classification tasks; 4) Offer natural ways to trade  off some
              performance measures (e.g., learning time) against others  (e.g., network
              size); 5) Provide convenient ways to incorporate  domain knowledge (when
              available) to speed up learning.
