Abstract    :
              Wave pipelining eliminates the intermediate register stages in a  pipelined
              system by using the internal capacitance of the  combinational logic for
              temporary storage.  to obtain a high  operating speed, equal path delays must
              be ensured between all the  input and the output nodes of a given functional
              block.  This  requires symmetric rise and fall times, and delay independence on
               the input patterns for each component within the functional unit.   This
              project proposes a method that uses a modified complementary  Pass-transistor
              Logic (CPL) circuits as the basic cells to  implement a high performance CMOS
              wave-pipelined system.   Preliminary research and design results show that the
              family of  basic cells, called Wave-pipelined Transmission-Gate Logic (WTGI), 
              using standard CMOS technology, can be designed to have equal  rise/fall times
              and reduced gate delay variations as compared to  other approaches.  The
              project addresses the design of a WTGL cell  library for computational and
              signal processing applications.   Further, logic synthesis and the delay tuning
              algorithms will be  developed with an emphasis towards an application i signal 
              processing.  CAD tools that can effectively use the WRGL technique  will be
              developed.
