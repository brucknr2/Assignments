Abstract    :
              9409519  Johnson       This research is aimed at developing supply chain models
              to  facilitate the analysis of the delivery performance of a product.   The
              supply chain of a product is the interdependent network of  activities from
              procurement of raw material through final  distribution.  Supply chain models
              are analytical tools for  analyzing the delivery performance of a product.  To
              buffer against  uncertainty in demand, manufacturers often hold excess
              inventory or  maintain excess capacity.  The models to be develop will analyze 
              tradeoffs between buffering with capacity and inventory.  These  models will
              aid in capacity planning and inventory control.       The outcome of this
              research will contribute to supply chain  theory through the development of
              models which reflect  manufacturing capacity limitations.  The results will
              provide some  guide to engineers and production managers in the design of
              supply  chain software.  Furthermore, knowledge will be gained as to when 
              supply chain models are applicable and how model results should be  interpreted
              by management.
