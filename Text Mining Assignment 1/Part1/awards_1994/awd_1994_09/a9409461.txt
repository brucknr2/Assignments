Abstract    :
              9409461  Franchek  In this research project a design methodology is developed 
              that deliberately uses actuator saturation to maximize the  allowable step
              disturbance size acting on a class of  uncertain regulating systems whose
              output must be maintained  within a prespecified tolerance. The approach is
              based upon  frequency-domain techniques that displays the trade-offs  between
              output performance in terms of sensitivity reduction  and controller bandwidth.
              Using this approach, it is  feasible to design linear feedback controllers that
              only  saturate for large disturbances, which offers a significant  advantage
              over the use of bang-bang control.  ***
