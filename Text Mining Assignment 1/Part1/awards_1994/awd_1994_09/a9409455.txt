Abstract    :
              9409455  Hubbell  This proposal is on research to develop biomaterials for
              tissue  engineering of the peripheral nerve.  These biomaterials are  comprised
              of fibrin gels containing synthetic matrix attachment  peptides to provide both
              neuro-conductive and neuro-inductive  stimuli in order to enhance nerve
              regeneration.  This research  has three specific aims which are: (1) to
              characterize the  stability of the immobilization of the peptides incorporated
              into  fibrin; (2) to determine the bioactivity of the incorporated  peptides;
              and (3) to examine the effect of peptide incorporation  on in vivo peripheral
              nerve generation.  This research could have  impact on the treatment of human
              neurological disease.  ***
