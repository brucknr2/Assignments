Abstract    :
              9409119  Verlinde         An integrated cloud analysis system, consisting of a
              numerical  cloud model integrated into a four-dimensional variational data 
              assimilation system will be developed for the assimilation of  radar, lidar,
              microwave radiometer, and aircraft measurements.   This analysis system will
              retrieve four-dimensional fields of wind,  temperature, pressure, and
              microphysical parameters from  Doppler/polimetric radar and other remotely
              sensed quantities.       This analysis system will be an alternative to
              currently used  dual-Doppler analysis techniques.  I avoids determining the 
              vertical velocity through integration of the continuity equation,  and also
              eliminates the stationarity assumption of dual-Doppler  analysis techniques. 
              It will be designed to assimilate multi-  parameter radar observation of the
              hydrometer on the radar observed  radial velocity fields can therefore be
              included in the analysis  without using a terminal velocity-reflectivity
              relationship.
