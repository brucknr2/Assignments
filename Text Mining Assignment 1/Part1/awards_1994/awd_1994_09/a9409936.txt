Abstract    :
                    This  is  a  project  to  study  how  individuals  and  households are
              adapting to the momentous changes underway in  rural  areas  of the former
              Soviet Union.  In  collaboration  with  researchers from the Russian Academy of
              Sciences,  the  project  team  will carry out a three wave  panel  study  of 
              residents  in  two  villages in Russia.  The  questionnaires  will be designed
              to collect extensive information about  the  social networks in which inviduals
              and families are enmeshed  in  order  to understand the role of connections and
               social  support in adapting to rapid social change.        Prior  to the
              collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991  it  was  next  to impossible for Western
              researchers to  collect  objective survey data on social life in rural Russia. 
              Since  the   downfall  of  communism  in  that  state,  rapid   and  disruptive
              changes in social and economic life are  underway  which are poorly understood.
               It is now possible for Western  researchers  to  collect systematic empirical 
              data  on  the  changes  underway,  and  there is some  urgency  to  collect 
              baseline  information before these changes  have  progressed  too  far.   By 
              carrying out three waves of surveys  in  two  contrasting  villages, this
              project will help us  understand  the  dramatic changes that are occurring in
              rural Russia and  what their likely outcomes are.
