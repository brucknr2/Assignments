Abstract    :
              9409265  Anderson  Research will be carried out in nucleon and nuclear structure
              via  electron and proton induced reactions.  Polarization transfer in 
              neutron-proton charge exchange reactions will be used to probe  the medium
              effects on the nucleon-nucleon potential.  The charge-  structure of the
              neutron will be probed in polarization transfer  studies of electron-induced
              neutron knockout reactions.  A high-  efficiency neutron polarimeter will be
              assembled and calibrated  for these purposes.  The charge exchange reactions
              will be  carried out at the Indiana University Cyclotron Facility, while 
              measurements of the neutron's charge structure will be carried  out at the
              MIT/Bates lab and at CEBAF.  Other related experiments  will also be carried
              out at these laboratories.  ***
