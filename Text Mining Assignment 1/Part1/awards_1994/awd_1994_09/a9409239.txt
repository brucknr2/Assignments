Abstract    :
              9409239  Schlecht  There is an important need for compact, lightweight,
              efficient laser systems that are tunable.  In order for these laser systems to
              achieve the output powers, efficiency, beam quality, reliability, and the small
              size and weight required, they must be solid state fiber systems.  The most
              efficient source for pumping these laser systems is the diode laser where 50%
              efficiencies are now possible.  Further, in order to efficiently couple the
              pump light from laser diodes into the laser and to efficiently extract both the
              laser output power and any heat generated, a fiber laser system is demanded. 
              LaserGenics Corporation has grown fibers of titanium doped A1203, YA103, and
              MgA1204 by the laser heated pedestal-growth technique during our Phase I
              effort.  These materials are very attractive as tunable laser sources from the
              near IR to the near UV.  During the Phase II effort we will further optimize
              the growth of MgA1204 fibers, develop cladding materials and techniques for the
              three types of single crystal fibers we have grown, construct a tunable fiber
              laser breadboard system using these fibers and test this system with these
              fibers and report these results.  ***
