Abstract    :
              9409049  Smith    This project uses a variety of time-resolved spectroscopic 
              techniques to shed some light on the dynamics of the exchange  interactions in
              II-VI semiconductors between electrons, holes and  magnetic impurities, as well
              as among the impurities themselves.   The goals of this research are the
              following:  (1) to study the  dynamics of formation and decay of exciton
              magnetic polarons in  different dimensional configurations, (2) to measure the
              relative  strength and spatial scale of the Manganese-Iron interaction in 
              Manganese doped Zinc-Selenium and Iron doped Zinc-Selenium  structure, (3) to
              measure optically the spatial diffusion of a  local perturbation of the
              magnetic spins in order to gain new  information on exchange interaction
              between the magnetic  impurities, and (4) to measure directly the effect of
              valence band  mixing on spin-relaxation rate.    %  %  %  %    The recent
              development of blue solid state lasers using Zinc-  Selenide has increased the
              need for understanding the basic physics  of elementary interactions in these
              materials.  In particular, the  basic relaxation mechanisms of highly excited
              electronic states in  these materials is directly applicable to the engineering
              of new  higher-efficiency laser-diodes.  This project will use a variety of 
              novel time-resolved optical spectroscopies to study the interaction  between
              electrons holes and magnetic impurities in wide-gap Zinc-  Selenide-based
              semiconductors.  In particular, we hope to gain  understanding on how the spins
              in these materials lose energy and  eventually form new confined states, as
              well as how the magnetic  interactions in these materials affect the transport
              properties of  electrons and holes.  ***
