Abstract    :
                  Recent trends in the relative improvements in speeds between the  Central
              Processing Unit (CPU) and Input/Output (I/O system  components suggest that the
              I/O system could become a bottleneck in  computer systems.  If this happens,
              many applications could become  so I/O-limited that increases in CPU speeds
              would no longer be  helpful.  High performance I/O systems are needed to
              address this  imbalance.  For many applications such as database systems, I/O 
              threaten to be a bottleneck limiting performance.    The proposed research will
              investigate two issues related to I/O  performance databases.  First, we will
              focus on developing and  verifying algorithms that improve the efficiency of
              random small  writes.  This type of workload dominates many on-line
              transactions  processing (OLTP) applications.  Second, we will characterize I/O
               performance in very large databases and develop a data management  model for
              improved I/O performance.  Applications such as brokerage  houses, retail
              chains and mail order houses are increasingly making  use of very large
              databases for advanced OLTP applications.    The research will be simulation
              based.  Commercial I/O traces and  I/O traces from VAX 8800 machines at the
              Florida International  University will be used as workloads for the study.
