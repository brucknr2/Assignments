Abstract    :
              This project will investigate the integration of new storage  technologies, such
              as flash RAM and helical scan tapes, into the  storage hierarchy to take
              advantage of each technology's strengths  while masking its weaknesses. 
              Ground-breaking work in disk arrays  has already been accomplished; in this
              project, the emphasis will  be on other areas of the hierarchy, such as
              solid-state memories  and magnetic tapes.  For example, this research will
              investigate  how to increase the effective capacity of solid-state memories to 
              mitigate their higher cost.  This research will take place in three  stages:
              (1) measure new storage devices and trace current I/O  workloads; (2) design
              and simulate new hierarchical architectures  and algorithms; (3) implement a
              prototype hierarchical storage  system and measure its operation under real
              use.
