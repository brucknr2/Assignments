Abstract    :
              The conceptual framework for international macroeconomic policy  analysis has
              evolved little over the past decade.  The  aggregative sticky-price model is
              still the dominant paradigm in  policy circles world wide. It underpins the
              international macro-  econometric models used by government agencies and
              international  institutions.  But even more importantly, the basic lessons of 
              these models permeate all levels of policy discussion.  While the  shortcomings
              of these models have long been recognized, academic  research has remained
              largely dormant.  There have been  significant advances in the study of
              flexible-price international  macro models over this period, but thus far these
              models have had  virtually no policy impact. It is understandable that policy 
              makers are reluctant to ignore the familiar sticky-price models  simply because
              they are out of fashion among theorists.    The goal of this project is to
              incorporate new models of price  rigidities into an explicitly intertemporal
              framework that can  adequately account for the long and short run effects of
              current  account imbalances, government fiscal deficits, and their impacts  on
              other macroeconomic variables.  The resulting analytical  framework offers a
              fresh perspective on a broad range of  international economic issues, including
              exchange rate  overshooting, optimum currency areas, the fiscal-monetary mix, 
              and strategic aspects of policy interdependence.
