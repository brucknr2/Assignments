Abstract    :
              9409843  Peters    In 1992, record numbers of women successfully won seats in
              the  U.S. Congress and in state legislatures, making these  institutions more
              descriptively representative of society.   Previous research points to policy
              differences between female and  male officeholders.  Largely unexplored,
              however are questions  about the institutional impact and political leadership
              styles of  women.  The steady rise in number and the increasing tenure of 
              women in state legislatures now make these questions accessible.    This
              Doctoral Dissertation research project seeks to explore the  experiences of
              women committee chairs in the 50 state  legislatures.  The objectives revolve
              around three questions:   First, do female committee chairs differ in
              background,  leadership behavior , and outlook from their male counterparts?  
              Second, how are gender-related leadership styles expressed in  different
              settings?  Third, as women increase their  representation, do gender styles
              transform institutions?    The 343 women chairing state legislative committees
              represent an  important and sizeable leadership cohort to study.  This 
              investigation will contribute not only to gender insights but  also to
              knowledge of leadership behavior in legislative  committees and
              cross-jurisdictional generalizations.    The research consists of three
              complementary elements:  1) a  survey of male and female committee chairs, 2)
              focused peer group  interviews with women committee chairs, and, 3) participant
               observation in three state legislatures.  The support provided by  the
              National Science Foundation will allow the student to  undertake the second and
              third components.  This will greatly  enhance the ability to generalize
              findings from the survey and to  explore cross-jurisdictional implications.
