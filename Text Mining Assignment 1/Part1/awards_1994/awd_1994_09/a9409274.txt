Abstract    :
              9409274  Novick         This proposal deals with connections between 
              combinatorial optimization, graph theory, matroid theory and  coding theory.
              Matroids generalize the notion of vector space. An  ideal clutter is a type of
              0-1 matrix which arises in the set  covering problem. Applications of the set
              covering problem  include airline crew scheduling, dispatching of trucks and 
              facility location. The theory of codes is used to efficiently  account for
              noise when sending, receiving and decoding messages.  Binary clutters occur in
              many graph theoretic settings and  in network applications. There are close
              connections between  binary  clutters, matroids and codes. The applicant
              proposes to  study the structure of  ideal, binary clutters in a matroidal 
              context and to determine the feasibility of a matroidal approach  to a long
              standing graph colouring problem and to some  questions involving the covering
              radius of certain codes.       The covering radius of a code is important for
              decoding.  Planning activities will include working with two senior 
              researchers, Andras Sebo, of CNRC in Grenoble, and J.D. Key of  Clemson
              University. The outcome of the planning period will  be several papers and a
              formal NSF proposal to be completed  within 18 months of the start date.  ***
