Abstract    :
              9409123  Shore  Ohio State Univ.  Dr. Sheldon Shore, Chemistry Department, Ohio
              State University, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and
              Organometallic Chemistry Program for research designed to expand and develop
              avenues for the preparation and study of organometallic transition metal
              cluster systems. Compounds derived from  ruthenium and osmium carbonyl clusters
              in which a boron is either incorporated at a cluster vertex or encapsulated
              within the metal core will be synthesized by reactions of borane with carbonyl
              or carbonylate metal clusters. The carbonylate anions will be further reduced
              with borane in hopes of obtaining species with multiple methylene bridges and
              reactions with carbon monoxide and hydrogen will be explored. The reduction of
              the ruthenium and osmium carbonyls with lanthanide metals will be used to
              prepare ladder polymers in which lanthanide/transition metal chains are joined
              by carbonyl linkages. With the development of the synthetic strategy, this work
              will be extended to a variety of transition metals and to alternative bridging
              groups such as cyanide. These ladder polymers will be loaded on hydroxylated
              magnesia and converted into bimetallic nanoparticles for use as catalysts and
              for studies of surface reactions.  Small metal containing particles are finding
              application in various areas of catalysis and as electronic devices. This
              project is aimed at preparing small "clusters" which are composed of a
              transition metal, such as ruthenium or osmium, and a boron atom or a more
              extended, sheet-like array of transition and  lanthanide metals. These will be
              converted into "nanoparticles" which will be characterized and evaluated for
              their chemical and catalytic properties.
