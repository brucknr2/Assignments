Abstract    :
              9409511  Smith  The Brookings Institution and the American Enterprises 
              Institute will jointly conduct a one day conference entitled  "Returns to
              Investment in Research " which will re-visit and  examine the quantitative and
              qualitative social and economic  benefits to society from investment in
              research.  This  conference will serve to assess the state of knowledge in 
              this area as well as to achieve an in-depth interactive  discussion  between
              academic experts and policy leaders of  the contributions of science to
              society.    Six papers will be commissioned and published as a result of  the
              conference.  These papers will address key elements of  the conference
              discussion--the impact of research and  development on economic
              growth/productivity, with emphasis  on the role of academic research and the
              results of the  quantitative analysis undertaken over the past 20 years.
