Abstract    :
              9409121  Pizziconi  The research proposed in this application is concerned with
              the  feasibility of an immunobiosensor design based upon sensitized  mast cells
              immobilized over the sensing junction of a thin-film  thermopile.  Antibody on
              the sensitized mast cells will activate  the cell in the presence of antigen,
              causing a exothermic  reaction that will result in very small temperature
              increases.  These temperature increases are detected by the thermopile as the 
              output measure.  The project involves microcalometric  characterization of cell
              activation, studies of methods of mast  cell immobilization and development of
              prototype sensors.  This  research further amplifies a technique using living
              biological  cells as the component in a sensor system by understanding mast 
              cell activation processes.  It will also extend bioanalytical  sensor research
              into devices based upon reticuloendothelial  cells.  ***
