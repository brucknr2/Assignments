              Rice University  Title: Collection of Multi-Century Coral Records of Ocean- 
              Atmosphere Variability from Clipperton Atoll    This SGER award supports the
              retrieval of coral records from the  remote island of Clipperton (10o 18'N,
              109o 13'W) in the eastern  Pacific.  The goal is to collect drill cores from
              massive corals  for climatic reconstruction.  Clipperton Island is uniquely 
              situated on the northern edge of the Intertropical Convergence Zone  (ITCZ), in
              an area that has >5m of rainfall per year and is also  directly influenced by
              El Nino events.  Clipperton is the eastern  most atoll in the Pacific and is
              perhaps the largest biogenic  carbonate build-up in the eastern Pacific.  Coral
              cores have never  been collected from Clipperton Island.  The collection of
              coral  cores from Clipperton Atoll will enable comparison of the timing of 
              interannual climatic variability with records from Panama and the  Galapagos. 
              The research will be an important step in the  reconstruction of the ITCZ and
              ENSO in the eastern Pacific.
