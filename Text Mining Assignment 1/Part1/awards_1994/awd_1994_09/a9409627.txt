Abstract    :
                The PI proposes to investigate the way in which people assign confidence to
              their beliefs and estimates.  One hypothesis is that noise, i.e., error
              variance within the confidence judgment, may result in systematic
              overconfidence.  This problem would be most pronounced as a person attempted to
              answer difficult questions, a finding which has previously been found in the
              literature.  A new study is proposed to test this hypothesis.  The PI also will
              investigate the role of practice in order to determine if greater experience
              within a topic domain enhances one's ability to assign more appropriate
              confidence levels to answers within that domain.  Finally, the investigator
              will attempt to determine if accuracy and confidence are influenced by the same
              types of feedback.
