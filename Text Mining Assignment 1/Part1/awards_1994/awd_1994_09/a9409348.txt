Abstract    :
              9409348  Leake       Case-based reasoning (CBR) systems reason from experience: 
               They solve new problems by retrieving relevant prior cases and  performing
              case adaptation knowledge is normally provided by the  system developer,
              hand-coded for a single task.  The difficulty of  encoding effective adaptation
              rules is widely recognized as a  serious impediment to the development of
              case-based reasoning  systems.  This research addresses that problem by
              developing a  model of automatic learning to improve case adaptation.  The
              model  learns memory search procedures to operationalize general  adaptation
              rules.  The model starts results in learning memory  search cases tracing the
              memory search processes used and their  results.  Those memory search cases
              reflect the applicability of  particular memory search strategies to particular
              adaption, learned  memory search cases are retrieved to provide specific
              guidance for  memory search.  The effects of the learning process on adaptation
               performance are evaluated by a series of experiments including  "ablation"
              studies and direct assessment of the quality of the  adaptations by human
              subjects.
