Abstract    :
                    9409840  Dunn  This Research Initiation Proposal supports a tightly
              coupled  experimental/theoretical program in the linear and nonlinear 
              constitutive response of piezoelectric ceramics.  Emphasis is  placed on the
              role played by microstructural-level phenomena which  occur at the grain and
              sub-grain levels and which result in a  constantly evolving microstructure
              which then influences the  overall constitutive response.  A constitutive model
              that is  thermodynamically sound and which incorporates the micromechanics  as
              internal variables will be developed.  ***
