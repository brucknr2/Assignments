Abstract    :
              9409877  Silver-Thorn  This Research Initiation Award involves the development
              of a  rate controlled soft tissue indentor, and in vivo evaluation  of the
              viscoelastic behavior of the bulk soft tissues of the  residual limbs of five
              below-knee amputees. The development  of a tissue indentor to measure the bulk
              soft tissue loading  response will provide a quantitative, objective means of 
              estimating the bulk soft tissue properties not currently  available with either
              the hand-fabrication or CAD-CAM  techniques.  Nonlinear finite element analysis
              will be used  to simulate the experimental data, together with the bulk  soft
              tissue geometry/composition information obtained via  magnetic resonance
              imaging that will be carried out in this  project, will significantly advance
              the understanding of the  bulk soft tissue loading response.  ***
