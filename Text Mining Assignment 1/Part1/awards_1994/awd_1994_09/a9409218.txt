Abstract    :
                      The Supercomputer Computations Research Institute (SCRI) at the Florida 
              State University is organizing a conference entitled "The Third International 
              Conference on Bioinformatics and Genome Research", to be held at the  Augustus
              B. Turnbull III Florida State Conference Center, Tallahassee Florida,  from
              June 1-4, 1994.  This conference is the third biennial conference since it  was
              started by SCRI in 1990.  The aim of the Third Conference is to provide a 
              forum in which experts from both the academic and industrial sectors, 
              including young researchers and students, can gather to interact.  It is hoped 
              that this will afford them an opportunity to gain first-hand knowledge of the 
              scope, direction, and future prospects of informatics, computing and analysis 
              techniques in genome related areas.    Speakers and participants will be
              computational experts, experimentalists and  technologists from around the
              world.  The interdisciplinary nature of the  conference is designed to:        
              o foster an exchange of ideas and information among disciplines; and       o
              lead to a transfer of technologies, especially from the academic sector        
                 to the private sector.           The focus of the conference will be on the
              computational and            experimental aspects of genome and genome-related
              analyses.             The subject areas cover:         o Nucleic acid and
              protein sequence research (Chairperson: Andrzej            Konopka)       o
              Computational/theoretical integrative approaches to gene regulation           
              and metabolism (Chairperson: Collado Vidas)       o Genome rearrangement
              (Chairperson: Pavel Pevzner)       o Database integration/interoperability
              (Chairperson: Hwa Lim)       o Molecular informatics of HIV (Chairperson: Hans
              Sieburg)       o Linguistics approaches (Chairperson: Sarah Barron)       o
              Methods for understanding genetic data through graphic displays           
              (Chairperson: Janan Eppig)       o Visualization of biological processes
              (Chairperson: Heinrich Giese n).              Leading experts in the field have
              committed to participate, and four            publishing companies have
              expressed interest in publishing the            conference proceedings.        
              This is a proposal to seek funding to help support conference speakers,        
                 post-doctoral fellows and students.
