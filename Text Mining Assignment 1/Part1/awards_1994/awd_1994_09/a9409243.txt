Abstract    :
              9409243  Ebert  Visualization of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations 
              is an important tool for CFD researchers.  However, current  visualization
              systems are lacking in several ways.  First, many  systems fail to display all
              of the three-dimensional information  contained in the data, only displaying
              stream-lines, contour  plots, or isosurfaces.  Second, most systems are a post-
               processing step only and cannot be incorporated into the  development cycle
              for the computational model.  Third, most  systems do not allow multiple flow
              variables to be displayed  simultaneously in an easily understandable format.  
               This project will develop an interactive surface and volumetric  visualization
              system for the three-dimensional visualization of  CFD simulations.  This
              system will use realistic volume rendering  techniques for gases and fluids to
              display the complete three-  dimensional data from the CFD simulation,
              including the  simultaneous display of multiple flow variables.  Three- 
              dimensional perception aids, such as accurate shadows,  atmospheric
              attenuation, and refraction, will be used to increase  the understandability of
              the data.  Furthermore, the system will  allow researchers to visualize and to
              change their models  interactively, aiding in the debugging of the
              computational  models and decreasing the development time of the CFD
              simulation.  This new system can be used as an interactive virtual wind 
              tunnel.  ***
