Abstract    :
              9409266  Jacobson  The objective of this research is to introduce a new set of
              tools  for building and analyzing simulation models of complex systems.  
              Issues considered include model verification and validation,  stopping
              conditions, variance reduction techniques, sensitivity  analysis, and
              experimental design. The theory of computational  complexity is used to provide
              a unified framework to classify and  study the issues.  A new heuristic
              algorithm will also be developed  to address these issues.  Six decision
              problems fundamental to  simulation modeling and analysis are identified and
              may be proven  to be non-deterministic polynomial complete.  Special cases of
              the  decision problems that are solvable in polynomial time are studied.   New
              heuristics for these problems are developed based on tree  search, dynamic
              programming, and simulated annealing.       The heuristics developed in this
              research have the potential   to provide quantitative, automated approaches to
              address  fundamental decision elements in discrete event simulation.  The  
              developed tools when attached to simulation languages can help   practitioners
              build more precise, better quality models, and   perform analysis with a higher
              degree of assurance and confidence.   The outcome of this research has the
              potential to advance the  domain of systems that can be modeled and analyzed
              using discrete   event simulation.
