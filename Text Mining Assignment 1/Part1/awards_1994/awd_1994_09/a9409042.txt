Abstract    :
              The proposed work is aimed at using renormalization group  techniques to
              construct light-front Hamiltonians from QCD.  The results of this approach
              include identifying forms for  confining and chiral symmetry breaking
              interactions, so that  a low-energy picture of quarks and gluons with few
              degrees  of freedom can be constructed with a direct connection to  QCD.  ***
