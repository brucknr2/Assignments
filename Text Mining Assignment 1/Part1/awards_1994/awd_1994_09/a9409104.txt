Abstract    :
              9409104  Regan  This research will analyze computational problems which are 
              solvable in linear time, or which belong to very small uniform  circuit
              classes.  Linear time has not received nearly as much  attention as the concept
              of polynomial time, and has been  considered to lack a good machine model. 
              Previous work has  developed the "Block Move" (BM) model, which is a
              significant  extension of the "Block Transfer" (BT) model of Aggarwal, 
              Chandra, and Snir, and showed the BM to have good properties of  robustness and
              universal simulation for linear time, and to  characterize some of the
              low-level circuit classes.  The present  work will use new tools given by the
              BM for nonlinear lower  bounds on time and for deeper analysis of low-level
              complexity  classes.  The BM treats "random" access to data as having  tangible
              cost, as observed with real machines, and quantifies  memory latency and
              tangible cost, as observed with real machines,  and quantifies memory latency
              and communication delays between  processors and data.  The question of how
              much random access is  needed to solve a problem is related to older classic
              problems of  determinism versus nondeterminism.  A new approach to lower 
              bounds is to be pursued further, this work will analyze  computational problems
              in terms of information structures apart  from particular machine models.  ***
