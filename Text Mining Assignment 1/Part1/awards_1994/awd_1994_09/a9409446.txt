Abstract    :
              9409446  Ruhlandt-Senge  Syracuse University  Dr. Karin Ruhlandt-Senge,
              Chemistry Department, Syracuse University, is supported by the Inorganic,
              Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division
              with a Research Planning Grant to explore the preparation of compounds in which
              an alkaline earth is bonded to another metal. Compounds containing a
              homometallic bond between two group 2 metals will be  prepared by reduction of
              an alkaline earth halide, R-M-X (R = bulky alkyl, aryl, sily, amido, thiolato;
              M = Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, or Ba; X = Cl, Br, or I). In addition, complexes containing
              a transition metal to alkaline earth bond will be produced from the reactions
              of metal carbonyls or carbonylates with R-M-X or with the products obtained
              from the reduction of R-M-X. A series of chemical reactions will be attempted
              in order to probe the characteristics of metal-metal bonds involving a group 2
              atom.     There are many compounds which contain two or more metals bonded to
              one another. These species have a variety of applications including as
              catalysts and electronic materials. However, there are no well characterized
              molecules in which an alkaline earth metal, i.e. beryllium, magnesium, calcium,
              strontium, or barium, is bonded to another metal. In this project methods will
              be devised for the preparation of such species and the chemical properties of
              the metal-metal bonds will be explored. Ultimate uses as precursors to advanced
              materials are foreseen.
