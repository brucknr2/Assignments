Abstract    :
                9409793  Boesgaard    Observations will be made to determine the abundances of
              the light  elements lithium, beryllium and oxygen in stars and in the 
              interstellar gas.  The abundances of lithium and beryllium in the  oldest stars
              gives information on inhomogenieties in the early  universe while the beryllium
              and oxygen abundances in stars of  various ages hold clues to the way in which
              elements formed as the  galaxy aged.  Both lithium and beryllium will be used
              to test  mechanisms which operate within stars.  This research will take 
              advantage of new technical developments in astronomical detectors  and new
              theoretical advances in stellar atmospheres, stellar  interiors and Big Bang
              nucleosynthesis.  ***
