Abstract    :
              9409064  Kalanovic  In this research project, variable structure nonlinear rate 
              controllers are developed for dynamic systems commonly  encountered in the
              context of industrial environment. These  controllers significantly improve
              system performance by  increasing the speed of response, lowering overshoot,
              and  enabling high disturbance rejection. The configuration of  the controller
              includes an error feedback structure  identifier coupled with a variable
              structure artificial  neural network. The modified controller, so designed, 
              provides a capability of enforcing robust and high quality  tracking.
              Experimental results validate mathematical  analysis, modeling and simulation
              of the controlled  nonlinear systems.  ***
