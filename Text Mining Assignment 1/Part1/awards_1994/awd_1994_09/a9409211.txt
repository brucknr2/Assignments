Abstract    :
              9409211  Molian       This is an Engineering Research Deployment Teaching
              Initiation  award.  Under this award, course materials will be developed to 
              introduce the laser processing of materials into mechanical  engineering
              undergraduate and graduate courses through laboratory  and recitation.  This
              will include the teaching of recent research  results, the preparation of
              laboratory exercises, providing hands-  on training in carrying out
              experiments, and videotaping the  research.       This project should prepare
              undergraduate and graduate  students for the scientific and technical
              environment of the future  by incorporating the recent innovations of laser
              processing  technology.
