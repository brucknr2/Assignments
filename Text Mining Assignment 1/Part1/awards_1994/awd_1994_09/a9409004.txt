Abstract    :
              Mousseau  9409004   The interactions between insects and the plants upon which
              they feed and lay eggs are of great interest to both population biologists and
              agriculture scientists.  This study will investigate egg laying behavior,
              larval growth, and survival of the leaf-mining beetle, Brachys tessellatus
              (Coleoptera:Buprestidae), known to attack five species of oak trees (Quercus
              laevis, Q. marilandica, Q. nigra, Q. incana, and Q. margaretta) in the
              southeastern United States.  The relative importance of the genetic and
              environmental influences on this beetle's preferences for a given tree species
              will be determined.  Similarly, the genetic and environmental basis to
              variation in larval growth and survival on the different trees will be
              examined.  It is postulated that where a female deposits an egg (w.r.t. tree
              species) may be the most important determinant of larval success.  This study
              will also test for a correlation between a female's preference and the success
              of her offspring.  The results of this study will provide insights concerning
              the factors promoting the specialization of an insect on a given plant, which
              will have bearing on questions relating to insect diet breadth, and host-race
              formation.
