Abstract    :
                 This project involves the study of both on-line and dynamic 
              algorithms---types of algorithms with the unifying theme of  uncertainty about 
              future requests to the algorithm.  New methods  of average-case analysis are 
              introduce to the study of on-line algorithms, drawing from experience in 
              information theory  and data compression (and, in particular, from stochastic 
              complexity).  In addition, the computational complexity of making  optimal 
              on-line decisions when the input requests are drawn from  a known distribution,
               is investigated.    In the area of dynamic algorithms and data structures, 
              techniques  are developed for designing dynamic algorithms by examining  the 
              structure of existing (or perhaps  new) parallel  algorithms.  Initial results
              show how to use easily  computable properties of  algebraic circuits in order
              to design  dynamic algorithms, and these results  are extended in this  project
              to a wider class of problems involving more  complex  incremental operations on
              the inputs.  In addition, dynamic  algorithms  for parallel machines are
              developed, which are  important for applications  which require very fast
              response to  dynamically changing data.
