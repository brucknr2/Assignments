Abstract    :
              9409619  McClure  With this Career Advancement Award, the Division of Chemistry 
              is supporting the research of Dr. Cynthia K. McClure of the  Department of
              Chemistry at Montana State University.  Professor  McClure will use the award
              to learn the background, theory and  application of high-level calculations on
              comlex molecules.  The knowledge gained will then be put to use to design
              improved  syntheses in the area of organophosphorus chemistry.  She will  also
              spend time learning the best methods of accomplishing  and/or increasing the
              bio-availability of these types of  compounds.
