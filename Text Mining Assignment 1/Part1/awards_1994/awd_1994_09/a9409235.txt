Abstract    :
                  The PI proposes to apply ideas from the area of robust/stochastic
              optimization to significant problems in the telecommunications industry.  In
              order to develop realistic models, the PI will work with Bellcore and US WEST. 
              These firms will assist in selecting the target applications, implementing the
              robust optimization models, and evaluating the concepts.
