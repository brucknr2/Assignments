Abstract    :
              9409078  Showen         The objective of this research is to better determine
              the  effects of lightning or other transient events on the ionosphere.   The
              method to be employed is to measure and analyze IS data taken  at Arecibo,
              Puerto Rico, during lightning storms.  Both the ion  line and plasma line
              echoes will be used to find the transient  responses of number density,
              temperature, velocity and enhanced  plasma-wave strengths.  The likely results
              of this study will be  increased knowledge of lightning E-field penetration
              into the  ionosphere, and resultant ionization and plasma wave generation.  
              This work should permit the joining of transient measurements of  satellites
              with those of the IS radars, so that the entire  structure from the lower
              ionosphere to the magnetosphere can be  analyzed in unison.
