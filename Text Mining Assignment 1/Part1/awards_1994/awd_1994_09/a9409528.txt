Abstract    :
              9409528  Chang  A study of the mixed lubrication regime which lies between the 
              micro-elastohydrodynamic and boundary lubrication regimes will be  conducted. 
              The modeling will be based on using the full surface  roughness for the
              asperity interaction determinations and a  roughness with the short wavelength
              components filtered out for  the calculations of the hydrodynamic pressure
              distribution.  Thermal effects and three-dimensional roughness effects will be 
              included in tests of the algorithm's robustness.  The model will  be validated
              in tests with tribological surfaces coated with  ceramic coatings or with solid
              lubricants.  ***
