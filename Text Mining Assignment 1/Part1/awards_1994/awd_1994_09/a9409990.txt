Abstract    :
              This research planning grant addresses the complex relationships between
              ethnicity and    risk perceptions.  Cross-cultural research on models of risk
              perception is vital to the   validity and generalizability of all research on
              risk perception and decision making.     Research activities will extend
              current knowledge about the theoretical validity and   reliability of the
              conceptualization of risk modeled in the Simplified Conjoint Expected   Risk
              (SCER) model of Holtgrave and Weber across different ethnic and cultural
              groups.    The research will modify and pilot test the survey instrument used
              by Holtgrave and   Weber in a group of white individuals with known
              characteristics.  The results of this   analysis will be used as evidence
              regarding the theoretical validity of this   conceptualization of risk
              perception for white individuals, and provide a source for   comparison with
              other ethnic and cultural groups.  The research will also identify  
              theoretically valid and reliable measures of group membership (for ethnicity,
              culture, and   level of acculturation) to be used in the subsequent
              cross-cultural research.  The initial   research site, Los Angeles/Orange
              County, is optimal for cross-cultural research because   there are many
              different ethnic and cultural groups, e.g., African-Americans, Latinos  
              (Chicanos, recent immigrants from Mexico), Asians (Vietnamese, Cambodians,  
              Japanese, Chinese), living in this region.
