Abstract    :
              9409752  Narasimhan  This investigation addresses the Sparse Geometric Spanner
              problem  and its many variants.  Given a graph G and t1, a t-spanner is an 
              edge subgraph G' of G such that the distances between every pair  of vertices
              in G' are within a factor of t of their distances in  G.  Geometric graphs have
              vertices corresponding to points in the  Euclidean space and their edge weights
              correspond to Euclidean  distances.  Many practical applications require sparse
              geometric  spanners.  Sparseness is measured in terms of size (number of 
              edges), and/or weight (sum of weights of edges).    Various aspects of the
              problem will be studied:  How to construct  sparse spanners (algorithms)?  How
              to analyze quality of the  output (geometric analysis)?  What is the complexity
              of the  problem (complexity and approximability)?  How to design  efficient
              algorithms (practical implementations)?  The study of  variants of the problem
              including connectivity-constrained  spanners and single-source spanners will
              also be undertaken.  This has applications in analyzing the performance of many
               practical geometric algorithms and studying optimal geometric  structures like
              minimum steiner trees, optimal spanners, and  optimal triangulations.  ***
