Abstract    :
              9409681  THOMPSON  This research is a series of experiments examining the
              ability of  people to evaluate the accuracy of hearsay evidence about out-of- 
              court statements by children.  The project will first examine  factors that
              affect the accuracy of testimony by an adult witness  regarding a child's
              statements, focusing particularly on the  effects of witness preconceptions and
              on the ability of the witness  to take into account the effects of suggestive
              techniques used in  interviewing children.  Sesondly, the study will test the
              ability  of people to evaluate the testimony of the adult hearsay witnesses, 
              focusing on whether they take into account factors known to  influence the
              reliability of hearsay witnesses.      These studies cast light on important
              theoretical issues concerning  the accuracy of cascaded inference in
              jurisprudence.  They will  also have considerable practical value by
              illuminating the  cognitive factors that underly the ability of people to
              evaluate  the accuracy of hearsay evidence.  ***
