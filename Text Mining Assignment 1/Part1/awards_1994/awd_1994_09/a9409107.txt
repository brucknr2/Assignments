Abstract    :
              9409107     Palmer    Although Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR)
              is a  versatile technique for studying the structure and properties of 
              polymers, dynamic vibrational spectroscopy by the use of FT-IR has  had limited
              application in the polymer field because of a number of  experimental
              difficulties.  This Small Grant for Exploratory  Research will explore the
              possible application of step-scan dynamic  FT-IR and 2D FT-IR to investigate
              the dynamics of molecular  reorientation and relaxation in selected liquid
              crystalline  polymers, both of the lyotropic and thermotropic types.  If 
              successful, this method would permit the study of polymeric liquid  crystals
              with a new level of detail.  ***
