Abstract    :
              9409026  Krassowska  The research proposed in this application develops a model 
              in which a cell is treated as a unit and its macroscopic  dynamics are governed
              by a set of equations applicable to  the whole cell.  Previous results in this
              area have been  slowed because the response to a fully excitable cell to an 
              external field is governed by a boundary valued problem with  nonlinear and
              dynamic conditions on the membrane.  This  research will overcome the previous
              difficulty by developing  a model of the whole cell.  Objectives of the
              proposed work  include developing a quantitative description of the 
              macroscopic dynamics of a single cell in an external field,  study the
              influence of membrane folding and internal  structures of the cell on its
              macroscopic dynamics, and  establish the relationship between optical
              measurements of  the transmembrane potential and the macroscopic dynamics of  a
              single cell.  ***
