Abstract    :
              9409854  Hines       The research entails the study of dissipative systems 
              admitting global attractors along with some questions concerning  population
              dynamics. Central to these topics will be the analysis  of certain kinds of
              differential delay equations of both ordinary  and partial type as optimal
              models.  ***
