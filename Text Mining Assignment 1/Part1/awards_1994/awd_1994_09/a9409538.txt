Abstract    :
                  9409538  Hemker  This Research Initiation Proposal is to study the creep
              behavior of  some of the new high temperature structural materials which are 
              expected to be used in the aerospace and automotive industries.   Monotonic and
              transient mechanical creep testing will be combined  with quantitative
              transmission electron microscopy in order to  elucidate the fundamental
              mechanisms that control creep in TiA1-  base alloys and composites.  The
              ultimate purpose of this project  is to gain insight into the mechanisms that
              can be used to improve  the creep resistance of these alloys and composites.
