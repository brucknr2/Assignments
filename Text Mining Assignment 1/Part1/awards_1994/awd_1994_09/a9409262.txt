Abstract    :
              With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program Professor Waymouth of   Stanford
              University will develop novel catalytic and enantioselective   methods for the
              construction of polycyclic rings using transition metal   compounds. The
              enantioselective synthesis of a variety of substituted   carbocycles and
              heterocycles will be pursued. Methodology developed in   the catalytic 
              enantioselctive synthesis of polymers will be applied to   the synthesis of
              small rings.    Methods developed for the synthesis of novel polymers using
              transition   metals will be applied to the efficient synthesis of carbon
              containing   ring compounds. The techniques employed are applicable to the
              efficient   manufacture of novel plastics, pharmaceuticals,  and materials that
              will   be necessary for future needs of society.
