Abstract    :
                This project examines problems in circuit complexity,  using classical
              analytic methods.  The project is centered  around three basic  questions, the
              first and last of which  are specifically geared towards basic, 
              long-unresolved  issues that have hindered progress in the area.  (1) Do simple
               operations (such as shifts, or products) on hard functions preserve hardness? 
              (3) In what ways can hardness be used for learning functions in a complexity 
              class? (2) What are the analytic properties that are common to  constant depth 
              circuits with various sets of symmetric gates?   Already partial answers have 
              yielded the following:  (a) a non-trivial, complexity bounds   involving
              constant depth circuits and more significantly,   the analytic patterns
              underlying such  bounds; (b) general methods for using hard functions to obtain
                large classes of pseudorandom generators and training sets   for learning;
              and (c) conversion of  lower bounds on circuit complexity into upper bounds on
              the complexity of  learning, and vice versa.  The analytic techniques used, are
              partly  multivariate generalizations of univariate approximation methods,
              partly from  coding theory  and partly from spectral analysis.  The techniques 
               developed are of independent interest to approximation theorists, and   solve,
              in particular, a number of problems involving general Boolean  functions, and
              combinatorics over the multidimensional unit-cube.
