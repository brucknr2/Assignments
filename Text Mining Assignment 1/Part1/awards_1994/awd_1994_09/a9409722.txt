Abstract    :
              University of Texas at Austin  Gustavo A. de Veciana  RIA: Resource Management
              for Networks: Service Provisioning, Flow  Control, and Robustness    This focus
              of this work is the development of resource management  schemes for
              communication networks.  Model based approaches using  effective and decoupling
              bandwidth constraints that guarantee both  individual and aggregate quality of
              service requirements are  investigated. The emphasis is on practical issues, as
              well as on  understanding the accuracy of these approximations at the network 
              level.  Further study of these concepts should elucidate the impact  of flow
              control on network capacity.  Since, in practice, traffic  statistics and
              demand may be unknown or time varying, methods for  on-line estimation and
              control are also investigated.  For example,  a self-tuning rate control
              throttle is proposed which could in  principle minimize a traffic stream's
              burstiness subject to a loss  or delay constraint by monitoring the arrival
              process.  This is a  first step towards intelligent networks that monitor,
              learn, and  adapt to the traffic statistics and demands.  The final goal of 
              this research is to develop comparison methods based on the  "robustness" of a
              performance guarantee for a given traffic stream.
