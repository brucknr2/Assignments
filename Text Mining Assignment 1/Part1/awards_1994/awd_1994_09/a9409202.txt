Abstract    :
              9409202  Wang    Several  different types of rhythmic oscillations can be
              recorded  from  the  surface  of  the  brain  during  different  behaviors, 
              particularly  during different stages of sleep.  Oscillations  of  about  7-14 
              Hz  occur during early stages of  sleep  and  slower  oscillations of 0.5-5 Hz
              occur during later stages of  sleep.  It  is  known  that the 7-14 Hz
              oscillations arises from the thalamus  and  there is some evidence that the
              slower oscillation may  also  be  a thalamic oscillation. However, it is not
              known exactly  how  the  neurons of the thalamus produce these oscillations. In
               this  study  from  a  young physicist, mathematical  and  computational 
              modelling studies of these rhythmic oscillations will be  carried  out. The
              role of connections between the thalamus and cortex  and  the  role of
              properties of individual thalamic nerve cells in the  production   of  these 
              oscillations  will  be  examined.   These  theoretical studies should provide
              insights into the original  of  these  oscillations  as well as those that 
              occur  in  the  brain  during  sensory  perception  and  those  associated 
              with   other  behaviors.
