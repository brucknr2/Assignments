Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is analyze the behavior of asset  prices, the nature
              of economic fluctuations, and the links  between asset markets and the
              macroeconomy.  The project consists  of three major components.  The first
              relates the pattern of  unconditional mean asset returns to the covariances of
              asset  returns with news about current and future stock returns and  labor
              income.  The second part of the project focuses on the  behavior of conditional
              mean asset returns.  It is well known  that stock prices tend to fall when the
              economy enters a  recession.  This part of the project will investigate habit 
              formation and risk aversion behavior on part of investors over  the business
              cycle.  The third component of the project explores  new directions in
              macroeconomics including the role of home  production technology in real
              business cycle models, the nature  of exogenous shocks to monetary policy, and
              the use of growth  theory to in estimating trend components of output.  This 
              research is important because it will provide a deeper  understanding of the
              interaction between the stock market and the  business cycle.
