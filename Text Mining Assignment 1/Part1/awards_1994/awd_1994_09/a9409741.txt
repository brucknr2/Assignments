Abstract    :
              9409741  Gehrke       This career advancement award supports mathematical
              research  analyzing the structure of self-dual Stone algebras.  The  importance
              of self-duality in lattices, and particularly in Stone  algebras, was motivated
              by applications to conditional event  structures in probability and rough set
              algebras.  Once a better  understanding of the self-duality is accomplished,
              the original  applications will be reexamined and new ones sought.  The point 
              of view is a categorical one, developed through extensive work  using
              homological methods in algebra.  The work draws on diverse  fields of logic and
              model theory, general topology, nonstandard  analysis and partially ordered
              sets - as well as lattice theory,  which still remains one of the main tools in
              the study of logics  for computer science, artificial intelligence and expert
              systems.  ***
