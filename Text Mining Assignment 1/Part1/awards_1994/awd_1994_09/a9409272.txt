Abstract    :
              9409272  Fisher    The long-range goal of this research program is to gain 
              understanding of the chemistry of low-temperature plasmas.  For  further
              progress in plasma technology to occur, it is imperative  to supplement
              empirical knowledge with solid understanding of the  basic chemical processes
              involved. We will determine the  reactivity of plasma radicals at the surface
              of depositing films  using the IRIS (Imaging of Radicals Interacting with
              Surfaces)  technique that combines spatially-resolved laser-induced 
              fluorescence with plasma molecular beams.  We will examine plasma  deposited
              thin films as well as plasma environments that produce  films with desired
              qualities. Several analytical methods will be  used to characterize plasma
              environments and deposited films.  These include optical emission spectroscopy
              (OES), laser-induced  fluorescence, and light-scattering in the plasmas.  %%% 
              Plasmas have many industrial applications, including thin film  deposition and
              etching, surface modification, and polymer  synthesis. Plasma deposition is
              particularly versatile for  production of thin films and also provides
              environmentally-clean  routes to materials.  A primary aim of this work is to
              establish  plasma environments conducive to production of particular film 
              qualities or plasma species.  This research will contribute to  improving the
              general performance of advanced devices and  integrated circuits used in
              computing, information processing,  and telecommunications.  ***
