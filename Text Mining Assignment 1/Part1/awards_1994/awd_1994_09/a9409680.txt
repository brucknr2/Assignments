Abstract    :
              9409680  Johnson       This is an Engineering Research Deployment Teaching
              Initiative  award.  Under this award, a service course will be developed to 
              teach asymptotic methods for approximate process models.  The  course and text
              will be aimed at advanced students who are  specializing in the area of
              deformation processing.  Over the last  several years, several new approximate
              models for sheet rolling,  extrusion, coating flows, etc. have been developed
              using asymptotic  methods.  The goal of this activity is to introduce these
              methods  into engineering curricula, educate engineers in their use, and 
              provide a monograph that will cover the recent developments.       This project
              should enable advanced modelling methods to be  introduced into engineering
              curricula, improving the education of  engineers in an important area of
              manufacturing.
