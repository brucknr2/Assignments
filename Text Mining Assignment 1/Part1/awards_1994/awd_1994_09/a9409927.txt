Abstract    :
              9409927  Braddock-Wilking  U. of Missouri - St. Louis  Dr. Janet
              Braddock-Wilking, Chemistry Department, University of Missouri - St. Louis, is
              supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
              of the Chemistry Division with a Research Planning Grant to develop synthetic
              routes to polyhedral cage compounds of silicon containing peripheral transition
              metal substituents.  First, a series of (trichlorosilyl)metal complexes will be
              generated by the oxidative addition of trichlorosilane to electron-rich
              transition metal complexes. These metal-silyl compounds will then be
              reductively coupled using various reducing agents to afford the metal
              substituted polyhedral silicon clusters. New silicon nuclear magnetic resonance
              techniques will be developed to facilitate the characterization of these
              compounds.    Silicon is one of the most useful materials available in modern
              technology, for example, silicon wafers are central to a large portion of the
              electronics industry. However, very little attention has been devoted to the
              design of precursors which would permit very small silicon crystals with well
              defined sizes or silicon with specific surface properties to be easily
              obtained. In this research a new  class of compounds will be prepared in which
              a small number of silicon atoms are joined to one another to make "cages" of
              specific sizes and geometries. Surrounding the silicon cages will  be a sheath
              of another metal. Ultimately, these compounds are envisioned as precursors for
              small "nanoclusters" of silicon and for thin films of metal-silicides.
