Abstract    :
              An experimental study of partially premixed flames is proposed.  The flame
              structure and pollutant emissions will be determined as a function of the
              degree of mixing, turbulence conditions, and fuel mixture properties.  A clever
              burner design is proposed to give variable mixedness conditions.  The degree of
              mixing will be measured using fluorescence tomographic imaging from fuel flows
              seeded with either acetone or NO. Fuels to be studied include H2, CH4, and
              C3H8.
