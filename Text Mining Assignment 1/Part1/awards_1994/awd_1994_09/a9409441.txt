Abstract    :
              This Career Advancement Award for Women Scientists and Engineers helps to
              augment the research potential of the principal investigator through the
              development of skills in the preparation of inorganic membranes.  Alumina
              membranes with various nominal pore sizes and size distributions, with
              well-defined non-idealities like pore branching, and with different surface
              charge character will be made by anodic oxidation and used to expand
              fundamental studies on hindered diffusion.
