Abstract    :
                  9409190  Smith           ABSTRACT      (PRIDE) Partnership for Retraining
              and Innovations in Delivering Education    Drexel University, in partnership
              with Camden County College, Delaware County Community College, and the
              Community College of Philadelphia will create a "Ship Yard" community college
              to retrain displaced defense industry personnel at the Philadelphia Naval Ship
              Yard (PNSY) and the Philadelphia Naval Station.  A full spectrum of educational
              opportunities, from GED and certificate courses through continuing professional
              education and B.S. and M.S. degree programs, will be offered to an estimated
              target population of over 5,000 workers.  Workers will be trained for careers
              in manufacturing in one of a number of areas identified as important to the
              Greater Philadelphia Area: e.g., biotechnology, environmental controls and
              remediation, and telecommunication.  Industry involvement will include
              participation on an advisory board, curriculum development, and adjunct
              teaching.  Resources at the PNSY, including manufacturing equipment and
              facilities and the Career Transition Center, will be available to this program.
