Abstract    :
               In this project, compiler algorithms for the enhancement of data  locality on
              parallel computer systems are developed. These  algorithms are  implemented in
              a compiler for a data parallel  extension to C targeted to  MIMD systems.
              Enhancements to data  locality improve the run time  performance of programs by
               reducing the need for communication and/or  synchronization. This  work
              extends compiler design and implementation work on  data  parallel extensions
              to FORTRAN (e.g., FORTRAN 90 with extensions)  targeted to SIMD systems.   
              Both language extensions and compiler optimizations  are investigated.  The
              language extensions are aimed at improving the  expressiveness of data
              parallelism. Generalizations of data  locality  representations and algorithms
              to a wider class of  architectures and languages  are designed and implemented.
               Automatic techniques for localizing data are  investigated  with programmer
              directives.
