Abstract    :
              9409288  Mendis-Handagama                              ABSTRACT                 
                                                                                             
              Leydig cells in the testis are the primary source of the  "male hormone" or
              testosterone in mammals.  Testosterone  production by Leydig cells is activated
              by another hormone  named luteinizing hormone (LH).  Cholesterol is an
              essential  ingredient in testosterone production and following  activation by
              LH hormone, cholesterol is moved into a  special site within the cell named
              mitochodria to begin this  process.  To date, the way that cholesterol is moved
              into  mitochondria during testosterone production is poorly  understood. 
              However, it is certain that cholesterol needs a  special mode of transport
              within the cell to reach its  destination, because it is insoluble in water. 
              Studies are  planned in this grant proposal to understand this process.
