Abstract    :
              9409005  McFadden    This project designs, sets up, and supports an on-line
              software  library for theoretical economic, econometric, and statistical 
              computation.  This service will complement existing electronic  working paper
              series, which at this time do not support  computational algorithms, and have
              not solved the problem of  indexing, documenting, and providing test harnesses
              for these  algorithms.  The library will serve as an NSF repository for 
              research results related to computation, as well as a central  location for
              software exchange among researchers throughout the  world.  In the course of
              this project, the investigators will  work with developers of algorithms at
              Berkeley and elsewhere to  produce standards for documentation and testing that
              will  facilitate exchange of scientific software.  Computational  software
              developed through the Berkeley Econometrics Laboratory,  including software
              developed by the principal investigators, will  be used as a testing ground for
              development of standards that are  feasible and useful for both developers and
              users.  Authors of  software that have potential applicability in economics
              will be  encouraged to submit algorithms that conform to documentation and 
              testing standards.
