              Louisiana State University    Cyclic amphipathic octapeptides with alternating
              D- and L-amino acid residues will be synthesized. The opposing polarity faces
              in these peptides will be studied as models for interactions in phospholipid
              bi-layers. Cyclo (L-Xxx-D-Xxx)2-(L-Leu-D-Leu)2 , where X = Ser, Lys or Glu,
              will be prepared and characterized by NMR and high resolution mass
              spectroscopy. The potential of these cyclic peptides to induce leakage in a
              phospholipid bi-layer will be explored by measuring the change in fluorescence
              intensity of carboxyfluorescein due to leakage from liposomes.     This
              Research Planning Grant from the Chemistry Division supports the research of
              Professor Maria Ngu-Schwemlein at Louisiana State University. Cyclic peptides
              with alternating D- and L- amino acid residues will be prepared. These
              molecules that have alternating "right hand" and "left hand" amino acid
              residues bonded into a cyclic array will be characterized by spectroscopic
              methods. Interactions across the ring of opposing charged residues is expected
              to display unique physical properties in these cyclic peptides. The possibility
              of these peptides inducing leakage in biologically important phospholipid
              membranes will be explored.
