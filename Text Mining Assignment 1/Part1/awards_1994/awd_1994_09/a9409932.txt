Abstract    :
              9409932  Walton  Purdue Univ.  Dr. Richard A. Walton, Chemistry Department,
              Purdue University, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and
              Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division for an investigation
              of the redox reactivity of rhenium polyhydrides and compounds containing
              rhenium-rhenium triple bonds. The mechanism of reductive coupling reactions
              induced by the Re-Re triple bond and the reactivity of complexes containing the
              3-metallafuran ring will be examined. The reactions of rhenium-heptahydrides
              with various organic acids will be explored as routes to stereochemically rigid
              8-coordinate molecules. The unusual isomerization of internal to terminal
              alkynes which occurs in some of the hydride systems will be utilized to prepare
              rhenium-alkylidyne complexes.    A portion of this project is aimed at
              developing the ability of compounds which contain two directly bonded rhenium
              atoms to supply electrons to small molecules such as carbon monoxide. The
              addition of these electrons will cause the small molecules to bond to one
              another, or to other nearby molecules, thereby forming more exended structures.
              Such behavior is important in both industrial and laboratory processes. In the
              second part of the research, rhenium compounds surrounded by 8 other groups
              will be prepared. These very crowded molecules are expected to be capable of
              inducing a number of new reactions in molecules with which they interact.
