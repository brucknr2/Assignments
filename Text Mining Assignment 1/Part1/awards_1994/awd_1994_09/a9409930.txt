Abstract    :
                             During the development of the nervous system, neurons undergo a
              number of processes, including proliferation and differentiation.  The purpose
              of this research is to study the role of a growth factor receptor-like molecule
              (brain specific kinase, Bsk) in neuronal differentiation.  Growth factors and
              their receptors are known to induce neuronal differentiation and support the
              survival of neurons, and Bsk has been shown to be associated with neurons in
              the limbic system of the brain during development.  The studies will, first,
              investigate the timing of the production of Bsk by neurons in the limbic
              system, and then will attempt to modify the timing of its production by
              introducing into limbic system neurons an altered Bsk gene.  The results of
              these studies will further our understanding of the development of the limbic
              system as well as the role of growth factors in neural development.
