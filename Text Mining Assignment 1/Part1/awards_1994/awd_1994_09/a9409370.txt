Abstract    :
                  9409370  Chen      This a research planning award to investigate interactive
              machine  learning techniques which integrate modern human-computer  interaction
              technology with machine learning theory and  applications with the purpose of
              building more powerful and  flexible machine learning systems.  The purpose in
              the integration  of these two technologies, which up to now had been developed 
              mostly in isolation from each other, is to obtain machine learning, 
              inferencing, and interaction with teachers via multimodal  interfaces which may
              incorporate natural language and other  modalities in an integral system.  The
              planning process includes an  extensive literature search, study of possible
              interfaces for  integration with learnability models, identification of
              critical  issues in interactive learning research and learning algorithms,  and
              preliminary design of a prototype for assessing the  effectiveness of such
              learning systems.
