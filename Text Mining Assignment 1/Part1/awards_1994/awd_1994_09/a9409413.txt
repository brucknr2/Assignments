Abstract    :
              9409413  Messner  Friction modeling and friction compensation will be studied
              for  ball bearings operating in regimes of rapid lubrication and  friction
              changes which have not previously been investigated.  Specifically addressed
              will be the conditions where a disk drive  actuator bearing is undergoing high
              frequency/low amplitude  oscillations in track-follow mode immediately after
              rapid  deceleration from the high angular velocities associated with the 
              track-seek mode.  Adaptive, learning, and nonlinear controllers  which
              incorporate the derived friction models will be designed  and tested.  ***
