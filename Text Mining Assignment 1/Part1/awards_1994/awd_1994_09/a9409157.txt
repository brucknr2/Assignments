Abstract    :
                    9409157  Jenkins  This Research Initiation Award is to study the wrinkling
              of  membranes.  The research seeks to study the control of wrinkling  that
              exists in many areas such as aerospace vehicles and biological  organisms. 
              Attempts will be made to numerically predict and  experimentally verify
              wrinkling conditions for the same problem.   Once this is completed an attempt
              will then be made to develop an  algorithm to demonstrate active control of the
              deformations.  ***
