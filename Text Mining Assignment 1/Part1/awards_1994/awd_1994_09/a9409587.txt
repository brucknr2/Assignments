Abstract    :
              This research is investigating a new and innovative class of  adaptive and
              hierarchical methods in image and video compression.   It has two primary
              objectives: (1) to develop a powerful and  flexible infrastructure for
              addressing new and challenging image  communication applications, targeted at
              overcoming the drawbacks of  current state-of-the-art methods; and (2) based on
              this, to  formulate novel, optimal, fast algorithms using joint optimization 
              methods.    A novel compression framework based on wavelets and efficient, 
              flexible signal descriptions using adaptive wavelet packets and  adaptive
              quantization is being explored.  This research is also  studying motion
              compensation in a new hierarchical estimation-  theoretic framework, and is
              formalizing the fundamental subject of  optimal resource allocation in a
              dependent coding environment.   Joint optimization of the source-coder
              functional components is  being considered throughout, and is being extended to
              include the  channel for transmission applications.    The significance of this
              proposal lies in its laying the  theoretical framework for next-generation
              high-performance coders,  which, we conjecture, will need to be hierarchical
              and adaptive in  their description and will exploit interdependencies among
              their  functional components optimally.  Results of the proposed study  provide
              a new and useful knowledge-base for current and future  applications requiring
              scaleable and flexible architectures,  transcodability, and compatible
              subchannels, formats and displays.
