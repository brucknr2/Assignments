Abstract    :
              9409778  Knox    The general objective of this project is to quantitatively
              analyze  the field stratigraphic record of the record-breaking 1993 flood on 
              the middle reach of the upper Mississippi River upstream and  downstream of
              Keokuk, Iowa.  Analysis of flood records for the  Keokuk River gage indicates
              that the 1993 flood had an expected  recurrence frequency of only once in 500
              years for this reach of  the river.  Analysis of the stratigraphic record
              resulting from  this 1993 flood therefore provides an opportunity to establish 
              quantitative documentation of sedimentological and geochemical  properties of a
              rare flood event that is seldom witnessed in  historical records. 
              Project-specific objectives include (1)  engineering surveys to quantitatively
              determine relationships  between depths and volumes of sediment deposition in
              relation to  relative heights of depositional surfaces with respect to main 
              currents of flood flow;  (2) analysis of sedimentological  properties of flood
              depositional units, including grain size  characteristics and sedimentary
              structures;  (3) analysis of  vertical variations of organic carbon and calcium
              and magnesium  carbonate in flood depositional sequences;  and (4) analysis of 
              slackwater sedimentation in sidevalley tributaries to evaluate  sedimentation
              characteristics as influenced by:  tributary size and  gradient, tributary
              flooding history during and since the 1993  Mississippi flood, and tributary
              junction angle with mainstream  Mississippi Valley.  Analyses of the 1993 flood
              deposits need to be  undertaken as soon as possible because most are located on
              land  that is under agricultural cultivation.  Therefore, it is unlikely  that
              many of the excellent depositional sequences will be available  beyond the
              beginning of the coming growing season when cultivation  for spring planting of
              crops will take place.  Results of the  search will significantly improve the
              methods of paleoflood  hydrology which are based on the geological record of
              flood events  bec ause natural bioturbation and geochemical alterations of 
              sediments in humid climate regions, such as represented by the  upper
              Mississippi Valley, normally make the fine-grained overbank  stratigraphic
              record difficult to interpret in the geological  record.  Hence, documentation
              of fresh, unweathered, and relatively  undisturbed sediments from the rare,
              large-magnitude 1993 flood  will be particularly beneficial for improved
              understanding of key  physical evidence that should be sought in the geologic
              record  where emphasis is on reconstructing past histories of flood  magnitudes
              and frequencies.  Finally, given the important role that  river sediments play
              in geochemical cycles, the results of the  research will also contribute
              significantly to improved  understanding of long-term sediment mobility and
              storage in  alluvial systems.
