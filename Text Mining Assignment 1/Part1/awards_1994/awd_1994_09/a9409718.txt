Abstract    :
              Matching funds are provided for the purchase of a state-of-  the-art x-ray
              fluorescence spectrometer to be used in  support of research in the areas of
              materials and minerals  at Michigan Technological University. Primary users
              will be  faculty and graduate students from the Department of  Metallurgical
              and Materials Engineering, with significant  use also from the Department of
              Geological Engineering,  Geology and Geophysics. Research programs in the
              materials  area requiring the new spectrometer include studies of: 
              structure-property-composition relationships in  intermetallics, austempered
              ductile irons, and mechanically  alloyed materials; macrosegregation in
              castings;  microstructural development in multi-component oxide  systems; means
              of minimizing hexavalent chromium effects in  steelmaking refractories;
              parameters for powder forging low  alloy steels; compositional effects in grain
              boundary  segregation; and welding electrode wear mechanisms. Programs  in
              geology that would use the new instrument include studies  of: volcanic ash and
              rock; paleomagnetic effects in rocks  and sediments; techniques of enhanced
              petroleum recovery;  ground water effects related to fluid flow in porous media
               and remediation strategies; and the Precambrian rocks in the  Lake Superior
              basin. The new instrument would replace a 16-  year-old spectrometer in the
              x-ray analytical facility at  the University. The old instrument, which has
              been used  heavily by a large number of users, is no longer reliable,  and is
              inadequate for current and future projects requiring  analyses of a large
              number of samples with greater  precision, accuracy, and much lower detection
              levels.
