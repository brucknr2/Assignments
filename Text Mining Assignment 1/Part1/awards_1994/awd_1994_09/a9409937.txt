Abstract    :
              9409937  Stutts  Analytical modeling of the ultrasonic traveling wave motor will
               be performed.  The contact dynamics between the stator and rotor  will be
              modeled by using classical plate theory, and Hertzian and  non-Hertzian contact
              mechanics.  Modeling of the stator and  piezoelectric elements will be done
              utilizing a modified  composite plate theory.  The model will be used to
              develop  simpler control schemes for these motors and will be validated by 
              tests at an industrial participant's laboratories.  ***
