Abstract    :
              9409344  Sox       The objectives of this research are to develop mathematical  
              models and solution procedures for dynamically planning and   scheduling
              manufacturing and distribution inventories of multiple   products with random
              demand and finite production capacity.    Dynamic implies the planning and
              scheduling are done in rolling   horizon.  The production capacity at each
              stage in a given time   period may be augmented in a given time period with
              overtime or   additional shift.  The distribution system may be a single
              finished   goods warehouse or a two level system with a central warehouse and  
              multiple, nonidentical retailers.  General distributions that   account for
              seasonality and are non-stationary are used.  The   research seeks to develop
              benchmarks for evaluating the performance   of the developed algorithms both in
              the quality of the solutions   and the time to compute a solution.       The
              models and algorithms developed in this research will   offer a methodology to
              integrate and centralize the planning and   scheduling of production and
              distribution systems.  The resulting   tools will also provide a means to
              assess the value of such a   planning system.  Furthermore, the developed
              planning and   scheduling methodology can supplement just-in-time (JIT) control
              by   leveling out variation in load and mix.
