Abstract    :
              9422271  Kauppila       The focus of this project is to investigate the
              scattering  of positrons by atoms and molecules to obtain fundamental 
              information concerning the interaction of antimatter with matter.  Topics to be
              studied include the differential cross section for  positron scattering from
              rare gases and methane, scattering from  hydrogen and alkali-metal atoms and
              positronium formation.  ***
