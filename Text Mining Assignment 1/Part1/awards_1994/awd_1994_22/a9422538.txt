Abstract    :
              9422538  Jalali  Instabilities in current flow in semiconductors has been of
              interest of some time.  A well known example is the technologically important
              Gunn effect which has been observed in direct bandgap semiconductors such as
              InP and GaAs in which the electric field profile of a biased n+-n-n+ diode
              collapses into a high field domain.  This domain is swept out of the n-region
              in a characteristic time, t and results in current pulses of frequency f=1/t.  
               Since the first observation of the transferred electron effect by Gunn in 1963
              the devices have been successfully implemented as low noise source of microwave
              and millimeter-wave radiation.  The similarity between the collector region of
              a III-V heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) and the drift region of a Gunn
              diode has motivated us to explore the Gunn-Hilsum phenomenon in bipolar
              transistors.  Using numerical simulations, we have shown that current
              instabilities resulting from the transferred electron effect can be observed in
              modified HBT structures in which the electric field profile in the collector
              has been  properly engineered.  These results have established design criteria
              for a new three terminal bipolar oscillator with the potential for
              incorporation into existing HBT integrated circuit technology, which we shall
              study in the this project.    The proposed device will be used as a novel
              spectroscopic tool in which it is possible to independently vary voltage and
              current flow in the region of semiconductor where stability occurs.  Using this
              property we can apply a wide range of bias conditions to assess the
              applicability of the Landau-Ginzburg theory of phase transitions to describe
              fluctuations near oscillation threshold.  ***
