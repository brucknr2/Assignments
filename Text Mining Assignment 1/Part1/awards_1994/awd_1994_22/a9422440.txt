Abstract    :
              9422440  Henderson    This project has two interrelated parts.  The first
              examines the  effect of air quality regulation on decisions of firms concerning
               the location of their plants, the scheduling of production, and  the size of
              their plants.  The project tests the hypotheses that  implementation of air
              quality regulations has led firms to move  plants from more polluted locations
              to less polluted locations,  move plants from states with more intense
              implementation of  regulations to those with easier conditions, implicitly 
              reschedule economic activity over the course of the day to help  minimize
              extreme value air quality readings, and downsize plants  to avoid regulatory
              scrutiny.  The results of this study will  improve our understanding of the
              unintended and overall effects  of environmental regulatory activity. 
              Specifically, the  investigation will help show whether the Clean Air Act
              reduces  emissions or just moves them around.      The second part involves a
              more extensive examination of plant  productivity determinants and location
              decisions of firms.  The  focus of the work is first on establishing the
              existence of  dynamic externalities which help bind clusters of plants to the 
              same locations over the years and then on quantifying the  magnitude and length
              (lag structure) to dynamic externalities.   Dynamic externalities are a
              critical component to determining the  mobility and productivity of plants and
              to understanding the  organization of production across space and within
              corporations.  This project uses EPA and County Business Patterns data
              collected  under prior NSF projects and longitudinal individual firm and  plant
              data, available through the EPA and through the Center for  Economic Studies
              (CES) of the Census Bureau in the Research Data  Center at the Boston regional
              office.
