Abstract    :
                This award will support a U.S.-France workshop on Operads and Homotopical
              Algebra to take place in Luminy, France, May 29 - June 2, 1995.  The organizers
              of the workshop are James D. Stasheff of the University of North Carolina and
              Jean-Louis Loday of the Institute for Research in Advanced Mathematics,
              Strasbourg, France.    The objective of the workshop is to bring together
              American, French and other Western European mathematicians for discussions on
              new research directions on operad and its applications.  An operad is a
              mathematical device which models many kinds of algebras  There is renewed
              interest in the topic due to discovery of its relationships to other fields in
              mathematics (e.g., representation theory, graph cohomology, moduli spaces) and
              its application in statistical mechanics, theoretical physics and string
              theory.  The workshop takes advantage of the interests and  varied expertise of
              U.S. and Western European researchers.  It will enhance interactions among the
              researchers and lead to future collaborations.
