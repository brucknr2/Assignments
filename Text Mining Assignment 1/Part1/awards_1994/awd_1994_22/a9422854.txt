Abstract    :
              9422854  Parkinson      In the spectral region 175-205 nm, the penetration of
              solar radiation into the atmosphere is controlled by the absorption of the
              Schumann-Runge bands of molecular oxygen and some fraction of the transmitted
              radiation is available to photodissociate nitric oxide (NO) molecules in bands
              below 192 nm. In this project, measurements of the NO cross sections will be
              extended below 185 nm by using a unique vacuum ultraviolet (VUV)  Fourier
              Transform (FT) spectrometer in combination with a synchrotron radiation source
              at the Photon Factory, in Tsukuba, Japan.  The high resolution of the
              spectrometer is necessary for the determination of the absolute cross sections
              of molecular bands possessing distinct rotational structure. These absorption
              cross sections are needed to accurately calculate the NO dissociation rates in
              the middle atmosphere.
