Abstract    :
              This research extends traditional public goods theory by  examining the
              connectivity and communality properties of  communication and information-based
              public goods.  This  pilot study supports the development of methods and 
              instruments to conduct a longitudinal examination of  communication and
              information-based public goods.  The  research is motivated by the specific
              example of a large  interorganizational computer-supported collaborative work 
              system.  This type of information-based collective action is  theorized to
              possess two properties that are uniquely  important to communication forms of
              collective goods:  connectivity and communality.  Marwell and Oliver's (1993) 
              theoretical framework integrates four characteristics of  public goods:  the
              good itself, individuals, the groups or  organizations involved with the good,
              and the action  process.  The research is designed to test hypotheses that 
              link collective action theory, communication and information  systems, and
              collaborative work processes and effects.
