Abstract    :
              Affect and emotion have been actively studied in psychology for  more than a
              century, yet few studies have examined the role of  affect in technological
              risk assessment.  This research develops  and tests a theory that portrays
              affect and cognitive worldviews  as functionally similar, working in parallel
              to help experts and  laypersons cope with complexity and uncertainty in the
              face of  risk.  Quantitative measures of affect will be developed and used  in
              empirical studies of expert and lay judgments about  technological risks.  The
              theoretical and empirical insights  obtained from this work should lead to a
              better appreciation of  how laypersons and experts derive meaning from risk
              information  and experience.
