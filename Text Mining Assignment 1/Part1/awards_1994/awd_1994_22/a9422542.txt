Abstract    :
              9422542       The remote mountainous areas of Northern Laos and  Northwestern
              Vietnam are home to a number of little-known  ethnolinguistic communities
              speaking languages of the Northern  Mon-Khmer family. Internationally isolated
              for decades, the area  remains until now a virtual terra incognita to western
              scholars  of linguistics, ethnography, folklore, and history. This project-  
              to be carried out by an interdisciplinary, international team of  researchers,
              working closely with colleagues from Lao and  Vietnamese research institutions-
              will take advantage of new  opportunities for collaborative field
              investigations in the two  countries.       The focus of study will be several
              ethnolinguistic  communities whose members speak languages within the Khmuic
              and  Palaungic branches of the Mon-Khmer family (i.e., the Northern  Division
              of Mon-Khmer).  The research, primarily descriptive and  empirical in approach,
              will include eliciting lengthy word lists  suitable for comparative study, as
              well as gathering other  linguistic data; recording linguistic texts including
              songs,  folktales, myths, ritual languages, play languages, and other 
              traditional verbal arts; and interviewing community members about  the
              traditions and history of each ethnicity. The research  promises to make
              important contributions to understanding the  linguistic and ethnographic
              history and relations not only of the  particular ethnic groups studied, but of
              the region as a whole.  The languages to be studied will also provide rich data
              for  consideration of problems of interest to general linguistics such  as the
              relations of register and tone, tonogenetic mechanisms and  processes,
              person-referring forms (pronouns, kinship terms, and  so on) and
              group-referring forms (ethnonyms and glossonyms), play  languages and speech
              surrogates, and reduplication and  parallelism.
