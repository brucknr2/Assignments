Abstract    :
              9422771  Biswas       This group of 3 faculty and a senior research staff 
              member at the University of Notre Dame and 4 graduate  students participate in
              experimental operations at Fermilab  (FNAL) with the DO group.  Their
              particular interests are  top quark properties and processes that confront QCD 
              predictions in antiproton-proton annihilations.  They also  are intensely
              involved in design and construction of new  tracking instrumentation to be
              installed in the DO detector  as a component of the current upgrade project. 
              For  application at future accelerators they pursue R&D to  improve tracking
              capabilities at higher intensity, higher  energy environments.  ***
