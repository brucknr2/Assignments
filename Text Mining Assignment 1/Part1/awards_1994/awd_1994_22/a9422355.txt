Abstract    :
              9422355  ROBESON       Wind-generated electricity has been viewed as one of the 
              least expensive and most abundant forms of energy.  Although  considerable
              attention has been given to overcoming technological  impediments to its use,
              far less work has been undertaken to  explore the physical characteristics of
              wind that affect its  utility as an energy resource.  Foremost among those 
              characteristics is the variability of wind over a variety of  geographic and
              temporal scales.  The continued development of  wind resources therefore
              requires better understanding of the  influence of climatic variability and
              possible climatic change on  the intra-annual and inter-annual variability of
              wind.  This  project will explore methodological issues inherent in the 
              development of more accurate and more finely refined wind  resource maps by
              explicitly considering the effects of regional  wind variability, including
              statistical analyses of trends,  periodicities, and autocorrelation.  It will
              examine temporal  variations over shorter time periods, using data gathered
              from  1961 through 1990 at a number of climatic stations in the  northern Great
              Plains states of North Dakota and South Dakota to  develop time series of wind
              power using one-hour, daily, and  monthly average wind speeds.  Following
              generation of those time  series, they will be statistically decomposed into a
              number of  components, including linear, daily, and seasonal trends.  These 
              components will be used to explore new forms of time-series  models for wind
              power.       This pilot project will facilitate refinement of statistical 
              approaches that can be used to improve knowledge about factors  that affect
              wind variability.  This new knowledge should provide  the basis for updating
              maps of wind resources in the U.S., and it  will permit refined assessments of
              the potential for developing  wind as an energy resource in different parts of
              the nation.
