Abstract    :
              9422216  Williams    The research to be carried out will have an impact on (1)
              extragalactic  astronomy: the structure and energy generation of quasars and
              other  active galactic nuclei (AGN) are investigated, on (2) cosmology: the 
              formation of galaxies in the early Universe are investigated, and on (3)  a
              combination of galactic astronomy and cosmology: dark matter and  gamma-ray
              bursts are investigated.  The project involves theoretical,  numerical, and
              statistical investigations.     In Part I of this project, the physics of
              general relativistic,  supermassive Kerr-Newman black holes are used to model
              AGN.  Monte Carlo  simulations of Penrose processes are used to model the
              extraction of  energy from the ergosphere; and large scale electromagnetic
              fields are  used to generate the jets.  In Part II, electromagnetic and
              gravitational  fields in a Friedmann cosmology are used to model the formation
              of  supermassive stars, near the time of recombination in the early Universe.  
                 In Part III, low energy black holes of negligible emissions will be used  to
              model dark matter in the Universe.     Finally, in Part IV, black holes that
              undergo periods of being active and  inactive are used to model gamma-ray
              bursters.     The objective of the research is (1) to show that the Kerr-Newman
              black  holes can explain the energy source of AGN; (2) to show how rotation, 
              magnetic fields, and particle-field interactions can produce the  necessary
              gravitational instabilities needed in the early Universe to  allow the
              formation of supermassive stars of approximately 10 Million  Solar masses
              (these stars could be the progenitors of the supermassive  black holes believed
              to power AGN); and (3) to show that using black  holes to model two poorly
              understood phenomena in the Universe: dark  matter and gamma-ray bursts, can
              give promising results in explaining the  nature of the original sources.
