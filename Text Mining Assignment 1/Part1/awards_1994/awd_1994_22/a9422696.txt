Abstract    :
              9422696  Belyschko    Health monitoring and assessment of steel bridges and
              other steel facilities offers tremendous potential benefits if used to asses
              the safety and reliability and to extend the remaining useful life by timely
              repairs.  This project involves the development of high performance computing
              tools for identifying flaws in critical bridge components form the output of
              nondestructive evaluation (NDE) sensing devices and assessing the impact of
              these flaws on the useful life of the component.    High performance computing
              tools will be developed to provide a characterization of flaws from the output
              of NDE sensors and asses the reliability of the component.  The proposed
              research addresses this objective in an integrated approach which will involve
              the following tasks:    1. adapting ultrasonic QNDE methods to in situ health
              monitoring of  bridges;  2. the solution of the inverse problem of identifying
              and  characterizing the crack, which will be accomplished with the aid of 
              neural networks;  3. development of high fidelity forward solutions of the wave
              equation  for detailed models with one or more cracks, which are needed for 
              the identification process; because of the large size of these  problems,
              parallel computations will be used;  4. estimating the reliability of a
              component in terms of the crack  which is identified.    Testing of the overall
              model will take place on test prototypes and on actual bridges.  Working groups
              form various states and several interested companies will be set up to
              facilitate dissemination of the research results to practice.
