Abstract    :
              The PI proposes to investigate the role of ambiguity in multi-attribute decision
              making.  Although most prior research has found ambiguity aversion in decision
              making, this PI has found ambiguity seeking using medical decision making
              scenarios.  This research program will attempt to discover whether the
              ambiguity seeking behavior will generalize to non-medical situations. 
              Ambiguity will be created in various ways in the scenarios, the scenarios will
              differ in their number of attributes, the salience of the ambiguity will be
              varied, and the information processing load on the subjects will be
              manipulated.  In addition, the PI will investigate the location of the status
              quo and the influence of decision goals with regard to the subjects' reaction
              to ambiguity.
