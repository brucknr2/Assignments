Abstract    :
              SBR-9422763  Boyan Jovanovic and Yaw Nyarko      It is common practice in
              economics to specify the production function of the firm independently of the
              process of human capital accumulation.  This research shows that many forms of
              technological change-- learning by doing, learning by watching, learning by
              research and learning by copying-- imply that output production function and
              the human capital accumulation process must have common parameters.  This, in
              turn, implies that an understanding of how human capital grows requires
              knowledge of the production process.  Furthermore, (a) the level and growth of
              individual's earnings will depend on the nature of the work done, (b) the level
              and growth of productivity at the plant or firm level will depend on the nature
              of the production process, (c) the level and growth of human capital of
              countries or regions will depend on the sectoral composition of production. 
              This research sheds light on these relationships.
