Abstract    :
              Mital   This is a follow-up workshop on the role of ergonomics and humans in the
              design for manufacture and the operation of advanced manufacturing technology
              systems.  The first workshop was held on November, 1993, at the University of
              Cincinnati, Ohio.  At that conference, a number of objectives were pursued,
              including the exploration of the role of humans in advanced manufacturing, the
              identification of research issues relevant to human performance and efficiency
              in a hybrid manufacturing systems, and the prioritization of research needs
              identified.  Another key objective was to use the results of the workshop to
              prepare a report which NSF can use as a guide to focus and prioritize on
              research funding needs in the area of design of hybrid manufacturing systems
              and design for manufacture.  The objective of the current workshop is to
              complete some unfinished work at the first meeting.  Specifically, the aim is
              to convert the research issues identified in the earlier workshop into specific
              problem statements that can be disseminated to researchers in the field.   The
              effective use of humans in the operations of high technology, high investment
              manufacturing systems is critical to maintaining the up times of such systems
              and consequently, improve their economic viability and competitiveness.  The
              workshop will help provide some insights on what the critical problems are in
              man-machine systems,  It will also provide a better understanding of  the
              research obstacles that must be overcome to see notable progress in the area.
