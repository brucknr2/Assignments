Abstract    :
              9422169  Blum   This award provides partial (60%) funding for the acquisition of
              a multi-collector thermal ionization source mass spectrometer to be installed
              and operated in the Department of Earth Sciences at Dartmouth College. The
              institution is committed to providing the remaining funds necessary for this
              instrument acquisition.    The equipment is to be used primarily in the
              research and teaching programs of nine faculty members in the Department of
              Earth Sciences at Dartmouth who have a need for accurate measurements of
              radiogenic isotopes. Their current research projects include: (1) Mineral
              weathering studies, soil formation processes and marine strontium evolution;
              (2) Base cation cycling in forest ecosystems; (3) Anthropogenic lead mobility
              in soil and ground water; (4) Geochemistry of terrestrial impacts; (5)
              Petrogenesis of granite and metamorphic rocks; and (6) Establishment of
              migratory patterns for long-distance migrant songbirds.  ***
