Abstract    :
              9422288  Lobo     This award is to purchase a real-time vision system to assist
              research in three projects: 1) Classify Human Age from Faces; 2) Visual Gesture
              Recognition; and 3) Multi-frame Order Statistics in Image Processing.     In
              the first project, the research addresses the limited task of age
              classification of a facial image into a baby, young adult, and senior adult. 
              It addresses the difficult issues of age classification of faces that are
              engaged in activity, i.e., not simply mugshots.     The second project
              investigates performing gesture recognition based on motion information.  The
              current library of gestures contains seven gestures:  Left, Right, Up, Down,
              Rotate, Grab, and Stop.  It is proposed to extend the  method to 3-D gesture
              recognition.  A 3-D hand model using Generalized Cylinders, will be employed
              and motion parameters will be estimated to compute 3-D hand trajectories. 
              Gesture recognition becomes more realistic with a 3-D, rather than a 2-D,
              approach.     The third project deals with the real-time performance of
              multi-frame order statistics involving median filtering.  It is proposed to
              extend median and order statistic based filtering to 3-D by using
              spatio-temporal filtering (multiple successive images).  It is also proposed to
              extend methods for suppression of narrow-band (periodic) interference to 2-D
              (for images).
