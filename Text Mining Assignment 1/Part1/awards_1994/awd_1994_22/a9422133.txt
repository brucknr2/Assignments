Abstract    :
                ABSTRACT    CTS -- 9422133       A five-day workshop on "Fouling Mitigation
              for Industrial Heat Exchange Equipment" will be held in the Summer, 1995.  The
              workshop will consider one of the major fouling types during each day of the
              conference. Attendance is projected to be 80-100 persons. The meeting will be
              cosponsored by the Engineering Foundation, ASME and  AIChE with additional
              industrial input from HTRI and HTFS. The research area of industrial heat
              exchanger fouling was identified by the NSF-supported worshop on Thermal
              Engineering: Emerging Technologies and Critical Phenomena as a high priority
              research area.
