Abstract    :
              9422226  Klaiber  About one-half of the approximately 600,000 highway bridges in
               the United States were built before 1940 and many have not been  adequately
              maintained.  Deterioration caused by environmental  factors has added to the
              problem.  According to the FHWA, 40% of  the nation's bridges are classified as
              deficient and in need of  rehabilitation or replacement.  In lieu of
              replacement in  numerous instances strengthening has been determined to be a
              cost-  effective alternative. Many researchers institutes, university,  and
              consulting offices have developed various efficient bridge  rehabilitation and
              strengthening procedures.  To provide a forum  for disseminating "tried and
              true" rehabilitation and  strengthening procedures practicing bridge engineers,
              an NSF-  sponsored symposium was held in Des Moines, Iowa in April 1993.   
              There is need for a second bridge strengthening/rehabilitation  symposium in
              that there are still major bridge problems and a  considerable amount of design
              and research has been completed  within the last two years.  Therefore, a
              second symposium, open  to all interested engineers, will be followed by a
              workshop of  invited participants to formulate a manual on bridge 
              strengthening and rehabilitation based on the presentations at  both
              symposiums.  The final manual will be prepared by the  symposium steering
              committee and made available to designers in  both public and private practice.
