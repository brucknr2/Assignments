Abstract    :
              9422765  Beck  The purpose of this research is to develop a theoretical and 
              empirical foundation for the liquidity demand for money.  This  research
              extends the investigator's previous work on the theory  of the value of money. 
              In that work money was modelled as a call  option on capital gains
              opportunities in securities.  Two stages  of research are planned. The first is
              to incorporate the  liquidity value of money in a simple intertemporal general 
              equilibrium model to derive the liquidity demand for money  function.  This
              macroeconomic model will be used as the basis for  extensions to more realistic
              applications in future research.   The second stage is to estimate the money
              demand function implied  by the theory.  Since the function changes over the
              range of  interest rates, regime-switching time series techniques will be 
              investigated.  Evidence will be obtained on the validity of this  theory of
              liquidity demand.  The results of this study will  determine the feasibility of
              modelling the liquidity demand for  money based on this theory; they will also
              serve as a foundation  for future research on other applications of the option
              value  approach to pricing liquidity.  ***
