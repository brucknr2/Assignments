Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to analyze some of the  difficulties encountered
              in the transition from a planned to  market economy.  The first issue to be
              analyzed is what happens  to firm specific knowledge or organizational capital
              as state run  firms are replaced by private ones.  A growth model of industry 
              evolution and transition is developed and used with panel data on  the patterns
              of birth, growth, and death of manufacturing plants  to estimate the scale of
              investment in organizational capital.  Another issue to be analyzed is the
              initial and usually  significant drop in total output that occurs in converting
              to a  market system.  This drop in output is modeled as arising from  the
              changes in managers' and workers' incentives that arise as  their rents are
              redistributed as a result of economic reform.   Finally, the potential role
              that changes in energy prices might  play in explaining the transition path of
              the former socialist  economies is analyzed.  A model of production is
              developed to  assess the impact of energy price changes on energy use, total 
              output, productivity, investment, and employment.  ***
