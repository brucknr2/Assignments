Abstract    :
              Schneiderman  9422143  During the development of the neuromuscular system, a
              series of  complex interactions are involved in the specification of the 
              pattern of innervation of any specific muscle.  This research is  designed to
              elucidate the sequence of events that result in the  development of the
              appropriate connections between neurons and  muscles.  To address this problem
              a novel invertebrate system will  be employed.  The innervation of muscles will
              be studied during the  process of metamorphosis, when degenerating muscles are
              being  replaced with newly formed muscles.  In particular, the role of 
              hypothesized "muscle pioneer cells" in neural specification will be  examined. 
              The results of this research will provide basic  information about the major
              steps involved in the development of  connections between neurons and muscles,
              as well as insight into  the plasticity inherent in the developing and
              regenerating  neuromuscular system.
