Abstract    :
              9422044  Fischer     This award is to purchase high-performance networking and
              computing equipment which will be dedicated to support research in computer and
              information science and engineering.  The equipment will be used for several
              research projects, including the following:  Video compression algorithms will
              be developed for packet-switched networks, emphasizing robustness to packet
              loss and development of quantization methods that achieve most of the available
              granular and entropy gains.  Distributed algorithms for computer vision will be
              developed, including techniques for parallel verification of hypotheses in
              three-dimensional object recognition, and techniques for high-performance
              sampling of discrete Markov Random Field models.  A "virtual reality VCR"
              system, which was proposed as a mechanism for image-based recording and
              immersive playback of virtual environments, with particular emphasis on
              scientific documentation, will be prototyped. Finally, new techniques will be
              developed for recurrent design and automatic recurrent modeling of shapes in
              natural images.  ***
