Abstract    :
              Hudson/Abstract           Two research aircraft will be coordinated with the
              CP-2 dual  wavelength radar, which will direct the aircraft to clouds with 
              developing coalescence and will provide a time history of cloud  outline and
              liquid water content.  Detailed cloud droplet and drop  spectra measurements
              from the two aircraft will trace the  development of coalescence.         The
              two DRI instantaneous CCN (cloud condensation nuclei)  spectrometers with
              calibration equipment will be mounted on the  NCAR C-130.  At times these two
              instruments will redundantly  monitor the ambient aerosol but for most of the
              time one  spectrometer will monitor the counterflow virtual impactor (CVI) in 
              order to determine the spectrum of nuclei within cloud droplets.   This will
              help ascertain the effect of entrainment on the cloud  droplet spectrum and
              will help differentiate homogeneous,  inhomogeneous, and entity mixing
              processes.  Comparisons of the CCN  spectra and the spectra of updraft
              velocities will determine the  influence of the aerosol on droplet spectra. 
              This basic cloud  forming experiment with comparisons of model predictions of
              droplet  spectra with observations of droplet spectra will yield a better 
              definition of CCN--the important critical supersaturations (Sc).        
              Detailed comparisons of drop (>50 Mm) and droplet (<50 Mm)  spectra will
              determine the influence of each on the other.  The  fact that these
              measurements can be made in time sequence before  and after coalescence (before
              and after the existence of drops)  allows cause and effect to be separated with
              respect to droplet and  drop spectra.  After coalescence has taken effect the
              CCN spectra  will be affected.  SCMS will yield the opportunity to follow in 
              time sequence so that the aerosol can be traced before and after  coalescence
              scavenging has occurred.
