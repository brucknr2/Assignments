Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry  
              Program supports research by Dr. Jacqueline K. Barton of the Department   of
              Chemistry, California Institute of Technology, for the construction of  
              metal-peptide complexes targeted to double helical DNA.  Oligopeptides   will
              be synthesized and coupled onto metallointercalators which have high   binding
              affinity for the major groove of DNA.  These intercalators will   position the
              appended peptide to bind specifically to other DNA sites.    The
              oligopeptides-- which are derived from the recognition elements of   DNA
              binding proteins such as phage 434 and P(22) repressors and the zinc   finger
              domain of Sp1--as well as the rhodium-containing intercalators   will govern
              the recognition characteristics. The intercalator, peptide,   and the linkage
              between the two will be varied to target specific DNA   sites.   Cleavage of
              the DNA strand by photoactivation of the   metallointercalator followed by
              chemical footprinting will be used to   determine binding locations.  The long
              term goal of the project is the   development of an array of small
              metal-peptide complexes which bind DNA   with predicatable
              sequence-specificities.  This research will contribute to understanding the
              principles of   recognition of nucleic acids by proteins, as well as develop
              some   vehicles to effect selective interaction of proteins with nucleic acids.
                 The results will be relevant to the design of therapeutic agents and  
              advanced clinical testing.
