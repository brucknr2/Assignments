Abstract    :
              9422195  Healey     This award is to purchase computer equipment which will be
              dedicated to support research in computer and information science and
              engineering.  This equipment will be used for several research projects,
              including in particular: 1) Image modeling and segmentation; 2) Algorithms for
              estimating illumination-invariant properties of objects; 3) Algorithms for
              estimating geometry-invariant properties of objects; and 4) Algorithms for cue
              integration for object recognition.     The four workstations will be used for
              the development of new color image models and associated algorithms for the
              estimation of object properties which are invariant to an object's environment.
               New random field models will be developed that describe physically relevant
              interactions within and between bands of a color image.  These image models
              will be parametrized by surface properties and scene conditions and will be
              used for image segmentation. Algorithms will also be developed which compute
              illumination-invariant and geometry-invariant properties of objects.  These
              models and algorithms will be used by methods that rigorously combine estimated
              properties for object recognition.  The proposed equipment will also allow
              experimentation with the developed models and algorithms on large databases to
              characterize performance and to suggest areas for future research.  ***
