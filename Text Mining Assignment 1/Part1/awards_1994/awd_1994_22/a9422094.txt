Abstract    :
              9422094  Farag     Researchers at the University of Louisville will purchase
              equipment for research in the area of Computer Vision and Image Processing
              (CVIP).  The equipment will be used for several projects including the
              following: 1) 3-D Model Building in Computer Vision: New Approaches and
              Applications; 2) Integrated Image Segmentation; 3) Large Image Manipulation in
              Support of Optical Pattern Recognition; and 4) Fractional Brownian Motion for
              Representing Natural Image Texture.     The main components of the laboratory
              are: 1) Hardware for 3-D data acquisition and analysis (Silicon Graphics Iris
              Indigo 200/100MHz; 2) 3-D scanner for object scanning (Cyberware 3030-RGB/PS 3D
              Scanner&Table Bundle); 3) still-image capturing & display (Pullnix digital
              Camera, HP-C2732A X-terminals & Tektronix 3D display); and 4) image printing
              equipment (Codonics NP600 color dye sublimation printer, and slide write
              Polaroid CI-5000).  ***
