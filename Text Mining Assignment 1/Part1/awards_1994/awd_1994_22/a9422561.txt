Abstract    :
              9422561  Leng      This project will investigate four pairs of nation-states
              which  have been engaged in recurring militarized crises in the Post WW  II
              era:  the United States and the Soviet Union, India and  Pakistan, Israel and
              Egypt, and Israel and Syria.  these  rivalries account for eight of the
              eighteen wars that occurred  between 1945 and 1980, as well as three nuclear
              confrontations.   The investigation will attempt to discover whether
              significant  changes in influence strategies and tactics are employed from one 
              crisis to the next.  Event data from the Behavioral Correlates of  war project
              as well as attributes of participant states, their  relationship with rival
              states, and the structure of the  international system and regional subsystem
              will inform the  study.  It will identify whether lessons are learned from 
              preceding experiences with the same adversary, and the conditions  under which
              more or less effective crisis management evolves.  A  better understanding of
              the "lessons" that policy makers draw  from experience may provide an important
              step toward more  effective means of managing future militarized crises.  ***
