Abstract    :
              It  is a joint initiative between the Engineering Directorate and  the  Computer
               Information  and  Engineering  Directorate.   This  research  involves  a 
              collaboration among roboticists,  computer  scientists,  biomechanicists, and 
              surgeons  at  Carnegie  Mellon  University and Shadyside Hospital to advance
              the state-of-the-art  in  medical  robotics.  Robotics and computer-based 
              technologies  present medicine with excellent opportunities to improve surgical
               practice.  Surgical robots are particularly well suited for  such  medical
              fields as orthopaedics in which there is a clinical  need  for  accurate
              execution of biomechanics-based preoperative plans.  To  fully  realize the
              promise of medical robotics, advances  are  still needed to develop: (1)
              surgical simulators that incorporate  the  complex  biomechanics of biological
              systems, (2)  clinically  practical surgical cutting and registration
              techniques,  and  (3)  effective    methods   for   preoperative   and   
              intraoperative  human-computer interaction.   The interdisciplinary research
              team  will  create  advanced  numerical  simulation  capabilities   for 
              orthopaedics,  robotic techniques for surface-based  registration  and 
              high-speed  3-D sensing, and human-computer interfaces  that  present 
              biomechanical  and  intraoperative  information   in   a  clinically 
              meaningful  manner.  These advances  will  complement  surgeons' abilities with
              realistic surgical simulators  and  less  traumatic  robotic  tools for
              implementing surgical  plans.   The  project  targets  total  joint 
              replacement  surgery,  with   the  expectation  of broader impact on the
              emerging field  of  medical  robotics  and beyond. With high performance
              computing serving  as  the   glue,  the integration of these component
              technologies will  lead to the next generation of computer-assisted surgical
              robots.
