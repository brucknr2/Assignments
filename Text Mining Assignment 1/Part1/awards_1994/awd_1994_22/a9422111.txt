Abstract    :
              9422111  Crossin  The development of the nervous system is dependent upon
              coordinated  interactions among specialized cells including neurons, glia and 
              other types of support cells, and of these cells with surrounding 
              extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Cell attachment and migration  as well as
              neurite outgrowth, guidance, and fasciculation are all  affected by interaction
              of cells with components of the ECM during  both development and regeneration.
              This research focuses on  analyzing a specific ECM protein, called
              cytotactin/tenascin, and  its interaction with nerve cells and with other
              matrix components.   This molecule is particularly interesting because it has
              been shown  to promote cell growth under some conditions and to inhibit growth 
              under others.  The results of these studies should reveal  mechanisms of
              neurite outgrowth promotion by molecules present in  regenerating nerves and
              also promise to shed light on general  mechanisms of cellular guidance and
              repair occurring during  development and regeneration of the nervous system.
