Abstract    :
              9422375  Niemi    How term limits affect legislative representation was
              addressed  as early as the debate surrounding the adoption of the 
              Constitution, but the matter was then largely set aside for 200  years. 
              Beginning with California in 1990, however, some sixteen  states have enacted
              term limits for their state legislative or  congressional representatives, and
              additional states are likely  to enact such limits in the near future.  Owing
              to this recent  timing, most writings about the topic are prescriptive, but the
               arguments are intense and the claims are grandiose.    This project is the
              first large-scale study of the actual effects  of term limits,  The
              investigators will focus on the state  legislative level.  The heart of the
              project consists of: a) a  mail survey of all state legislators as of spring
              1995; b)  personal interviews during 1995 with legislators and key  political
              observers in four states, one highly professionalized  legislature with term
              limits, one more amateur legislature with  term litis, and one of each type
              without term limits.  In  addition, the investigators will make use of data on
              state  legislative elections as well as other published data about  legislators
              and the legislatures.    This project should substantially enhance our
              understanding of  this interesting and important topic.  ***
