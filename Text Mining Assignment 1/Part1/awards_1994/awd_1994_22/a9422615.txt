Abstract    :
                    9422615  Thompson  The phloem tissue plays a central role in the
              long-distance  transport of carbohydrates, hormones, amino acids, and other 
              organic compounds that are essential for plant growth.  A  further
              understanding of the molecular basis for the  structural and physiological
              changes that occur during  phloem differentiation will provide a basis for the 
              development of innovative methods to improve plant growth  and productivity. 
              P-proteins are an intergral component of  sieve elements in most plants,
              however the significance of  these proteins in phloem development and function
              has not  been experimentally tested.  The ultimate goal of this  proposed
              project is to determine the role(s) of two P-  proteins, PP1 and PP2, in 
              phloem physiology.    Dr. Thompson will test the hypotheqis that P-protein 
              filaments plug wounded sieve elements maintaining turgor  within the sieve tube
              to preserve the functional integrity  of the phloem.  The proposed experiments
              are also designed  to evaluate physiological roles for P-proteins during phloem
               differentiation in unwounded plants.
