Abstract    :
              9422664  Klemp   Gas chromatography is the most widely used method for the
              chemical analysis of volatile organic compounds.  This research is to develop
              an instrument for high-speed gas chromatography by 1) engineering a modular
              inlet system, 2) investigating a dual-mode sample introduction system, 3)
              investigating a mid-column backflush system, 4) engineering a modular
              high-speed GC system, 5) evaluation of capacity factor reproducibility, and 6)
              enhancement of tunable selectivity.  The instrument should be capable of
              analysis times of a few seconds to a few tens of seconds.   Gas chromatography
              is at present, used extensively for the analysis of chemical manufacturing
              process streams, environmental and laboratory samples.  The proposed device
              provides analysis cycle times 10 to 100 times shorter than with the
              conventional instruments, resulting in a dramatic increase in process
              monitoring reliability and environmental and sample throughput.
