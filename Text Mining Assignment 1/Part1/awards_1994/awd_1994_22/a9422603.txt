Abstract    :
              9422603  Tornatzky    This award deals with a workshop which will convene
              upwards of 40 individuals who play prominent roles in NSF State/Industry
              University Cooperative Research Centers.  These include Center Directors, state
              representatives, Center Analysts, Industrial Advisory Board heads, and NSF
              staff.  The Center Analyst position has recently been created in S/IUCRCs, and
              there are different views on the function.  The purpose of the workshop will be
              to:  (1) clarify the role of and expectations for Center Analysts;  (2) discuss
              draft data base format;  and (3) discuss methods that Center Analysts should
              use to collect data.  Accomplishment of this will involve four major work
              tasks:  (1) making meeting arrangements;  (2) preparing background materials; 
              (3) conducting the meeting;  and (4) developing a Summary Report.
