Abstract    :
              Management factors and organizational errors are major  contributors to the risk
              of failure of large complex systems  that often have severe health and
              environmental  consequences.  Environmental policy (both public and  private)
              relies on risk management to forecast  organizational and engineering
              performance as well as a  means for reducing risks.  Modeling in risk
              management,  however, rarely accounts for robust interactions among  human,
              engineering, and environmental systems.  Social  scientists and engineers tend
              to consider risk management  differently and a bridge is needed between the two
              fields to  take full advantage of the research of both.  This research 
              develops a normative risk management model (System-Actions-  Management:  SAM),
              involving both the technical parameters  included in classical Probabilistic
              Risk Analysis (PRA) and  the organizational factors that affect them.  The
              research  extends earlier work on the characterization of the linkage  between
              classical PRA and management factors by emphasizing  the long-term dynamics of
              organizations and facilities.  The  resulting model will allow a more realistic
              and balanced  consideration of social and behavioral factors in risk 
              management decision making and priority setting.
