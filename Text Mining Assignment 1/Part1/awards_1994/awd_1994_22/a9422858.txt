              Abstract  ATM-9422858  Ruddiman, William F.  University of Virginia  Title:
              Holocene and Last-Glacial Burial Fluxes of Charcoal    The burial flux of
              charcoal over large spatial scales remains  basically unknown, both today and
              in the historical and geological  past.  Recent advances in charcoal analysis
              have opened up new  research opportunities, two of which are targeted in this
              project:  (1) a qualification of charcoal bupial rates in the context of 
              global carbon inventories, with an emphasis on establishing  baseline late
              Holocene fluxes prior to the fossil-fuel era; (2) an  exploration of eolian
              charcoal as a paleoclimatic indicator during  the last 20,000 years, with
              particular attention to its use in  distinguishing changes in source-area
              moisture balances from  changes in wind strength.      This award supports the
              following tasks: (1) an effort to quantify  burial fluxes of eolian charcoal
              during the late Holocene and last-  glacial maximum in ocean sediments downwind
              from the major  continents; (2) initial explorations of potentially large
              charcoal  burial rates in a variety of deposits along continental margins;  and
              (3) initial investigation of lacustrine sediments to test the  applicability of
              the new charcoal analysis method and to evaluate  sedimentological
              complications.
