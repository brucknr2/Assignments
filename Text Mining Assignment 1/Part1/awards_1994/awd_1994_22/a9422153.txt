Abstract    :
              9422153                                            This grant will support a
              special session on "The Role of  Prosody in Sentence Parsing" at the Eighth
              Annual CUNY Conference  on Sentence Processing, to be held at the University of
              Arizona  in March, 1995.        Up until recently, by far the majority of 
              sentence-processing research has used visual presentation of  stimuli, in part
              because this makes it possible to timelock the  input to the subject's
              response. But more recently, as computers  and speech editing software have
              increased in capacity and  reduced in price, researchers have begun to examine
              the role of  prosody during the processing of auditorily-presented sentences. 
              This new wave of research circumvents a common worry in  visually-presented
              stimuli: orthographic representations of  language do not adequately represent
              many of the non-segmental  properties of speech and, obviously, speech is the
              more natural  modality for human language. Intuitively, prosodic cues--changes 
              in the pitch, amplitude and duration of syllables and changes in  pause
              length--should be useful to listeners. Whether they  actually are is an
              empirical question which a number of  researchers are currently investigating. 
                   The goal of this special session of the CUNY Sentence  Processing
              Conference is to bring together researchers who are  studying the on-line
              effects of prosody on sentence parsing to  present and synthesize recent
              results, and to raise points of  controversy. We intend to publish these papers
              as part of either  a special issue of the Journal of Psycholinguistic Research
              or a  book.
