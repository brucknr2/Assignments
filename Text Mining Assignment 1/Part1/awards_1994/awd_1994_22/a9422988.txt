Abstract    :
              SBR-9422988  Lones Smith    In most markets buyers and sellers do not meet at
              some central site, but must constantly seek each other out.  Economists usually
              ignore the search process when analyzing market outcomes and simply assume that
              in equilibrium the market-clearing price is common knowledge.  The process by
              which equilibrium is attained and the equilibrium price becomes common
              knowledge is treated as a "black box."  The first part of this research project
              opens up this black box to more careful scrutiny.  The P.I. investigates the
              whole class of employment matching models and provides a coherent theory
              underlying the efficient and equilibrium outcomes when individuals are
              inherently different.    Thirty years ago, Professor George Stigler suggested
              that oligopolies were unstable and proposed a process of "secret" price cuts
              that would seem to cause any oligopoly agreement to unravel toward the
              competitive outcome.  Yet despite many efforts the implicit game remains
              unsolved and so Stigler's conjectured equilibrium remains a conjecture.  All
              the recent progress in this area has been on the quantity-setting version of
              Stigler's game in which prices were observable and output unobservable.  Such
              games have a recursive structure to which dynamic programming can be
              successfully applied.  The second part of this research project is an attempt
              to solve the original much harder Stigler pricing game. This is done indirectly
              by examining an unsolved problem from the search literature known as the
              Rendezvous problem.  This problem has much of the same formal structure as
              Stigler's oligopoly game, namely it is a repeated game with imperfect
              monitoring and privately observed signals, yet appears to be more tractable.
