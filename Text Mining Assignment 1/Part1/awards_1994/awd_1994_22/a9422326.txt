Abstract    :
              This research is designed to develop a broad information base on transformations
              to quality from a large sample of companies within one industry (concrete
              piping).  It will identify practices or combinations of practices related to
              successful transformations, as well as identifying catalysts for, and barriers
              to successful transformation.  The research also will provide benchmark
              information against which future transformations to quality can be assessed,
              and it will identify and isolate the steps necessary to achieve effective
              transformation.  Data will be obtained through a multi-faceted survey of 238
              member facilities of theAmerican Concrete Pipe Association, through surveys of
              over 2,000 customers of these concrete pipe makers, and through intensive
              investigations of approximately five of the facilities.  Information will be
              obtained about the specific quality initiatives in use, the contextual factors
              surrounding the use of these initiatives, the factors that promote or impede
              the success of the quality initiatives, and about perceived and objective
              performance and quality outcomes.  The interdisciplinary research team includes
              both behavioral scientists and engineers.  The primary industry organization
              participating in this study is the American Concrete Pipe Association.
