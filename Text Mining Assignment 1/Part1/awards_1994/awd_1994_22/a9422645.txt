Abstract    :
              Distributive theories, developed to explain Congressional decision making,
              predict that legislatures whose members are elected in single-member district
              representational systems will attempt to return policy benefits to their
              districts in order to gain re-election.  Alternative representational schemes
              are predicted to produce alternative types of policy distributions.   This
              project investigates the connection between the type of election system cities
              use and the distribution of capital improvement projects.  Using a four city
              sample,  this research will evaluate the distribution of expenditures in two
              single-member district and two at-large electoral systems.  Topologically
              Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (TIGER) files together with
              automated Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software will be used to map the
              location of capital improvement expenditures and other critical variables to
              intra-urban regions.  This project will aid in understanding the policy
              implications that result from the choice of electoral systems in U.S. cities. 
              It should also demonstrate the usefulness of GIS for exploring key hypotheses
              in urban politics.
