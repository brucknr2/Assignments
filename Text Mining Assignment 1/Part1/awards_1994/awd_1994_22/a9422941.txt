Abstract    :
              9422941  Rajan  The aim of this research is to elucidate the relationship
              between grain boundary crystallography and grain boundary wetting in mineral
              systems.  The specific experimental focus is determination of the
              crystallography characteristics and orientation relationships of grains that
              have their mutual boundary wetted and comparison to these boundaries that are
              not wetted.  The methodology to be utilized involves examination of grain
              orientation and grain boundary misorientation data (obtained by SEM and TEM)
              coupled with Rodrigues-Frank representations of the data.  This approach will
              develop characterization techniques that capture localized information in a
              statistically meaningful manner.  Wetting properties are of interest to Earth
              scientists because they affect grain boundary transport, a fundamental process
              by which bulk transport of chemical species through rocks containing static
              fluids occurs.  In addition, melt films along grain boundaries affect seismic
              velocities and attenuation within the solid Earth and rheological properties of
              materials in seismic zones.
