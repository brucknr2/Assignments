Abstract    :
              9422669  Sarat  This proposal supports a Summer Institute in 1995.  The
              institute is sponsored by the Law and Society Association.  Its theme is
              "Crossing Boundaries," and it focuses on introducing graduate students and 
              other new entrants to the varied strands of research and analysis in the law
              and society field.  It pays attention to the core debates and questions about
              boundary-crossing   that serve to integrate the field.  Publication of
              materials prepared for the institute will extend the impact of the effort. 
              Another important purpose of the seminar is to increase the cultural diversity
              of the field through the recruitment to the institute of scholars representing
              groups traditionally underrepresented in the law and society field.  %%%  This
              proposal supports a mentoring activity to assist in the develop of scientists
