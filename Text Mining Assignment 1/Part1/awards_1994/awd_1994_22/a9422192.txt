Abstract    :
              Abstract    9422192          Childress     Partial support is provided to the
              University of Florida to acquire  a SQUID magnetometer for the characterization
              of thin-film and  nanostructured magnetic and superconducting materials. The 
              equipment will have the sensitivity required to detect magnetic  signal from
              ultra-small magnetic structure in an applied magnetic  field range of + 5
              Tesla. In addition, it will be equipped with the  ability to perform AC
              susceptibility measurements, which are  critical to the accurate non-contact
              characterization of  superconducting phases, and useful for the study of
              relaxation  phenomena in nanostructured magnetic materials. Finally, it will be
               able to perform accurately at very low fields, so that magnetically  soft thin
              layers (useful for magneto-resistive sensor applications)  may be accurately
              characterized. An instrument of this kind is not  currently available at the
              University. An older instrument in the  Physics Department is being used
              continuously and does not include  AC measurement or ultra-low fields
              capabilities. The proposed  instrument will be used by a total of six faculty
              members and 20  graduate/undergraduate students.
