Abstract    :
              A group's ability to solve complex problems often depends on its members'
              ability to learn from each other.  We argue that scarcity makes learning
              difficult because it gives some people an incentive to withhold or misrepresent
              what they know and other people an incentive to discount or ignore what they
              hear.  Thus, even when a group's collective knowledge is sufficient to a solve
              a complex problem, scarcity may render its members unwilling or unable to
              transfer the knowledge that an effective solution requires.  Since both
              scarcity and complexity are present in most group decision making settings, we
              must develop knowledge of how groups adapt to simultaneous presence of both
              factors if we want to offer effective remedies for the regular problems they
              face.    We will develop such knowledge by drawing on lessons from both the
              cognitive and social sciences. We will design mathematical models and conduct
              laboratory experiments to examine not only how people learn from each other but
              also how, and whether groups can achieve complex goals in the presence of
              scarcity.  By identifying general conditions under which people can learn from
              each other, our research provides the foundation for concrete suggestions for
              how to improve the efficacy of group decision making.
