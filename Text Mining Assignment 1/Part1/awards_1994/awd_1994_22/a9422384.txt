Abstract    :
              This study focuses on the effects of participatory human resource management
              (HRM) practices on productivity and product quality for comparable American and
              Japanese production units.  It also examines the reasons why participatory HRM
              practices are or are not adopted in the United States and Japan.  The emphasis
              will be on the effects of systems of HRM practices, rather than individual
              practices, based on the hypothesis that HRM practices are likely to be
              complementary.  The study will use detailed data on comparable steel production
              lines owned by 23 different firms in the U.S. and Japan, with data collected
              through personal plant visits.  The data set will include measures of specific
              HRM practices used on specific steel production lines, measures of technology
              for each specific production line, and measures of production-level
              performance.  The study also will include analysis of activities workers
              actually perform on the job, as described in their _time diaries?, as a further
              means of understanding and interpreting the effects of HRM practices on work
              performance.  Longitudinal data will be gathered to track the  sustainability
              of HRM practices over time.  Companies participating in this study include NKK
              America and Nippon Steel USA.
