               Agroecological and Market Roles of Biologic Diversity in the Cacao
              Agroforestry Systems of Bahia, Brazil    This research will integrate
              environmental and market factors to examine the agroforestry systems in
              southeastern Bahia, Brazil which produce cacao exclusively for an international
              market.  The objective is to understand the rationale of the region's farmers
              to shade their cacao trees with either a dense, diverse canopy of native
              rainforest trees, known as cabrocagem, or to modernize with a thinner,
              homogeneous cover of imported trees and incorporate fertilizers and other
              technological inputs.  The research methodology will employ regional and
              farm-scale phases.  The regional-scale analysis will, for the first time,
              establish the cultivation patterns of the two farm types based on archive data
              and aerial photography held in Brazil's Center for Cacao Research near Itabuna,
              Bahia.  This analysis will examine natural environmental gradients in climate
              and soil type along with regional variation in credit and technology
              availability for their role in determining the type of cultivation.  The
              proposed dissertation research will contribute to the understanding of the
              interacting roles that factors of the natural environment, products markets,
              and individual farmer attitudes and goals play in shaping the level of
              biological diversity within an agroforestry system.  This is especially
              significant since the agricultural policy environment of many tropical
              countries favors development of market-oriented systems of agroforestry.
