Abstract    :
              9422386  Arnold    This project explores how 25 local newspapers covered 25
              members  of the House of Representatives between January 1, 1993, and  November
              8, 1994.  The project involves searching all editions of  the chosen newspapers
              for any articles, editorials, columns, or  letters that mention the selected
              representatives, coding the  7,500 to 8,000 items for their content, analyzing
              the coded data  with quantitative methods, and analyzing all individual items 
              with qualitative methods.    The project is designed to determine whether local
              newspapers  report the kinds of information that citizens would need to hold 
              representatives accountable for their actions in office.  The  basic assumption
              is that unbiased and readily\y available  information enhances the prospects
              for accountability, while  incomplete or biased information serves to thwart
              it.  The study  will explore the regularity with which local newspapers report 
              roll-call votes, the amount of information newspapers provide  about the issues
              under consideration and why representatives  voted as they did, the extent to
              which newspapers cover  representatives' other activities, including
              introducing bills,  holding hearings, and building coalitions, and the types of
               policy issues that attract journalists' attention.  The research  will also
              investigate whether newspapers recount representatives'  policy-related
              activities during subsequent electoral campaigns.  ***
