Abstract    :
              9422992  Green    This U.S.-Czech workshop on nondestructive characterization of
               materials will take place in Brno, in the Czech Republic, during  June 23-24,
              1995.  The organizers are Dr. Robert E. Green, Jr.,  of the Center for
              Nondestructive Evaluation at the Johns Hopkins  University and Dr. Ludek Ptacek
              of the Institute for Material  Engineering at the Technical University of Brno.
               At the workshop  experts in technologies of nondestructive methods will meet
              with  engineers and materials scientists to explore potential  applications of
              nondestructive characterization and discuss  solutions to problems encountered
              in industrial practice.      Properties of special interest to the participants
              are elastic  moduli, microstructure, residual stress, dislocation density, 
              porosity, fiber/matrix volume ration, and cure state.  Presented  papers will
              address the application of nondestructive techniques  for optimization of the
              processing and properties of polymers,  ceramics, and composites; the
              development of synthetically  structured materials; the measurement and
              characterization of  semiconductors and amorphous metals; and the growth of
              perfect  electronic and optical crystals and thin films.  These technical 
              presentations and resulting discussions are intended to foster  stronger links
              among the U.S. and Czech research communities with  the primary goal of
              identifying topics for future cooperative  research in the strategic areas
              mentioned.  ***
