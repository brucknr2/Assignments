Abstract    :
              9422459  Dure  The P.I. will examine the roles of several plant proteins in
              allowing plant cells to become desiccation tolerant/drought resistant.   These
              proteins accumulate to high levels in plant seeds and in water-stressed tissues
              of mature plants.  Genes for these proteins have been isolated and a continuous
              supply of these proteins in pure form is insured by their synthesis in and
              purification from transformed bacteria.  In particular, the possibility will be
              tested that these proteins promote cell survival in the water depleted state by
              electrostatically coating cell constituents (enzymes, membranes, etc.), thus
              mimicking the solvation role of water in the hydrated state.  Such a
              "solvation" may be necessary for cell constituents to be preserved in their
              biologically functional structure in the reduced water environment.  The
              efficacy of  these pure proteins, singly and in combination, in maintaining
              enzyme activity, membrane organization and organelle integrity during a round
              of dehydration-rehydration will be experimentally determined.  %%%  Plant seeds
              are subjected to severe dessication.  Other types of plant cells are also able
              to withstand severe and prolonged dessication.  In the early stages of drying
              out, seeds and other plant tissues produce proteins that allow plant cells to
              tolerate the extraordinary loss of cell water.  The P.I. has named these LEA
              proteins, for late embryogenesis abundant.  The objective of this project is to
              understand what these proteins do that allow plant cells to survive the loss of
              up to 90% of their water.  The function of these proteins has ramifications in
              the agricultural engineering of greater drought resistance in crop plants and
              in the food and dairy industry which seeks to improve the texture and
              nutritional qualities of preserved or dried products.
