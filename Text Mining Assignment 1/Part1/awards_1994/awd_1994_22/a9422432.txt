Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9422432  ROCKWELL  LEHIGH    The encounter of vortices with
              airfoils, blades and cylinders produces transient loading, flow-induced
              vibration, and noise generation.  Basic types of vortices include:  trailing
              (aircraft) vortices; microburst (wind shear) vortices; vortices from
              turbomachinery, wind turbine and helicopter blades; and vortices from heat
              exchanger tubes and raisers of ocean structures.  The aim of this investigation
              is to determine the generic features of vortex-body interactions, when there is
              a defined motion of the body relative to the arrival of the incident vortex. 
              Recently developed techniques of high-image-density particle image velocimetry
              will provide highly-resolved images of the instantaneous flow structure.  These
              images will be interpreted using theoretical concepts that allow classification
              of the key physics of the instantaneous flow patterns.  In turn, this knowledge
              of the flow patterns will provide insight into the loading on the body surface,
              which serves as the source of vibration of the body and noise radiation from
              it.  With this understanding of vortex-body encounters, it should be possible
              to formulate new types of control techniques or maneuver schedules that alter
              the physics of the vortex encounter and minimize undesirable loading.
