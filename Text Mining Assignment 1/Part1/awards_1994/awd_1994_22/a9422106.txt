Abstract    :
              9422106  Leahy     This award is to purchase equipment dedicated to research in
              computer and information science and engineering.  Specifically, the equipment
              will be used for research in multi-dimensional signal and image processing,
              including in particular: 1) fusion of multimodal neuroimaging data; 2) adaptive
              quantization of image and video; 3) automatic target recognition via deformable
              template matching; 4) design of high resolution diffractive optics for photonic
              interconnections and computing; and 5) advanced adaptive multidimensional and
              array signal processing.  Common to all of these projects is a need for access
              to fast numerical computation and high resolution visualization and display
              capabilities.  The goal of this project is to set up a state of the art
              facility for processing, visualization and display of multidimensional data. 
              Towards this end, a computer for high performance numerical computation, and a
              RAM-based workstation for display of high resolution video image sequences with
              a high performance graphics capability will be purchased.  ***
