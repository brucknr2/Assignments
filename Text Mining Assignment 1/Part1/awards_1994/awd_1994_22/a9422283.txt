Abstract    :
              9422283    A five-day workshop during the 1995 Linguistic Society of America 
              Summer Institute at the University of New Mexico will be devoted  to the
              investigation of issues in the interaction between  morphology and syntax in
              Athapaskan languages, some of which have  figured very large in current
              theoretical discussions in  linguistics. One day of the workshop will be set
              aside for  presentations and discussions on each of four topics, with a  fifth
              day for presentation and discussions which draw the topics  together. The
              themes for the first four days of the workshop are:  (1) third-person
              pronominal forms and their representations, (2)  the status of the dichotomy
              between inflection and derivation,  (3) clause structure, and (4)relations of
              morphology and syntax  with phonology. These topics address two major
              typological  questions for which Athapaskan languages have been vital sources 
              of data and hypotheses: the nature of syntactic  configurationality, and the
              necessity for 'position class'  morphology. Workshop participants will include
              scholars and  students of Athapaskan, many of whom will be assembled at the 
              Institute participating in the Athapaskan conference and in three  Institute
              courses on Athapaskan.
