Abstract    :
              9422180  Winter  The proposed research has the objectives of (1) organizing 
              macromolecules into highly ordered structures and (2)  studying the effects of
              flow and phase transitions on this  order.  For that purpose, we chose liquid
              crystalline  polymers because of their extended chain conformation and  their
              crystal like optical properties which allow direct  observation of the
              phenomena.  The experimental methods will  mostly be rheometry and polarizing
              microscopy (conoscopy).  %%%  The lack of understanding of the behavior during
              processing  has prevented the widespread use of engineering plastics  which
              have been synthesized in abundance in recent years.  Emphasis is on morphology
              development by physical processes  rather than chemical processes since the
              end-use properties  are as much determined by processing (which needs to be 
              advanced) as by the chemistry of the polymers.  The proposed  research will
              help to find processing strategies which  utilize phase transitions to organize
              polymers into novel  morphologies with superior properties.  ***
