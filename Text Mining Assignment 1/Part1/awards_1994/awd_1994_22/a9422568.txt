Abstract    :
              9422568  Tang       This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
              project develops a thickness monitoring and control technology for chemical
              mechanical polishing (CMP) of semiconductor thin films.  Phase I established a
              baseline capability in this new non-contact, real-time, in-situ monitoring
              technique.       Phase II further develops a practical system utilizing a
              dedicated monitoring region at a wafer center.  The approach is one of
              continuous interferometric monitoring of film thickness from back of the wafer.
               An industrial partner, R. Howard Strasbaugh, Inc. of   San Luis Obispo, CA, is
              supporting Phase II with in-kind services and use of facilities.    The
              technology is expected to find commercial application in CMP operations in the
              semiconductor industry. It can alleviate depth-of-focus problems and other
              problems encountered in multi-level metallization designs.
