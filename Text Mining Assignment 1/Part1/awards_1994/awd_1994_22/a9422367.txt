Abstract    :
              Quality oriented management practices have lacked a well grounded behavioral
              theory base for explaining and predicting variance in outcomes across different
              organizational contexts.  This research will test and refine a new theoretical
              framework that will enable tailoring of quality management practices contingent
              on organizational conditions, with the aim of enhancing the effectiveness of
              these practices.  The new theoretical framework suggests that there are two
              different types of quality management practices, one type that is suited very
              well for quality improvement of highly certain tasks, and the other is well
              suited to improvement of uncertain tasks.  This theory suggests that quality
              practices must match the task environment if they are to be effective.  The
              research will be use a multi disciplinary empirical methodology combining case
              studies with a large scale survey.  The case studies will challenge certain
              aspects of the new theory, while the survey will enable generalizability of the
              theory as modified following the case studies.  Two previously related studies
              have successfully pilot some of the proposed methods.  case study research will
              be conducted in firms that represent a range of sizes and industries, including
              Zerox, Motorola, Applied Materials, U. S Bureau of Mines, and smaller
              organizations belonging to the Hogan Quality Consortium.
