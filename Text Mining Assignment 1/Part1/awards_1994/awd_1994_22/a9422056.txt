Abstract    :
              The objective of this proposal is to better understand the physics  of the
              current sheet in the Earth's magnetotail.  The PIs will  clarify the role, as
              current carriers, of charged particles that do  not obey the guiding center
              approximations.  The study will  concentrate on the detailed modeling of
              mesoscale structures rather  than on an attempt to generate less exact models
              of the entire  tail.  A series of magnetic field models and corresponding model
               current sheets will also be developed.  Finally, a specific  magnetic field
              model will test the suggestion that variations in  ion orbit types in the tail
              can be important to the generation of  auroral field-aligned or Birkeland
              currents.  ***
