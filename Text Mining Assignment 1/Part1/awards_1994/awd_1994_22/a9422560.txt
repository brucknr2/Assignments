Abstract    :
                  This renewal grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the studies of
              Professor Weiss  at Georgetown University.  The research, which is aimed at
              developing new materials, focuses  on correlating the molecular structures of
              guest molecules with reaction dynamics in liquid  crystals, polymer films,
              gels, membranes, zeolites, and nanoscale cylinders.  The four focal  points of
              research are photochemical studies on 2-naphthyl acylates, dynamic emission
              studies  on crystalline 4-alkyl-N-(4-cyanophenyl)-piperidines, studies on ALS
              (Aromatics Linked to  Steroidal groups) gelators of organic liquids, and
              studies on polymerizations of columnar liquid  crystals for chiral separations.
                 In this materials-driven project, Dr. Weiss will study structures and
              reaction dynamics of guest  molecules in constrained, complex media such as
              liquid crystals, polymer films, gels,  membranes, zeolites, and nanoscale
              cylinders.  This multi-faceted research employs  photochemical, calorimetric,
              spectroscopic, and polymeric techniques to unravel factors that  influence
              their molecular structures and reactivities.  A better understanding of the
              factors  controlling transformations in these organized molecular assemblies
              will result from this research  that is expected to lead to new materials with
              specific diagnostic applications.
