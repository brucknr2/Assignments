Abstract    :
                Some apes (especially gibbons), and perhaps some ancestors to humans, used
              special forms of arm-swinging to move among the tree branches.  Brachiation is
              the term given to the most specialized form of such suspensory behavior.  In
              attempting to understand the mechanics of brachiation, it has been modeled as
              the movement of a passive pendulum.  However, this likely does not accurately
              represent the actual mechanisms by which gibbons, for example, move through the
              complex and obstacle-ridden world of tree branches.  There be active propulsive
              forces to modulate speed and direction.    This research project will identify
              the muscular mechanisms the gibbon can use to maneuver and propel itself, and
              what strategies other than pendular motion exist for minimizing energy
              expenditure in brachiation.  To date, research in this area has been limited by
              the lack of a method for directly measuring the kinetic reaction forces
              produced by an animal subject during locomotion.  In this study, a newly
              developed 6-component force/torque transducer will be attached to a handhold
              used by brachiating animals.  Combined with simultaneous video analysis,iti
              will be used for a comprehensive study of the mechanics of brachiation.
