Abstract    :
              This research is on synthesis and verification of digital systems.   The
              computational basis for the work is the binary decision diagram  (BDD) data
              structure and extensions.  In low power circuit design,  new ideas in BDD
              technology are being used for synthesis  algorithms, and to estimate power
              consumption via probablistic  behavior of circuits.  Decomposition concepts,
              such as tearing, to  assess properties of very large circuits are being
              investigated.   In verification, approximate exploration ideas are being
              examined  for use in checking equivalence of very large circuits.  
              Hierarchical verification capabilities, where parts of the circuit  are modeled
              at the bit level and other parts at the word level, are  being examined.  To
              provide a sound connection between high level  synthesis and high level
              verification, as well as to validate high  level VHDL descriptions, refined
              comparisons of non-deterministic  systems, such as bi-simulation equivalence
              and testing equivalence  and pre-orders are being explored.
