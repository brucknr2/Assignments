Abstract    :
              9422794  Kole  Once predominately white and male, the American Labor force is 
              composed increasingly of women, minorities, and foreign-born  workers.  Given
              the changing face of America's workforce, the  objective of this project is to
              better understand how a divers  workforce affects the activities of the firm. 
              Specifically, a  theoretical framework is developed to capture the impact of 
              worker heterogeneity on organizations, and its testable  implications are
              explored.  The spirit of this research is that  workforce diversity impacts
              organizations both within their  boundaries and in the interface with
              customers.  In both of these  of settings, information is exchanged and
              miscommunications are  assumed to lower the efficiency of the firm.  This
              assumption of  lower communication costs between similar-type agents formalizes
               worker heterogeneity as a form of human capital and facilitates  the matching
              of a firm's distribution and customer populations to  minimize delivery costs.
