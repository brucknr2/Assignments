Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9422458  Mark Davis    A workshop is organized and conducted to
              define standard reference materials and properties for zeolites.  A formal
              proposal to the National Institute of Standards and Technology for
              establishment of these standards is prepared.    Zeolites are widely used for
              several important industrial processes.  They serve as detergents, separation
              agents, and catalysts.  However, widely accepted standards are lacking, making
              definition of quality difficult.
