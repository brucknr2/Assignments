Abstract    :
              9422138  Dorr     This award is to purchase equipment (cost-shared with The
              Institute for Advanced Computer Studies (UMIACS) and Department of Linguistics
              at the University of Maryland) dedicated to support specific projects in the
              laboratory for Computational Linguistics and Information Processing (CLIP). 
              These projects are in the areas of information mediation, language translation
              and tutoring, and text filtering and retrieval.  The software requirements
              include large dictionaries, corpora, data models and databases, high-level
              database query languages, and a Prolog interpreter.  Since many of these
              resources are available only on CD ROMs, the hardware requirements include an
              optical disk controller and large disks for storage.  Also there is a need for
              two workstations with significant computing power for indexing and processing
              of text and installation of an object server.  Finally, four Xterminals for
              extensive prototype development and an eye-tracker for testing hypotheses
              related to the development of psycholinguistically-grounded NLP models are
              needed.  ***
