Abstract    :
              9422092  Medhi     This award is to purchase multi-processor computer equipment
              which will be dedicated to support research in Computer Science
              Telecommunications Program at the University of Missouri-Kansas City.  The
              equipment will be used for several research projects, including in particular:
              "Routing and Design of Wide-Area Broadband Networks," "Call Admission for Video
              Traffic in High Speed Networking," "High Speed Integrated ATM Networking,"
              "Self-Routing and Network Embedding Problems in Parallel Processing," and
              "Evaluation of the Signaling System No. 7 Protocol for Emerging Services".  To
              conduct these research projects, the hardware platform will be used for solving
              large-scale network optimization problems, for doing extensive simulation of
              networks and  network protocols, for doing statistical analysis of traffic
              data, and for solving computing intensive problems in parallel processing.  The
              multi-processor computers with large memories provide a flexible computing
              environment by making efficient use of resources and making it possible to
              solve large models in a timely manner, thus resulting in effective research.
