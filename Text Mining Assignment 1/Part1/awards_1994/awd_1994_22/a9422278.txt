Abstract    :
              9422278  Powell    Bargaining is ubiquitous. But the settings in which it takes 
              place vary immensely, and these different settings shape the  questions
              researchers ask about bargaining. Economists, for  example, have generally
              focused on situations of voluntary  exchange. A seller, for instance, cannot
              compel a buyer to pay  more than the buyer believes the object for sale is
              worth; the  seller and buyer must agree on a price. This focus on voluntary 
              exchange leads naturally to a set of questions and concerns that  have received
              an enormous amount of attention since Rubinstein's  (1982) seminal paper
              renewed interest in noncooperative  bargaining theory: Does bargaining lead to
              Pareto eflicient  outcomes? Under what circumstances does Coase's theorem hold?
               What accounts for delay in reaching agreement?    This project will use
              game-theoretic models of bargaining to  examine the effects of the shadow of
              power on bargaining.  Preliminary work has developed one model and employed it
              to study  the relation between stability and the distribution of power in  the
              context of international relations theory. The distribution  of power is fixed
              in the that model. With support from the NSF,  the model will be extended by
              letting the distribution of power  vary over time. The work will investigate,
              first, how a  time-varying distribution of power influences the timing and 
              terms of agreements and, second, the factors affecting the  "stickiness" of
              institutions and agreements. This study should  advance and deepen our
              understanding of important questions in  not only international relations but
              in political science more  generally.  ***
