Abstract    :
              Malathy Venkataraman of The College of William and Mary is supported by   the
              Experimental Physical Chemistry Program and the India/South Asia   Program to
              perform high resolution infrared spectroscopic studies of   molecules
              contributing to the greenhouse effect and ozone depletion.    This project is a
              collaborative effort between Dr. Venkataraman and Dr.   D'Cunha of the Bhabha
              Atomic Research Center (B.A.R.C.), Bombay, India.    Infrared spectra of
              carbonyl fluoride and halon-1301 will be taken using   the high-resolution
              Fourier transform spectrometer at the National   Institute of Standards and
              Technology, and analyzed using computer   programs developed at B.A. R. C.  
              Low temperature diode laser absorption   spectra of halon-1301 will be taken at
              the NASA Langley Research Center   in order to obtain more complete information
              on its molecular parameters.    This spectroscopic data will be valuable in
              pollution monitoring and   identification of spectral signatures in upper
              atmospheric research.  Chlorofluorocarbons, such as freons and halons, are
              known to be   responsible for much of the ozone depletion problem.  The
              atmospheric   concentrations of these molecules are currently estimated from
              product   analysis.  This research will provide information which can be used
              to   directly monitor the concentrations of these pollutants in the  
              atmosphere.
