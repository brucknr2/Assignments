Abstract    :
              9422123  Volz     This award is to purchase equipment to support research in
              distributed real and virtual environments, including: 1) Attentive Model for
              Video Telecommunication -- A framework for video analysis utilizing visual
              attention theory and eye movements is expected to yield high compression
              ratios; 2) Attention-Based Graphical Display of Complex Virtual Environments --
              An attentive display-time compression strategy will be developed, which tracks
              the viewer's eyes and matches the imagery to the perceptual limitations of the
              human visual system; 3) Intelligent Control in a Telerobotic Network Using
              Predictive Simulated Reality -- To counteract problems over long distances,
              predictive simulation and intelligent control are planned, in which the
              operator enters a virtual world corresponding to the real world; 4) Developing
              a General Framework for Natural and Precise Gestural Manipulations -- A logical
              hand device to support precise and natural hand manipulations in virtual
              environments, e.g., a general framework to compose and manipulate 3-dimensional
              widgets and a sub-gesture alphabet to tokenize American Sign Language are
              presently being developed; 5) Rehabilatory Head Mounted Display Applications
              for the Physically Challenged -- Virtual Reality technology are used to aide in
              the diagnosis and monitoring of subjects participating in physical
              rehabilitation and training programs, through the use of body tracking devices
              and Augmented Reality displays.  ***
