Abstract    :
              9422594  Milikh    The objective of the proposal is to provide the computational
              and  physics framework required for a quantitative understanding of the 
              puzzling phenomenon of high altitude optical flashes generated  above giant
              thunderstorms, and their potential correlations with  observed gamma-ray and
              radio emissions.  Key physics ingredients of  the model include utilization of
              the electric field of the upward  propagating electromagnetic pulse due to
              cloud-to-cloud,  predominantly horizontal, discharges, in conjunction with the 
              physics of runaway phenomena due to the presence of cosmic ray  secondaries.
              Preliminary estimates indicate the variability of such  a model and its
              agreement with key observational features.  The  development of a comprehensive
              code that will model quantitatively  high altitude lightning and its potential
              association with radio  and gamma-ray emissions is proposed.  The proposed
              research is  relevant to the development of a mechanism responsible for 
              direction transient electric coupling between the ionosphere and  the
              stratosphere, and can thus have implications for the global  electric circuit
              of the earth.  ***
