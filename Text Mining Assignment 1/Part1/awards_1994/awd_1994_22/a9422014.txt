Abstract    :
              9422014  Koditschek    The University of Michigan has received an award to
              purchase real-time control and visual sensing hardware, to support research in
              five robotics projects in the Departments of Electrical Engineering and
              Computer Science. The research projects include parallel vibratory parts
              orientation, rigid body manipulations, dynamical acquisition of multiple
              objects, gestural input recognition systems for remote robot guidance and
              remote teleoperation, and dynamically interpreted gestural control.  ***
