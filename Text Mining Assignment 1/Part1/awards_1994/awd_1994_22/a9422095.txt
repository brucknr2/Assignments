Abstract    :
              9422095  Dutt     This award is to purchase equipment for investigating
              methodologies for the concurrent design of embedded electronic systems
              involving both hardware and software, where teams of designers concurrently
              refine the initial product specifications into working prototypes.  The
              research will adapt, evaluate and extend novel methodologies used in the
              traditionally distinct domains of hardware and software, and will attempt to
              quantify metrics for design cycle reduction, provide concurrent design process
              feedback and tune the design methodologies based on the domain of the
              application.  Another important goal of the research is to investigate new
              paradigms for technology transfer between universities and industry with the
              objective of increasing the long-term impact of the technology transferred. 
              Specifically, the research will 1) evaluate the proposed methodologies on
              realistic design examples provided by the industry, 2) increase
              university-industry interaction through on-site industrial visitors working
              closely with university researchers to test the proposed methodologies, and 3)
              facilitate better communication between university researchers and industrial
              partners through the use of multimedia platforms.  ***
