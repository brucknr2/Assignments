Abstract    :
              9422583  Spilhaus  The International Permafrost Association (IPA) of the
              International  Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) will provide coordination
              and  communications for international scientific programs related to 
              permafrost.  The IPA, through working groups; special projects; and 
              conferences and workshops will address issues such as global change  and
              permafrost; periglacial processes and environments; cryosols;  mountain
              permafrost; foundation engineering in permafrost environ-  ments; seasonal
              freezing and thawing of permafrost; permafrost at  high latitudes and in rugged
              topography; and international exchange  of data and information.  The IPA
              Secretariat ensures planning, de-  velopment, and implementation of these
              activities, working under  the direction of the IPA Council.  The Secretariat
              plans and orga-  nizes meetings of the Council, its Executive Committee, and
              working  groups; and prepares and distributes working documents for and re- 
              ports of IPA meetings, as well as other IPA documents and reports,  draft
              scientific papers and a regular newsletter.  ***
