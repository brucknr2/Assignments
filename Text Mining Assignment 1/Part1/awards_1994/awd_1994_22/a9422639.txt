Abstract    :
              9422639  Kreps  The  archives  of  the  Disaster Research Center,  University 
              of  Delaware contain approximately 3,000 transcribed and 5,000-6,000 
              untranscribed  tape-recorded interviews that have been  conducted  in  field 
              studies since 1963.  Using a portion of this material,  the  investigators have
              developed a theory of organizing and role  enactment  during the emergency
              periods of disaster.   Continuing  work on the remaining thousands of interview
              in the archives will  be  completed  during the three-year period of this 
              grant.   The  objectives  of  this  phase of the research are  to  refine  core
               dimensions of the theory, expand its generalizabilty, and provide  additional 
              empirical  grounding  for  principles  of   emergency  management.   Both 
              graduate  and  undergraduate  students   will  participate  in this endeavor,
              with support for the latter  being  provided   under   the  Research 
              Experience  for  Undergraduates  Program.  ***
