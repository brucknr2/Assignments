Abstract    :
              9422338  Mehregany  A rapid thermal chemical vapor deposition (RTCVD) system
              will be purchased for MEMS Processing.  RTCVD provides higher deposition rates
              for polysilicon, silicon dioxide and silicon nitride in comparison with low
              pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD).  As a result this proposal 
              requests $50,000 in equipment funds to construct a rapid thermal chemical vapor
              deposition (RTCVC) system for MEMS processing.  RTCVD provides higher
              deposition rates for polysilicon, silicon dioxide, and silicon nitride in
              comparison with low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD).  As a result,
              single-wafer processing and deposition of thicker films become two important
              practical features of RTCVD.  Both of these features are valuable for MEMS
              processing.  The former enables rapid prototyping of ideas and the latter
              provides for enhanced device design flexibility.  Additionally, the low thermal
              budget associated with RTCVD enables development of integrated MEMS processes
              in which micromachining is carried out on wafers with electronics, fabricated
              prior to or mixed in with the micromachining steps.  ***
