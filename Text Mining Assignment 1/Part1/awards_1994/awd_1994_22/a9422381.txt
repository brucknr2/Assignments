Abstract    :
              9422381  Skjellum  Distributed-memory  computers have been available for about a
              decade.  Still, hard questions remain concerning the scalability of implicit
              numerical methods, and new, alternative numerical methods, in order to gauge
              the value of further, large-scale investment in parallelization of key
              applications. Furthermore, algorithms, even if developed to be suitably
              scalable for certain applications, must be represented in software
              cost-effectively in order to make the massively parallel systems economical
              overall.  Therefore, we seek to answer fundamental questions about algorithms
              and software technology related to implicit numerical integration methods, and
              more generally, about trade-offs between concurrency and convergence of
              iterative methods.
