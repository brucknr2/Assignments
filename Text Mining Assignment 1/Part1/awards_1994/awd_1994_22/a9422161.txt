Abstract    :
              9422161  Kavazanjian  Federal regulations required that municipal solid waste 
              landfills located in seismic impact zones be designed to  resist earthquake
              hazards.   The seismic response of waste  repositories is of concern because
              dynamic loads may produce  relative movements within the waste, liner and cover
               systems, foundation and their interfaces.  These movements  could damage the
              liner systems, with a consequent loss of  sealing, and/or disrupt the function
              of the leachate and gas  collection systems.    There is a relative lack of
              field data regarding landfill  performance during earthquake shaking,
              particularly with  respect to seismic performance of waste fills constructed 
              with composite liner systems containing geosynthetics.  The  1994 Northridge
              Earthquake provides important observational  data on the response of landfills
              to strong levels of  earthquake shaking.  Landfills which experienced strong 
              levels of shaking (peak bedrock accelerations of 0.2 g to  over 0.5g),
              including two with geosynthetic liner systems,  were inspected by the research
              team immediately after the  event.  None of these landfills showed any signs of
              major  instability, but several experienced damage due to cracking.    Because
              of the difficulties associated with laboratory  evaluation of the dynamic
              properties of waster materials,  these field observations present an invaluable
              opportunity  to back-calculate dynamic strength and deformation  properties. 
              One of the landfills (OII) is well instrumented  with survey monuments,
              inclinometers and a pair of strong  motion recording stations.    The
              objectives of the project are to:    1. Gather observational data documenting
              the seismic    performance of solid waste landfills strongly shaken by    the
              1994 Northridge earthquake.      2. Organize existing landfill characterization
              data,    including characterization of the waste fill properties   
              (composition, age, unit weight, moisture content,    strength, and shear wave
              velocity) and landfill geometry.       3. Perform preliminary one-dimensional
              (1-D) equivalent    linear and nonlinear dynamic response analyses of five   
              important landfill case records and 2-D equivalent linear    dynamic response
              analyses of the OII landfill.  Perform    pseudo-static limit equilibrium and
              Newmark-type seismic    deformation analyses to back-calculate minimum dynamic 
                strength values and to calibrate prevalent seismic design    procedures.  ***
