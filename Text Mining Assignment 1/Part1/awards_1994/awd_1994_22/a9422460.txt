              MCB-9422460  The XIIIth International Conference on Glycoconjugates will be
              held in Seattle, Washington, August 20-26, 1995.  The Symposium which is
              sponsored by the International Glycoconjugate Organization is the major
              international meeting of scientists in glycoconjugate research.   In order for
              junior scientists to attend and to present their data and to have further
              excvhange on the international level it is necessary to obtain travel funds for
              them.   Therefore the Society for Glycobiology is requesting travel funds for
              junior scientiqts.  The mechanism of selecting awardees  will be on a
              competitive scientific basis.   %%% In the past few years much research has
              provided evidence that the carbohydrate chains on proteins play an important
              function in the diverse properties of those proteins.  This conference will
              report on studies carried out at many sites around the world on the basic
              processes whereby these carbohydrate chains are assembled and how they
              function. ***                         ;                                  Oh
