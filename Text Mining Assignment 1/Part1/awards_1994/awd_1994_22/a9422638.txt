Abstract    :
                The Great Depression was one of the pivotal episodes in American  history. 
              Because its repercussions continue to affect the  thinking of both economists
              and policy makers, it is important to  develop a comprehensive understanding of
              how economic policies  influenced the crash and the subsequent recovery.  The
              purpose of  this project is to analyze three key aspects of the depression. 
              The first will examine how the fear of bank panics and currency  devaluation
              during the early l930s may have led to the hoarding  of gold, and how this
              hoarding could have resulted in deflation.  The second aspect will examine the
              impact of both European  currency crises and U.S. monetary policy on the latter
              stages of  the depression.  The third will examine the impact of New Deal 
              labor legislation such as the minimum wage.  The common thread  tying these
              three aspects together will be the use of financial  markets.  By examining the
              immediate impact of these policies on  stock, bond, and commodities markets, it
              will be possible to draw  important inferences regarding the effects on the
              overall  economy.  ***
