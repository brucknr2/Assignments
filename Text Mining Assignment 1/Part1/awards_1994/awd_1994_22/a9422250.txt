Abstract    :
              9422250  Coyle     This award is to establish a testbed for `oth experimentation
              with and modeling and analysis of traffic on high-speed, heterogeneous, local
              area networks.  The equipment purchased for the testbed includes three ATM
              switches, one of which provides access to other types of networks, and a
              high-performance workstation with extensive video capability.     The following
              equipment will be connected to the testbed: 17 high-performance workstations
              located in various laboratories and research groups; two servers of, and the
              Ethernet backbone for the Engineering Computer Network (ECN), which supports
              over 12,000 users; and, at least two T1 lines  provided by GTE for access to
              local hospitals and high schools.  The testbed will have access to the Internet
              through the ECN.  These connections will allow network traffic from many
              different applications to be brought into the testbed for study.     The
              research this testbed will support includes: Modeling and analysis of network
              traffic statistics and network control algorithms; Communication network design
              and analysis; Discrete event system  simulations driven by empirical data;
              Video and image compression algorithms for ATM networks; Distributed simulation
              and visualization for  manufacturing and the teleoperation of robots.  ***
