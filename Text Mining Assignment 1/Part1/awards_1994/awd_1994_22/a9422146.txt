Abstract    :
              9422146  Huttenlocher     This award is to purchase equipment for support of
              research in Computer and Information Science and Engineering.  Specifically,
              this award will be used for equipment to support several projects in the
              processing and analysis of digital video: 1) video motion analysis for
              annotation and browsing -- detecting significant changes in camera motion and
              tracking moving objects in order to automatically segment unstructured video;
              2) adaptive video compression -- using motion segmentation in compression; 3)
              video transcoding; 4) network protocols for continuous media; and 5)
              compression-- tolerant image analysis -- including development of algorithms
              that operate directly on compressed video data.  ***
