Abstract    :
              9422323  Sillman     In recent years, results from two-dimensional global
              simulations have demonstrated that gas-phase hydrocarbon chemistry and aqueous
              chemistry both have significant impacts in the troposphere, particularly with
              regard to the important tropospheric species ozone, NOx, and hydroxyl radical. 
              A complete analysis of these photochemical impacts requires a three-dimensional
              simulation.  Recently three-dimensional chemical tracer models (CTMs) have been
              applied to photochemically active tropospheric species, however, the
              application of CTMs has been limited by computational constraints associated
              with the calculation of photochemical production and loss.     The PI has
              developed an innovative numerical approach to solving the equations of
              tropospheric chemistry.  This method uses special properties of tropospheric
              odd hydroeen to obtain a convergent implicit solution to the equations of
              photochemical production and loss.  By utilizing specific photochemical
              properties of the troposphere as part of the solution, the method is
              computationally very fast.     In this project, the existing capabilities will
              be extended in two directions.  First, techniques will be developed to include
              aqueous photochemistry as part of the numerical code.  Second, an analysis of
              the cycle of tropospheric reactive nitrogen in three-dimensional global models
              with gas-and aqueous-phase chemistry will be completed.  This analysis will
              lead to direct comparisons between simulated reactive nitrogen species and
              recent measurements associated with the North Atlantic Regional Experiment.
