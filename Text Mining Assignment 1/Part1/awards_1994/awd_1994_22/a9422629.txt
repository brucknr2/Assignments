Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  Zhang & Faghri  University of Rhode Island  CTS-9422629    Experiments
              and computer simulations will be conducted to study the effects of vibration on
              phase change and sedimentation.  Of particular interest is determining if the
              heat transfer rate can be enhanced or diminished under a wide range of physical
              parameters and by the selection and control of the Vibration frequencies and
              amplitude.  Three types of materials will be investigated:  Those having a
              solid/liquid density ratio less than, equal to and greater than one.  If the
              heat transfer rate can be modified by vibration, potential applications exist
              in, for example, materials processing, metallurgy, crystal growth, and casting.
