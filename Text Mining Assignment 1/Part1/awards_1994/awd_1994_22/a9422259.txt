Abstract    :
              9422259  Mitra  The   Superconductivity Information Center (SIC)  was 
              established  at  Iowa  State  University  in 1987.  The Center responds  to 
              individual  inquiries  in the field of superconductivity, sends news flashes, 
              and  publishes   a   bi-monthly  newsletter,  High-Tc  Update,   which   is 
              distributed internationally, without charge, as hard copy,  electronic  mail, 
              and  downloadable  files.  The Center  has  approximately  2500  subscribers 
              of  which  2000 are in the USA.  The  Center  serves  the  scientific community
              by providing rapid, timely, and informal research  results concerning
              superconductivity.  %%%  The Superconductivity Information Center (SIC) was
