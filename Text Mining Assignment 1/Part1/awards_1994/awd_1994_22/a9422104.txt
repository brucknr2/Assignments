Abstract    :
              Under this award, Dr. Bromwich will systematically evaluate the  ability of
              National Meteorological Center's (NMC) Medium Range  Forecast (MRF) model to
              simulate the atmosphere in high southern  latitudes and, based on that
              analysis, consider improvements to the  model's boundary layer.  This project
              represents a component of an  international effort both to evaluate numerical
              weather prediction  and to obtain a more detailed understanding of the
              meteorology of  the region.  The study will make use of the unprecedented
              quantity  of data that will be acquired near Antarctica during the First 
              Regional Observing Study of the Troposphere (FROST).  The MRF's  regional
              performance and biases will be compared to analyses of the  FROST data.  The
              evaluation will focus on precipitation processes  and boundary layer structure.
               In addition, a series of sensitivity  studies will be conducted with the MRF
              to evaluate the impact of  the Antarctic observations and to test boundary
              layer  parameterizations.    This project will be conducted in collaboration
              with NMC staff as  part of the NSF/NMC Joint Program in Numerical Weather
              Prediction.   Improved forecast in this region would be of major benefit to 
              operations in this region.  The NSF support will be shared by the  Polar Ocean
              and Meteorology Program.
