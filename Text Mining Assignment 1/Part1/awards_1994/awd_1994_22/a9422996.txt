Abstract    :
              This project involves the dissertation research of a student of cultural
              anthropology from the University of Chicago.  The project involves the
              ethnographic study of local peasant Indian labor leaders in highland Bolivia.  
              Taking the highland town of Quillacollo as a representative center of peasant
              political activity, the project will study the main regional peasant union,
              using participant-observation of union meetings and other public activities;
              recording the history of local disputes and their resolution; extensive
              interviews with leaders and their familes, including recording the personal
              political networks and political biographies of leaders, as well as a survey of
              patterns of livelihood.  The research will assess whether peasant unions
              continue to provide a sense of shared community and function as instruments for
              collective action in the socially atomized context of the community.  This
              research is important because it will add to the corps of specialists
              knowledgeable about the Andean region of South America, and advance our
              understanding of the evolution of unionism and of the community role of peasant
              unions.  Increased understanding of the role of peasant-worker groups with
              respect to their community and the function of their leaders is important to
              help us understand the behavior of such groups in contemporary society.   This
              case study will provide a valuable addition to our knowledge which can help us
              understand similar situations in other developing countries.
