Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9422442  Donnelly  University of Oregon    This work of a careful
              quantitative study of the evolution and dynamics of vortices in rotating
              channel flow, including, transition to turbulence, which simulations suggest
              involves a sequence of time-dependent states of traveling waves of both long
              (wavy vortices) and short (twisting vortices) wavelength.  There has been
              considerable activity in numerical modeling of the transition process and it is
              critical to obtain detailed quantitative information from experiments in this
              process.  This work can impact upon our understanding of modeling flows
              undergoing transition.  The long range applications of such work involves
              understanding heat transfer is rotating systems such as turbine blades and
              impellers of centrifugal pumps.
