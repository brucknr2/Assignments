Abstract    :
              Houk  9422318    This project involves systematic two-dimensional spectral
              classification of nearly a quarter-  million stars from Harvard's Henry Draper
              Catalogue, using high-quality spectroscopia plates  taken with the Michigan
              Curtis Schmidt telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American  Observatory in Chile
              and the Burrell Schmidt at Kitt Peak National Observatory near Tucson  AZ. 
              Working northward from the south celestial pole, so far over 155,000 stars have
              been  classified and their spectral types published.  From these, good
              temperatures, absolute  brightnesses and distances can be obtained for the
              stars.  Chemical peculiarities and binarity  are also detected from many of
              them.  This 5-year grant will support the classification of  stars for Volume 6
              of the Michigan Spectral Catalogue, covering declinations from +5 to  +30
              degrees, and the start of classification of Volume 7 stars, +35 to +90 degrees,
              the last  installment of the project.  ***
