Abstract    :
              9422007  Beveridge     This award is to purchase two shared-memory
              multiprocessor systems, one with accelerated 3D graphics as required by the
              following research projects: 1)  Computer Vision and Graphics; 2) 
              Combinatorial Optimization Using Local and Global Search; 3)  Machine Learning
              for Classification and Control; 4)  Planning Agents in Dynamic Simulated
              Environments; 5)  Comparing Functional Programming Languages.     Essential to
              these projeats is the computational power of the multiprocessors.  The
              equipment will provide a means to gain experience mapping algorithms onto
              coarse grain parallel hardware.  Many parallel algorithms in these projects
              require a shared memory multiprocessor architecture.  The vision, graphics,
              learning and planning projects explicitly benefit from the 3D graphics
              capability of the hardware.  In addition to the above projects, this equipment
              will be available for exploration of new areas of research.  ***
