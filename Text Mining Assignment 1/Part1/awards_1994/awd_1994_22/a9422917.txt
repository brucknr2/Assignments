Abstract    :
              This agreement is in support  of the National Forum on  "Meeting the Challenge:
              Health, Safety and Food for  America".  Several agencies will be contributing
              toward this  Forum that is scheduled for November 21-22, 1994.    The Committee
              on Health, Safety, and Food will host a forum  as part of the effort to develop
              implementation plans for FY  1996 Research and Development policies, including
              goals and  priorities, developed through the National Science and 
              Technological Council (NSTC).  The aim of the forum is to  obtain expert advice
              from academia, industry and others in  the private sector.  It is planned to
              invite 200-300 guests  to participate in the two-day discussion to be held at
              the  headquarters of the National Academy of  Sciences.    A series of papers
              will be prepared for discussion by forum  participants.  Six of the
              Subcommittees working under the  aegis of the Committee on Health, Safety and
              Food are  developing white papers.  Participants will be sent a list  of topics
              and as a condition of participation will be  required to submit a 2-page paper
              on any one of the  subjects.
