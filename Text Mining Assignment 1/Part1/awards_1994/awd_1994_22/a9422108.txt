Abstract    :
              9422108  Shaw   Defects on the surface of a number of extruded polymer melts,
              thought to be caused by the rheology of the melt as it solidifies, are often
              identified by the descriptive term "sharkskin" defects.  Empirically, it is
              known that this surface defect can be eliminated at lower extrusion rates,
              because this reduces the stresses that are assumed to be the cause of
              sharkskinning.  These investigators propose an analytical and experimental
              program to identify and understand the mechanisms to control sharkskin
              formation.  With this understanding, they should be able to eliminate sharkskin
              or design a specific sharkskin surface texture.  Along with a number of
              analytical tests, they will use a light scattering device in an extrusion die
              to measure the rheological properties of the extruded polymer experimentally. 
              This, along with a modeling and computional program will determine the
              mechanics of the flow, incorporating various rheological models, to predict
              pressure and output fluctuations that can be correlated with the development of
              sharkskin.     The impact of this research will be a better understanding of
              sharkskinning, a phenomenon that today is unpredictable, and its elimination
              usually requires lower extrusion speeds and reduced productivity.  ***
