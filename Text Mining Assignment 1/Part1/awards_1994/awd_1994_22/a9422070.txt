Abstract    :
                    ABSTRACT  OPP-9422070  HUNTINGTON      This research project will document
              traditional ecological wisdom of beluga whales in native villages in NW Alaska,
              and in Chukotka, Russia. The objectives are to gather information on the
              natural history of beluga whales, including aspects of human use and
              interaction. A primary focus will be to examine patterns and changes over time,
              providing a temporal depth that is unavailable in the scientific literature.
              While traditional knowledge is often discussed, little research of this kind
              has been done in Alaska and Chukotka. This is also a pilot project of the
              Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy and is intended to demonstrate how
              indigenous knowledge can be documented and incorporated into this and other
              management and conservation programs.        ??
