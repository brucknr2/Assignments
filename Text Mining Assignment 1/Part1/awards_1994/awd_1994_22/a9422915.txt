Abstract    :
              99422915  Land   This award provides partial funding for the support of a
              laboratory technician to oversee the operation and maintenance of the
              solid-source thermal ionization mass spectrometry laboratory in the Department
              of Geological Sciences at the University of Texas, Austin. The institution is
              committed to providing the remaining funds required. The technician will be
              responsible for assisting users, especially students, in obtaining high quality
              data, and in enhancing the capabilities of the mass spectrometer through
              software development, hardware testing and calibration. The thermal ionization
              mass spectrometer laboratory is engaged in research and teaching projects of
              several faculty members requiring the determination of high-precision isotopic
              compositions of boron, strontium, neodymium, lead, rubidium, and thorium as
              well as the determination of the trace abundances of rare-earth elements by
              isotope dilution techniques.   ***
