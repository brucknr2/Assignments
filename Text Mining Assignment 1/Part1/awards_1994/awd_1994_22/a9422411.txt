Abstract    :
              9422411  Croteau    This award will provide a research fellowship for Keith
              Croteau  to spend a year at the International Center for Antarctic  Information
              and Research (ICAIR) located in Christchurch,  New Zealand. While at ICAIR, Mr.
              Croteau will be working under  Dr. Steven M. Smith, the Director of the Center,
              which is  primarily concerned with assembling, processing and supplying 
              research and general information relating to Antarctica and its  environs.   
              During the past few decades, the Ross Sea Region of Antarctica  has witnessed
              increased utilization by both the scientific and  non-scientific communities.
              In order to minimize negative impacts  to the region, ICAIR is developing a
              management plan for Ross  Island. Integral to the design of this plan is the
              use of remote  sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) technologies. 
              Specific objectives to be addressed by Croteau are to identify  and evaluate
              available data for the Ross Sea region,  to develop a GIS database for this
              area, and to conduct  preliminary GIS analyses relevant to the development of a
               management plan for Ross Island. The benefits of this project  extend beyond
              the cooperating countries of New Zealand and the  U.S.  An effective management
              plan will assist in coordinating  the activities of all nations utilizing the
              Ross Island region.      A well designed digital database will help facilitate
              the  exchange of information concerning the Ross Sea region and  perhaps may
              also set a precedent for the entire Antarctic region.  The travel is supported
              under the U.S.-New Zealand Junior  Investigator Research Fellowship activity.
