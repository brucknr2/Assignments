Abstract    :
              This project examines the structure of 12 major industries in post-war Japan. 
              It will refine measures of rents (returns) and external economies (spillovers)
              that are critical to the debates in the academic and development policy
              communities over the appropriateness of government support for strategic
              industrial sectors.  In order for other countries to emulate the Japanese trade
              and industrial policies, it is critical to determine what criteria are used to
              choose among strategic investment options.  Data for 1955 through 1990 will be
              collected from the Japan Input-Output Tables maintained by the Administrative
              Management Agency as well as from the Kogyo Tokei Chosa (Census of
              Manufacturing).
