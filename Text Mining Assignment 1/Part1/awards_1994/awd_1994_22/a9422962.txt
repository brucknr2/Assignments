Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9422962    It is proposed to experimentally investigate
              supermicron particle aggregation and sedimentation in relatively idealized
              conditions, in order to better understand the basic  physical processes and
              provide a data base for modeling.  The specific objectives are to conduct flow
              visualization in a laboratory system, analyze and model the fundamental
              parameters controlling gravity induced aggregation, and characterize retarded
              coagulation and subsequent aggregate morphology in quiescent environmental
              systems.  The proposed quiescent reactor apparatus allows for real time
              observation of gravity-driven aggregation dynamics, with simultaneous
              measurements of particle/aggregate size, velocity and shape.  The effects of
              shear flow, Brownian diffusion, sedimentation, aqueous chemistry, and particle
              surface characteristics on aggregation will be investigated.  The experimental
              results will be introduced in a model applicable to natural and engineered
              systems.    The project will improve basic understanding of gravity-driven
              aggregation and sedimentation occurring in natural surface- and ground water
              environments, including chemical cycling, particulate dynamics, and contaminant
              redemption.  ***
