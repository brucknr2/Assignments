Abstract    :
                9422030           Although early theories recognized the multi-component
              nature of attitudes, only in recent investigations has clear empirical evidence
              been provided that attitudes that originate in feelings are very different from
              those that originate in thoughts and beliefs. By creating new attitudes in the
              laboratory, where the affective or cognitive origin of the attitude could be
              experimentally controlled, past research has revealed that affect-based
              attitudes, unlike their cognition-based counterparts, are (a) expressed with
              more confidence and (b) more susceptible to affective than to cognitive means
              of persuasion (Edwards 1990; Edwards & von Hippel, 1994).     Because many of
              the attitudes that are especially consequential for social behavior have been
              in existence for some time, the current program of research investigates 
              pre-existing attitudes to elucidate the mechanisms by which affect- and
              cognition-based attitudes develop and change.  The main objectives of the
              proposed research are to: (1) ascertain whether the effects previously obtained
               for newly formed attitudes are short-lived or persist; (2) determine whether
              the confidence and attitude change effects observed in past research on newly
              formed attitudes reflect differences in the way in which affect-based and
              cognition-based attitudes are represented in memory; (3) identify the way in
              which pre-existing affective and cognitive attitudes are represented in memory
              and ascertain the conditions under which they are most likely to be modified; 
              (4) examine the similarities and differences between newly formed and
              pre-existing affective and cognitive attitudes by inducing new attitudes and
              then monitoring their transition to "mature" attitudes over time.  Multiple
              means of inducing and assessing affect and for assessing the dominance of
              attitudinal components will  be employed in order to capture the range of ways
              in which affect can contribute to the evaluative character of attitudes.  Taken
              together, the results of this resea rch will contribute significantly to our
              understanding of the multi-component nature of attitudes, the factors that
              enhance their susceptibility to influence, and the importance of viewing affect
              as a distinct determinant of attitudes - in both the early and the late stages
              of their development.          Although early social psychological theories
              recognized that attitudes have multiple components, only in recent
              investigations has clear empirical evidence been provided that attitudes that
              originate in feelings (affect-based) are very different from those that
              originate in thoughts and beliefs (cognition-based). Affect-based attitudes,
              unlike their cognition-based counterparts, are (a) expressed with more
              confidence and (b) more susceptible to affective than to cognitive means of
              persuasion (Edwards (1990; Edwards & von Hippel, 1994). The recent
              investigations have relied exclusively on the creation of new attitudes in the
              laboratory where the affective or cognitive origin of the attitude could be
              experimentally controlled. Since, many of the attitudes that are especially
              consequential for social behavior have been in existence for some time (e.g.,
              attitudes toward ethnic groups, attitudes toward various social policies), the
              current research investigates pre-existing attitudes. Evidence from the study
              of both newly formed and pre-existing attitudes will elucidate the mechanisms
              by which affect- and cognition-based attitudes develop and change.  The results
              of this research will contribute significantly to our understanding of the
              multi-component nature of attitudes, the factors that enhance their
              susceptibility to influence, and the importance of viewing affect as a distinct
              determinant of attitudes - in both the early and the late stages of their
              development.
