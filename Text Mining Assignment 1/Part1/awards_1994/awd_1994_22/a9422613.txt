Abstract    :
                  9422413  Braford    With this award a research group at a predominantly
              undergraduate institution headed by Dr. Mark Braford will conduct studies on
              brain evolution.  Developmental and anatomical studies will be made of cell
              groups in the forebrain of ray-finned fishes.  These studies will allow the
              group to test hypotheses about the relationship of forebrain features in these
              fish to some of those seen in mammalian brains.  This work will yield new
              information that will help us to better understand how the brains of mammals
              were developed into their present form.   ***
