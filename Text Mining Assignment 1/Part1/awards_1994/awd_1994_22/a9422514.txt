Abstract    :
              SBR-9422541  Marjorie Honig    Twenty five years ago the most important
              influences on the decision by married women of when to retire were the
              husband's health and retirement status and family income.  In contrast, factors
              related to their reward for work-- wages, pension benefits, and social security
              entitlements-- were found to be insignificant in explaining when women left the
              labor force.  Because of the pervasive changes in the labor force behavior of
              women since 1970 and the dramatic increases in the rate of divorce, it is
              likely that the current generation of working women can no longer count on
              their husband's asset and pension incomes to provide economic security in
              retirement.  This is a matter for public concern because of the implications
              for the economic well-being of women after retirement.  Black and Hispanic
              women are particularly vulnerable since they are less likely to emerge from
              divorce or separation with significant asset holdings, given the low levels of
              wealth accumulation in those households.  The PI uses a new longitudinal data
              set, the Health and Retirement Survey, to examine the retirement expectations
              of women workers.  This analysis allows the PI to measure these women's
              expectations of their likely retirement income and well-being.  These
              expectations are also used to test the validity of three popular family labor
              supply models: the neo-classical joint utility model, the individual utility
              model, and the traditional family model.
