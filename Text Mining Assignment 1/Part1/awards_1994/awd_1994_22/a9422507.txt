Abstract    :
              This grant aims at achieving deeper understanding of the direct and  indirect
              extratropical response to tropical SST anomalies.  The  novelty here is to
              examine the global response to tropical SST  anomalies as a slowly evolving
              dynamical process (instead of a  steady process as in the previous studies). 
              The indirect response  includes the process of organizing extra tropical
              transient eddies  in to stormtrack anomalies and the subsequent symbiotic
              development  of the anomalies in both large-scale quasi-stationary waves and 
              storm tracks.    In practical terms, this research is important for improving 
              seasonal to interannual climate forecasting by dynamical physical  methods and,
              in theoretical terms, this is basic research that  leads to a better
              understanding of dynamical processes at work in  the long range evolution of
              climate and weather.***
