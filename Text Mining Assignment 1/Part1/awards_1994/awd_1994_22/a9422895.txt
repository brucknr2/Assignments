Abstract    :
              9422895    The Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy (COSEPUP)
              undertakes major independent studies of national issues in U.S. science policy
              and U.S. technology policy.  In recent years, for example, it has conducted
              prominent studies on U.S. policy goals for science and technology, policies
              related to global warming, integrity in the conduct of scientific research,
              U.S. policy for civilian technology, and recruitment and retention of
              Presidential appointees.    COSEPUP's core activities, including meetings of
              the Committee itself and a staff of two, are underwritten substantially by
              internal funds (individual studies are separately funded).  NSF has supported
              COSEPUP for 30 years.  Beginning in 1979 the NSF contributed to COSEPUP's core
              funds in a sequence of two five-year contracts (each allocating funds in five
              annual increments), and one two-year transition contract.
