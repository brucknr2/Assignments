Abstract    :
              The modelling of organized molecular systems such as biological membranes, using
              monolayer  assemblies at the air/water interface, forms the subject of this
              research project supported by the  Analytical and Surface Chemistry program. 
              Electron hopping in organized multimolecular  structures, and lateral
              translational diffusion of molecules on the water surface are the two main 
              topics of investigation in this work.  Langmuir-Blodgett techniques, Brewster
              angle microscopy,  and 2D electrochemistry involving "line" microelectrodes are
              the principal experimental tools  used in these studies.  The dependence of
              electron hopping rate on orientation of the donor-  acceptor pair in these
              organized monolayers will be determined.  The effects of hydrodynamic  coupling
              and viscosity of the interfacial layer on the diffusion of surfactant molecules
              on the  water surface will be investigated as well.  This information will help
              to develop an  understanding of molecular and electron transport through
              biologically important membrane  systems.    Molecular monolayer assemblies
              formed at the air/water interface are the focus of the research  of this
              project.  The lateral motion of electrons and surfactant molecules in these
              model systems  will be explored using a variety of optical and electrochemical
              methods.  This information will  be useful for developing models of membrane
              transport of importance in biological and  electroanalytical systems.
