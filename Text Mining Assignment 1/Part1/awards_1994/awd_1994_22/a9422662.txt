Abstract    :

              Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses a passivation coating for
              semiconductor laser diode optical facets.  Phase I showed that 980-nanometer
              quantum well lasers operated at high power with extended lifetime capacity when
              its laser diode facets were treated for passivation by cubic-gallium sulfide.  
                 In Phase II laser facet temperatures will be monitored by Raman
              spectroscopy, and failure modes will be evaluated by chemical and structural
              analyses.  Lasers to be used in Phase II will have a master oscillator power
              amplifier (MOPA) and unstable resonator 980-nanometer quantum well structures. 
                This technology is expected to find application in optical amplifiers in
              optical communication networks and more generally in passivation of gallium
              arsenide minority based devices, such as heterojunction bipolar transistors
              (HBTs), light emitting diodes (LEDs), and solar cells.  ***
