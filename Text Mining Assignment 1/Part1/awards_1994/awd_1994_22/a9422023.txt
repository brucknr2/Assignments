Abstract    :
              9422023  GRECZY         In order to promote a long term education effort 
              relating to important global change issues, the Subcommittee  on Global Change
              Research of the Committee on Environment  and Natural Resources (CENR/SGCR) is
              committed to sponsoring  the "Project Earthlink" education program.  Project 
              Earthlink educational efforts focus on the Intergovernmental  Panel on Climate
              Change assessments; the effects of human  actions on the environment; and the
              use of information  technologies for informed decision making.  These 
              educational efforts promote general awareness about global  change issues as
              well as enhanced accessibility to related  information and technologies,
              benefiting students at all  levels and the public at large.  These focus areas
              are  consistent with the goals of the Committee on Environment  and Natural
              Resources and the newly released "Science in the  National Interest" report
              from President Clinton.  Activities sponsored by Project Earthlink include a
              resource  guide for use by teachers and informal educators, a video  conference
              for teachers (May 1994), a Global Change  Education Conference (August 1994),
              and an Informal  Educators Workshop (November 1994).         Member agencies of
              the CENR/SGCR have reviewed the  merits of this program and have decided to
              support these  educational activities in Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995.  This 
              interagency agreement transfers $159,000 which originally  were transferred to
              NSF from the National Aeronautics and  Space Administration as its share of the
              CENR/SGCR  distributed-agency funding pool to the U.S. Department of 
              Agriculture for this purpose.
