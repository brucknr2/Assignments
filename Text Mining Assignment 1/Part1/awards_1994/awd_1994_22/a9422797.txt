Abstract    :
              9422797  Snyder    This research involves three projects designed to measure the
               relative importance of party in the U.S. Congress and the U.S.  state
              legislatures, and to test hypotheses about some of the  factors that may
              determine the importance of party.  The research  builds on the investigator's
              earlier work on legislative politics  and representation.    The first project
              develops and applies a procedure for  distinguishing between "party voting" in
              legislatures that is due  solely to similarity in legislators' preferences, and
              party  voting that is due to pressure from party leaders or party  caucuses. 
              The second project extends a previously developed  model of spatial party
              competition that treats political parties  as groups of self-interested
              individuals, not as monolithic  decision makers.  Finally, the third project
              investigates  initiatives and referenda that appear on state ballots.  This 
              research has three goals:  to implement a new test of the median  voter
              hypothesis against the hypothesis that political parties  enact different
              policies; to test for the importance of factors  such as factionalism and
              "professionalism" in state legislative  decision making; and, to test other
              hypotheses about political  agenda formation in the states, such as the
              importance of  "spillovers" across states.  ***
