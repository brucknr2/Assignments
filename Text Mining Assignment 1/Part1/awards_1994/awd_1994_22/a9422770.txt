Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9422770    PEARLSTEIN  UNIVERSIRTY OF ILLINOIS       A key problem
              in manufacture of multi-layered printed  circuit boards is rapid and uniform
              deposition of copper on  inner surfaces of plated "through-holes."  For
              conventional  boards (in which all interconnects are by means of through-
              holes) as well as boards also using surface-mount technology,  the trade-off
              between plating speed, uniformity, and deposit  ductility is such that
              acceptable yields are achievable only at  the cost of reduced speed, requiring
              large capital investment  and in-process inventory costs.  For holes of higher
              aspect  ratio in future boards, incremental modification of the  existing
              process will be incapable of providing the desired  uniformity at acceptable
              processing rates.          This project consists of a fundamental study  of the
              fluid mechanics and mass transfer of a radically new  approach to plating high
              aspect ratio holes.  The key idea is  to operate rotating screw electrodes
              (RSEs) in through-holes  of submerged boards.  The RSE generates radial,
              azimuthal,  and axial flow, leading to much more effective mass transfer  into
              and within the hole than is possible using conventional  technology. 
              Experiment shows the thickness of the resulting  copper deposit has much
              greater axial uniformity than is  achieved using the popular oscillating board
              technique, which  establishes time-periodic Poiseuille flow in the hole.  Flow
              modification by an axial pressure gradient,  whose magnitude will be chosen to
              give flow reversal, will also be considered.  This  will provide countercurrent
              mass transfer between oppositely  directed portions of the flow and suppress
              formation of  cation-depleted boundary layers in the central section of the 
              hole.          This approach will lay the foundation for  industrial evaluation
              and development of an improved plating  process for high aspect ratio
              through-holes currently being  developed.  The results will also have
              implications for  enhancing heat and mass transfe r in other applications.
