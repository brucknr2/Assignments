Abstract    :
              9422280  Chu PRIVATE      This research is concerned with inverse eigenvalue
              problems. Both the theory and the   practice of constructing a physical model,
              described mathematically in the form of a   matrix, from prescribed spectral
              data will be investigated.  This proposal continues and   extends previous
              studies.  In particular, a dynamical system for each inverse eigenvalue  
              problem will be formulated to ensure that a specific task is taking place
              continuously.  The   dynamics will then be explored using computer experiments,
              high resolution graphics and   symbolic manipulation, in conjunction with
              analysis. This study should lead to fundamental   advances in the understanding
              of inverse eigenvalue problems.  This project is expected to   find important
              applications ranging from new development of numerical algorithms to  
              theoretical solutions of difficult problems.  Since inverse eigenvalue problems
              arise from a   wide variety of disciplines, the resulting technology would have
              impact on a number of   scientific and engineering fields.    Inverse
              eigenvalue problems arise in many important applications, including control  
              design, vibration isolation, system identification, exploration and remote
              sensing, and   signal processing.  A significant common phenomenon in all these
              areas of application is   that the physical parameter of a certain system is to
              be reconstructed from knowledge or   expectation of its dynamical behavior, in
              particular its natural frequencies and/or normal   modes.  The advances
              obtained from this proposed work will contribute to the   understanding of
              issues that arise in several strategic areas, particularly in the areas of  
              global change, manufacturing, transportation, and environmental monitoring.
