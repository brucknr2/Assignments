Abstract    :
              People value status and often seek it as a reward for their  efforts in work and
              elsewhere.  Status is defined as high  rank on some dimension that is held by
              society to be  important.  The sources of status can be separated into two 
              main categories: those which are earned and those which are  unearned.  College
              graduates, for example, hold "earned"  status relative to high school dropouts
              while hereditary  rank represents an example of "unearned" status.  Status is 
              an inherently social phenomenon but one which is full of  economic
              ramifications.  Social psychologists understand  that status affects the way
              people treat each other.  Their  work shows that, for example, people will
              discriminate in  favor od people who have a status level similar to their  own,
              and against those with lower status.  Economists look  at these questions from
              a different angle.  What economists  want to know about status is whether
              people are willing to  continue to discriminate when discrimination costs
              money.  Economists also want to know whether status is valuable  enough to pay
              for it, and if so, how much people are willing  to pay.  These questions form
              the objectives in this pilot  effort.  The research explores the economic basis
              for the  value of status by creating status in an experimental  economic
              environment, for example, an experimental market.  Analysis of these
              experiments will compare subjects'  decisions based on whether they or their
              opponents had high  or low status.  This research will aid in understanding the
               ways in which status changes decision making and in the ways  status can be
              used to reward work efforts.
