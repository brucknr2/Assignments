Abstract    :
              9422135  Moon     This award is to purchase equipment for characterizing major
              disturbances and designing effective equalization schemes for high density data
              storage channels.  Advanced signal processing and communications techniques are
              playing an increasingly important role in improving reliability and storage
              capacity of magnetic data storage systems.  Although similar to most
              communication channels in many respects, magnetic storage channels suffer from
              channel disturbances that are considerably different from those observed in
              other communication channels.  Presently, a communication channel model
              describing the read and write processes in the high density magnetic channel
              corrupted by nonadditive media noise and nonlinear distortion is being
              developed.  The effective equalization and channel estimation schemes suitable
              for magnetic recording under such severe channel conditions are also being
              investigated.  Experimental disk spindle systems are under development to
              pursue the channel characterization and signal processing research.  The
              equipment will be used to develop these experimental test spindle systems to
              support several research projects, including in particular: characterization of
              nonlinearity, design of nonlinear equalizers, adaptive channel
              identification/equalization, characterization of transition noise, and design
              of a read transducer for narrow track recording.  ***
