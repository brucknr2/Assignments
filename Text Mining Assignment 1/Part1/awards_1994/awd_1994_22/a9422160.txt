Abstract    :
              9422160  Wang  This is an international travel award to enable the  Principal
              Investigator to :  (1) visit several institutions  in China to collect field
              and laboratory data as a follow-up  to the recently held US-PRC-Japan
              workshop/Symposium on  Lifeline Earthquake Engineering, (2) conduct technical 
              discussion with China researchers concerning practices in  lifeline design and
              earthquake countermeasures, and (3)  attend earthquake engineering seminars at
              Tsing-Hua  University and Xian University of Science and Technology.    The
              international engineering activity undertaken under this  project will enhance
              the program of the US-PRC Protocol in  Cooperative Earthquake Studies, Annex
              III which is jointly  implemented by NSF/ENG and the Ministry of Construction, 
              China. ***
