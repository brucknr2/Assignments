Abstract    :
              Abstract    9422602  Hicks    The objective of this collaborative project is to
              develop new  organometallic precursors for carbon-acceptor doping of indium 
              gallium arsenide (In0.53Ga0.47As) by metalorganic chemical vapor  deposition
              (MOCVD). A novel family of "site-specific" dopants will  be tested. The
              decomposition kinetics and doping efficiencies of  the sources will be screened
              in a micro-MOCVD reactor. In addition,  their mechanisms for decomposition on
              the InGaAs(100) surface will  be determined by infrared and x-ray photoemission
              spectroscopies  and by scanning tunneling microscopy. These studies will
              identify  the optimal compositions of the organometallic sources. Promising 
              carbon dopants will be used to grow InGaAs/InP heterojunction  bipolar
              transistors (HBTs). The performance characteristics of  these transistors will
              be compared to those synthesized using  standard zinc compounds for p-type
              doping. This research will have  a large impact on MOCVD growth technology. It
              will identify the  site-specific surface chemistry underlying acceptor doping
              of  compound semiconductors. Furthermore, it will hopefully solve the  problem
              of carbon doping InGaAs and InP, so that much higher  performance electronic
              devices can be synthesized by MOCVD. A team  of scientists from University,
              Navy, and Industry will participate  in this project. Partial support is
              provided by NSF for the portion  of the research conducted at the University. 
              %%%  Epitaxial thin films of indium gallium arsenide and indium  phosphide are
              used in a variety of electronic and optoelectronic  devices. Today,
              metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) of  these films is limited in
              scope because this process is not capable  of doping the layers p-type in high
              concentration and with sharp  dopant profiles. Carbon is the ideal acceptor for
              these  semiconductors. However, no organometallic compounds are available 
              which provide a high concentration of active carbon, while  maintaining the
              desired composition and crystal-qual ity of the  film. The objective of this
              project is to develop new  organometallic precursors for carbon-acceptor doping
              of indium  gallium arsenide by MOCVD. A novel family of "site-specific" 
              dopants will be tested.
