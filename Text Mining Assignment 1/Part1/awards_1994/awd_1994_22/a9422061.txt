Abstract    :
              DMS-9422061  Givant  Mills College, in collaboration with Carleton and St. Olaf
              Colleges and The George Washington  University plans to develop and operate a
              consortium of three programs to increase the number  of women who pursue and
              obtain advanced degrees in the mathematical sciences, and who  become active
              members and leaders of the mathematical community.  Growing out of the efforts 
              of the Mills Summer Mathematics Institute (1991-94), the consortium is a
              unified effort to bring  undergraduate women into mathematics at the highest
              levels.  It is the first major effort of its  type.  It will directly involve
              48 women students.  Carleton and St. Olaf Colleges jointly propose  a four-week
              summer program for 18 students at the freshman-sophomore level, with the focus
              on  conjecture and proof, as well as on the use of mathematical software for
              problem solving.  The  other two components of the consortium are aimed mainly
              at students at the end of their junior  year. The George Washington University
              proposes a four-week summer program in which 10  outstanding undergraduate
              women will be immersed in intensive short courses which will lead  them to
              interesting open problems.  Mills College will continue to develop and operate
              its  Summer Mathematics Institute, a six-week program for 20 excelling women
              math majors.   Students will take 2 or four seminars; each seminar will be led
              by a woman who is an active  research  mathematician.  Interactive, discovery
              learning and work on difficult problems will lead  to mathematical
              understanding.  All three programs will provide advice and information about 
              graduate school and careers in mathematics.  Among the most valuable aspects of
              the consortium  is the emphasis placed by each program on involving active
              women mathematicians as instructors,  TAs, and mentors.  The consortium will
              create a network of women mathematicians: faculty,  graduate students, and
              undergraduates, who will support and inspire each other to high  achievement.
