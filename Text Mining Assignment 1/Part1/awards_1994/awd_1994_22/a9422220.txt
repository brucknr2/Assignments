Abstract    :
              9422220  DORN       Considerable debate has occurred in recent years regarding 
              the dynamics of climatic change.  Prevailing models have held  that climates
              change gradually over periods of centuries.  A  growing body of evidence
              accumulated by Hartmut Heinrich and  others indicates that changes may have
              been much more abrupt at  various times during the last 70,000 years.  Four
              so-called  "Heinrich events" were characterized by the release of large 
              numbers of icebergs into the North Atlantic from the Laurentide  Ice Sheet
              covering northeastern North America.  Fine debris  carried by these icebergs
              have been found in cores of sediments  from the bottom of the ocean. 
              Correlative evidence of sudden  climatic changes in other parts of the world
              has been found in  terrestrial pollen accumulations, in glacial deposits, in
              lake  fluctuations, and in marine corals and sediments.  This research  project
              will involve U.S. and Mexican scientists in an  examination of glacial deposits
              on the slopes of Mauna Kea in  Hawaii and the volcanoes of central Mexico. 
              Both of these  highlands near the Tropic of Cancer are known to have been 
              glaciated during the period when Heinrich events occurred.  Glacial deposits
              will be dated using a variety of high-precision  dating techniques, including
              isotope analyses of 14-Carbon, 36-  Chlorine, 3-Helium, and 21-Neon.       This
              project will provide a detailed glacial chronology for  these tropical
              highlands, and it will assist in reconstruction of  transformations of soils,
              geomorphic systems, and biogeographic  systems in nearby lowland areas.  These
              data will advance  consideration of the hypothesis that Heinrich events were
              global  in character by assessing whether these rapid changes affected 
              tropical highlands.  The accumulation of evidence gathered  through studies
              like this will contribute considerably to  understandings of the dynamics,
              timing, and speed of global  change.
