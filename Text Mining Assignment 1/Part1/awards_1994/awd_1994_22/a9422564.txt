Abstract    :
              9422564  Coppens    This U.S.-Argentina Program award will fund a planning visit
               by Dr. Philip Coppens, of the State University of New York  at Buffalo, to go
              to Argentina to visit and consult with  Prof. Dr. Graciela Punte and her
              colleagues at the  Universidad Nacional de La Plata, active in the study of X- 
              ray diffraction, for the purpose of developing a  collaborative research
              project in charge density analysis of  molecules and solids, and in the study
              of excited state  species by diffraction and spectroscopic techniques.
