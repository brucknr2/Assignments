Abstract    :
              9422496  Ceperley  This research on the elctronic structure of condensed matter 
              systems is jointly suppported by the Divisions of Materials  Research, Advanced
              Scientific Computing and Mathematical  Sciences.  The research combines
              state-of-the-art research  on electronic structure with algorithm development
              for  massively parallel computers through support for both  computational
              scientists and physicists.  The primary  methods to be used are a combination
              of Quantum Monte Carlo  and Density Functional Theory.  Using these techniques
              a  wide variety of problems will be addressed including  excitations in quantum
              Hall systems, votices in superfluids,  silicon clusters, surface energies of
              metals, transport in  quantum dot systems and strongly correlated electrons in 
              copper oxide planes.  Algorithms are being developed for  independent electrons
              which scale linearly with the system  size.  %%%  This computationally
              intensive research will use the latest  techniques and computers to attack a
              variety of problems  involving the behavior of many electron systems in
              materials  and condensed phases.  The research is being jointly funded  by the
              Divisions of Materials Research, Advanced Scientific  Computing and
              Mathematical Sciences.  ***
