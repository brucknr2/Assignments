Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              will help the  Department of Chemistry at the University of North Carolina at
              Greensboro in the purchase of  a modern 300 MHz multinuclear NMR Spectrometer. 
              This equipment will be used in the  following areas of research:  alkene-CO
              copolymerization using palladium catalysts, kinetic and  mechanistic studies of
              benzocyclobutenyl-functionalized oligomers and polymers, NMR  investigations of
              chemical exchange processes in organic and biological systems, synthesis and 
              alkene polymerization studies of new metallocene catalysts, and structural and
              mechanistic  studies of coordination complexes of redox-active heterocyclic
              ligands.    Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful
              tool available to  chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. 
              It is used to identify unknown  substances, characterize specific arrangements
              of atoms within molecules, and to study the  dynamics of interactions between
              molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR  spectrometry is
              essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.  The results from
               these NMR studies are useful in the areas such as polymers and catalysis, and
              in biology.
