Abstract    :
              9422245  Ricles  In many regions of the United  States there exists several 
              reinforced concrete frame  structures constructed in the  1950's and 1096's
              which were  designed primarily for gravity load  effects.  The construction
              details  used in these structures can cause  non-ductile structural failure 
              under seismic loading.  As a  result, the performance of these  structures is
              considered suspect  for moderate to severe seismic  loadings.    This study
              focuses on seismic  retrofit of the columns of these  frames, which are the
              major reason  for their non-ductile behavior.  These column have insufficient
              lap  splices in the flexural hinge zone  as well as a lack of transverse  steel
              reinforcement along the  length of the member, making them  prone to
              lap-splice, shear, and  axial-flexural compression  failures.  Advanced
              fiber-epoxy  composite jackets will be used to  enhance the strength and
              ductility  of these columns:  (l) in the laps-  splice zone to create a
              confining  pressure on the splice, (2) along  the member to enhance the shear 
              capacity through a truss mechanism,  and (3) in plastic hinge zones to  provide
              ductility by confining  concrete in compression and  increasing shear capacity.
               Experimental testing will be  conducted to assess adtanced fiber-  epoxy
              composite jacket retrofit  designs considering the parameters  of material
              type, fiber  orientation, jacket stiffness,  active vs. passive jacket pressure
               systems, and cyclic uniaxial  lateral loading combined with axial  load.  The
              performance of the  jacket retrofit will be compared  with that of
              corresponding as-built  non-ductile columns under cyclic  loading.  The
              research program will  develop practical methods for  successfully retrofitting
              columns  using the fiber-epoxy wrap  composite material, and will  develop
              guidelines for retrofitting  non-ductile columns that can be  applied by
              practicing engineers.  ***
