Abstract    :
              This research planning grant will assess the feasibility of establishing an
              electronic elections database and   archive.  At present no single machine
              readable, constituency level source for election returns documenting   the
              world's democratic elections exists.  The goal of such an archive is to
              establish "one stop shopping" via   the Internet for all election data needs. 
              Data and codebooks may be held by the archive with file access and   download
              capabilities or, in instances of previously collected or copyrighted data,
              alternative sources and   access information will be provided.
