Abstract    :
                 The research proposed includes exploratory studies of actual methods used in
              corporations/business units that have been engaged in self-assessment,
              integration of those results into business unit planning processes, and
              identification of linkages among the assessment activities, planning
              activities, identification and implementation of improvement efforts, and
              subsequent changes in business processes and results.  Relationships to be
              tested include whether self-assessment improves results of planning efforts,
              whether self-assessment accelerates systematic improvement efforts, and whether
              self-assessment increases commitment to quality improvements.  The research
              will be conducted in eight organizations (Allied Signal, American Express,
              Henry Ford Health Systems, IBM Credit, Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble,
              Union Pacific Railroad, Xerox Business Services), and will include a series of
              working conferences to share results among cooperating organizations
