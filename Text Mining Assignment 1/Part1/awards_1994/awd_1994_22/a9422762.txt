Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9422762  RAAD  SOUTHERN METHODIST UNIVERSITY    The proposed
              research seeks to develop an experimentally verified, three-dimensional, finite
              volume method to simulate fluid flows whose free surface is undergoing severe
              deformations. The computational effort will be complemented by experimental
              work using an open channel flow apparatus and a high speed video camera to
              experimentally determine the shape of the free surface during transient and
              steady-state flows in an open channel containing obstructions. Simulations of
              water sloshing and waves breaking in a tank will be used to investigate the
              important mechanisms of the decay of turbulent vorticity on a very active
              surface and the penetration of turbulence into the main body of water below
              breaking and spilling waves. To complement the qualitative data obtained by use
              of the high speed camera, a digital particle imaging velocimeter will be used
              to obtain quantitative velocity data.  The proposed simulation method will
              represent a significant advance in free surface fluid dynamics. From a
              practical standpoint, the extension to three dimensions is most important,
              since the simulation must be three-dimensional to enable it to realize its
              potential as a manufacturing productivity tool in, say, die casting, or as a
              realistic simulator of violent fluid interactions such as in water rushing over
              and around dikes and bridge pillars.
