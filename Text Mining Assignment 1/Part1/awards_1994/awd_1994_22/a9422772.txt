Abstract    :
              The preservation of biodiversity is widely recognized to be an  important
              national aim.  Yet, very little actual help is  available, even at a high level
              of abstraction, to guide policy  makers towards the goal of optimally
              preserving biodiversity in a  world of limited budgets.  It is not even clear
              how to give a  quantitative description of what policy makers are actually
              doing  in practice.    The main objective of this study is to create a
              normative and  descriptive framework for analyzing the economics of
              biodiversity  preservation.  On the normative side, the goal is to construct a 
              cost-benefit methodology that can be used to rank priorities  among
              biodiversity preserving projects.  The basic ranking  criterion is a specific
              formula that, for the case of endangered  species, combines an appropriate
              measure of "distinctiveness"  with direct utility, change in survival
              probability, and cost.  A  rigorous justification for this ranking criterion is
              provided by  a straightforward optimization model.  On the descriptive side, 
              the goal is to combine a number of biological and economic data  sets to
              investigate econometrically the "revealed preference"  behind spending on
              endangered species.  Some very preliminary  results seem to indicate that the
              "visceral" direct utility  factor is far more important than the more
              "scientific" factors  of distinctiveness, survival probability, or cost.  ***
