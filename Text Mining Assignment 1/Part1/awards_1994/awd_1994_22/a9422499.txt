Abstract    :
              9422499  Wakimoto        Physical forcing that occurs on small spatial and time
              scales (mesoscale)  often determines the timing, location and severity of
              various weather phenomena.   The Principal Investigator proposes to apply
              principals of mesoscale analysis to a  variety of weather phenomena including
              tornadogenesis, study of convection in the  boundary layer along what is termed
              horizontal convective roles, and to the study of  oceanic cyclogenesis.       
              The tornadogenesis study is focused on determining the physical factors that  
              cause some severe thunderstorms to produce tornadoes while others do not.  The 
              Principal Investigator will participate in the second phase of the Verification
              of  Origins of Tornadoes Experiment (VORTEX)  as well as continue analysis of
              data  collected during the first phase in the Spring of 1994.  A unique aspect
              of this  investigation is the first use of airborne Doppler data for the study
              of tornadogenesis.        The study of horizontal convective roles is a
              continuation of analysis of data   collected during the Convection and
              Precipitation/Electrification.  This study is  focused on one of the most
              common types of boundary layer convection and will  include a study of how
              horizontal convective roles interact with the sea breeze.        The third
              component will investigate the fine scale details of oceanic  cyclogenesis
              using data from the Experiment on Rapidly Intensifying Cyclones over  the
              Atlantic.  Preliminary radar syntheses have revealed shallow mesoscale 
              circulations that form along an intense warm front.  This mesoscale feature
              appears  to be the incipient circulation that can lead to rapid cyclogenesis
              when it comes into  a proper phasing with an upper-level short wave trough.
