Abstract    :
              9422413  Ravenel       Neisendorfer's project is to compute the homology of
              certain  spaces that are inverse limits, for example, a union of infinitely 
              many spheres of radii converging to zero and with one point in  common.  Using
              the new algebraic result that an inverse limit of  connected free Lie algebras
              is free, methods of rational homotopy  theory can be applied.  Deeper results
              seem to be obtainable using  the geometric methods of Pontrjagin and Thom. 
              Ravenel is studying  problems in stable homotopy theory related to the
              telescope  conjecture.  This appears to be the best approach to understanding 
              the stable homotopy groups of finite complexes, which is one of the  oldest
              problems in algebraic topology.       In more general terms, algebraic topology
              is the study of  geometric problems (often in more than 3 dimensions) in their 
              qualitative rather than quantitative aspects, classifying and  counting
              structures rather than measuring their sizes.  For example  an essential
              difference between a 2-dimensional plane and a  3-dimensional space is that
              removing a line separates the former  but not the latter into two separate
              pieces.  Topologists have  devised methods called homotopy and homology for
              keeping track of  such properties systematically in very complicated geometric 
              objects (objects than can arise, for example, as the spaces of  solutions to
              sytems of ordinary or differential equations).   Neisendorfer and Ravenel's
              research is concerned with refining and  extending these methods.  ***
