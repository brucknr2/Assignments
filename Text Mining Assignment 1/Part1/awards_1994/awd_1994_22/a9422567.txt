Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              will assist the  Department of Chemistry at University of Rochester in the
              purchase of a modern single drystal  diffraction system.  This new
              instrumentation will enhance greatly research in a number of areas  including
              the following:  (1)  Studies of C-H and C-S bond activation in thiophenes; (2)
              The  catalysis of acyl-acyl coupling reactions with binuclear platinum group
              complexes; (3)  Electrophilic and radical processes in bond activation using
              cationic complexes of Rh(III) and  Ir(III) and d7 complexes; (4) Studies of the
              formation of aggregates and microcrystallites of  various dyes and
              photochemically reactive chromophores; (5) The development of asymmetric 
              synthesis methodology for natural products; and (6) The design and synthesis of
              catalysts for the  polymerization of monosubstituted olefins.    The X-ray
              diffractometer is used to make accurate and precise measurements of the full
              three-  dimensional structure of a molecule.  The information obtained gives
              the precise values of all  the bond distances and bond angles of a given
              molecule and it gives accurate information about  the spatial arrangement of
              that molecule relative to the neighboring molecules.
