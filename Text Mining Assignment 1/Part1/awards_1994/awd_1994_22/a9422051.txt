Abstract    :
              9422051  DOMOSH   This project combines several themes of current geographic
              research:  determinants of urban form;  expansion and maintenance of economic
              demand in wealthy societies;  and the effects of differential gender roles on
              the geography of the individual, household, and the local region.  The specific
              topic of the project is the ways in which New York's Broadway and Fifth Avenue
              became "Ladies' Mile," the premier shopping district for middle-class women in
              mid-nineteenth-century New York City.  The investigator will make use of
              atlases, photographs, popular magazines, trade journals, city directories, and
              women's diaries of the period to document the transformation, uses, and users
              of the district.  Data collection from the atlases, photographs, and
              directories will be straightforward, while the magazines and diaries will be
              subjected to content analysis and interpreted within the context of the
              original author and audience.  Under investigation are the relative
              contributions of advertising, the popular press, building characteristics, and
              mix of land uses to the image and success of this retail development.       In
              addition to documenting an important development in American mercantile
              history, the project's findings will contribute to the understanding of
              interaction among cultural, economic, and geographic developments within
              cities.
