              OPP-9422303 BURCH  The number of social scientists engaged in arctic research
              has grown substantially over the past two decades. This expansion in numbers,
              and in the variety of fields represented, has made it increasingly difficult to
              keep abreast of this research. The proposed project is intended to foster
              communication between social scientists and others working in the Arctic by
              creating a worldwide directory which could be made available free of charge to
              both individuals and organizations. The directory will further make known the
              expertise of arctic social scientists to northern residents and natural
              scientists.                                        ;
