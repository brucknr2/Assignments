Abstract    :
              This proposal will support the continuation of the U.S. STEP (Solar  Terrestrial
              Energy Program) Coordination Office, established in  December 1990.  STEP
              assists the U.S. science community in  components in spacecraft, ground-based,
              rocket, balloon and theory  and simulation programs capable of studying the
              complete set of  coupling mechanisms responsible for the transfer of matter and
               energy from the surface of the Sun to the surface of the Earth.   The
              continuation of this coordination office at the University of  Colorado will
              interact with domestic science programs for the  purpose of:  (1) collecting
              and disseminating STEP-related  information and data, (2) coordinating joint
              campaigns for data  acquisition and analysis which meet the national and
              international  science objectives of STEP, and (3) organizing professional
              society  meetings and special sessions.
