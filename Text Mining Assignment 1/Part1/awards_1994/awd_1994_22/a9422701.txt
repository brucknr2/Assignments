Abstract    :
              9422701 Weymouth  This award is made in support of the NSF initiative
              ENG-CISE-IITA94,  National Challenges.  It  is a joint initiative between the
              Engineering Directorate and the Computer Information and Engineering
              Directorate.  A collaborative test bed will be developed to support
              consultations between geographically distributed primary care pnysician and
              radiologic specialists and sub-specialists in tertiary care hospitals.  The
              focus will be on the design, implementation, and the evaluation of a prototype
              system for synchronous and asynchronous viewing of medical images over a
              distance.  This project will simultaneously address three research issues:
              adaptation of conventional medical dianostic practice to remote collaborative
              technology; creation of a toolkit of computer applications to facilitate
              adaption of these practices; and assessment of the impact of remote
              collaborative technology on medical diagnostic practice.  These three aspects
              of the study reinforce each other through the use of rapid prototyping
              strategy.  A working system will be delivered to physician users early in the
              project and then maintianed on a frequent cycle of user feedback, responsive
              redesign, and systematic evaluation.  To be successful, rapid prototyping
              approach requires the ability to correctly determine initial user needs, the
              ability to quickly evolve technology to meet these requirements, and
              continuously monitor whether deployed technology is satisfactory.  Therefore,
              this project team will be multi-disciplinary, encompassing physicians who will
              ofer expert input into the design and development process, computer scientists
              familiar with user-oriented aplplication development, and social scientists
              trained in the assessment of the impact of technology on work practices and
              routines.
