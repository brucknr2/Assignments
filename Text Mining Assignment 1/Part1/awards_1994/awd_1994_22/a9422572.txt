Abstract    :
              9422572  Hall  The research investigates the design, fabrication, and properties
               of electrically pumped concentric-circle-grating, surface-emitting  (CCGSE)
              semiconductor lasers.  Conventional Fabry-Perot  semiconductor lasers emit
              broadly diverging beams with elliptical  cross-sections.  An optically pumped
              A1GaAs/GaAs CCGSE laser has  already been demonstrated to emit a spectrally
              narrow (<1nm), low  divergence (1o), 10 milliwatt circular beam.  CCGSE lasers
              have the  potential for high power operation and superior beam quality.  Such 
              a laser would likely find widespread use in optical data storage, 
              communications, medical instrumentation, sensing, inspection, and  a variety of
              other applications.  ***
