Abstract    :
              Under the direction of  Professor David Hounshell, Mr. Hugh Gorman is examining
              the U.S. petroleum industry as a case study of the interaction between
              environmental regulations and technological development. The working hypothesis
              is that when an economic externality is in dispute--in this case, the negative
              costs associated with discharges into the environment--significant innovation
              occurs only after the interested actors reach consensus on how to measure,
              monitor, and assign liability associated with the externality. Only then can a
              technological, legal, and social infrastructure emerge that encourages change
              in the direction of consensus.  Mr. Gorman is examining each sector of the
              petroleum industry--production, transportation, refining, and consumption--to
              identify, at various intervals in the period 1921 to 1981, what engineers and
              managers perceived to be the state-of-the-art in preventing harmful discharges
              to the environment. What incentives did they have in further reducing these
              discharges? To what degree did direct economic losses serve as such an
              incentive? What incentives did insurance companies and professional
              organizations provide? What were the main barriers, technological or otherwise,
              preventing firms from reducing their discharges? What role did government
              regulations play, and was new technology or scientific knowledge needed to
              implement or enforce those regulations'? In summary, what patterns can be
              identified that advance our knowledge of how environmental regulations and
              technological development interact in a market society?
