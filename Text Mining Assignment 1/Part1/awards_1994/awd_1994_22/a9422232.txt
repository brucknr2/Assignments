Abstract    :
               This project involves the dissertation research of an anthropology student from
              the University of Florida.  The project is to study the impact of
              institutionalization on the performance of feminist non-governmental
              organizations (NGOs) in the Brazilian women's movement.   The student's
              hypothesis is that the more institutionalized NGOs will deal in issues more in
              the mainstream of Brazilian culture, stressing short-term concrete results,
              with fewer participatory procedures.   The less institutionalized are
              hypothesized to deal in more consciousness-raising, `empowerment` practices. 
              Data will be collected using participant observation, in-depth interviews,
              surveys of organization membership and a content analysis of written and oral
              material produced by each group and its grassroots beneficiaries.   This
              research is important because social movements are where cultural practices and
              beliefs are voluntarily transformed by a group of individuals.  Advancing our
              understanding of the procedures used by such groups and the social implications
              of the procedures, can help society design policies and programs to create more
              satisfying cultures.
