Abstract    :
              This renewal award is made in the Organic Dynamics Program in support of   the
              research of  Dr. Richard Caldwell.  Alkene triplets and triplet    biradicals
              will be studied (1) by conventional organic mechanistic   methods to determine
              chemical outcomes and infer the nature of the   intermediates; (2) by laser
              flash photolysis to determine transient   lifetimes and intersystem crossing
              rates, and energies  and kinetic   properties of transients, and; (3) by
              CAS-MCSCF computations of   spin-orbit coupling in small model systems. The
              results will lead to a   fundamental understanding of triplet biradicals and
              olefin triplets,   specifically their energetics and energy surfaces,
              conformations,   dynamics, and ultimately the role of all of these in
              determining the   outcomes of photochemical processes.  Among the triplet
              reactions which will be studied are ring-opening   rearrangements, olefin
              addition reactions,  and intersystem crossing of   olefin triplets. 
              Understanding the fundamental properties and mechanistic behavior  of  
              biradical intermediates will provide the chemist with the tools to design   new
              chemical reactions of alkene triplets and extend their role in   synthetic
              photochemistry.
