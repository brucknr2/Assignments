              Abstract  ATM-9422631  Miller, Ronald  Tegen, Ina  Columbia University  Title:
              Feedbacks Between Mineral Aerosols and Sahel Drought    This two year project
              is to study how mineral aerosols originating  as Saharan and Sahelian dust
              influence West African climate, when  the feedback s between dust and the
              climate are taken in to  account.  Earlier studies without such feedbacks have
              shown  significant influence of dust in suppressing Monsoon circulation  and
              rainfall over Sahel.  The project looks at the problem with  feedbacks.  Dust
              deflation and radiative heating parameterizations  developed by one of the PIs,
              will be incorporated in to a GCM so  that mineral aerosols can become fully
              interactive.  Experiments  will be performed to demonstrate the significance of
              the mineral  aerosol dust effect in such an interactive situation which is more
               realistic.    The proposed research is important to find out the effect of
              dust  on the climate of Sahel and to understand the implications of  different
              types of land use and agriculture.        Sankar-Rao Mopidevi  Date:
