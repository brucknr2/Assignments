Abstract    :
              9422255  Kenny  This GOALI proposal deals with the fabrication of high Q, single
              crystal, cantilevers for magnetic resonance force microscopy.  These
              cantilevers are to be fabricated with microelectromechanical sensors (MEMS)
              technology at the Stanford NNUN facility.  The PI plans to fabricate such
              cantilevers with the goal of improving the force detection sensitivity of a
              magnetic resonance force microscopy (MRFM) instrument to where atomic
              resolution may be possible.  Through an increase of the quality factor, Q, from
              106 to 108 and operation at low temperatures the PI expects to detect forces as
              low as 10-18 N/Hz1/2, which is several orders of magnitude more sensitive than
              present MRFM instruments.  This would be a fundamental advance in the ability
              to detect small forces - in fact, the ability to detect magnetic forces from
              individual nuclear spins.  Thus, this work would permit the realization of a
              micron-scale magnetometer with a ferromagnetic particle on the cantilever tip. 
              The cantilever motion would be excited by the torsional coupling between the
              ferromagnetic particle's magnetic moment and an external oscillating magnetic
              field.  One of the exciting possibilities of this research lies in the
              possibility of direct imaging of individual biological molecules (i.e.
              'molecular' imaging) which aids in the determination of the molecular structure
              of molecules.  STM and AFM techniques permit 2D "surface' imaging, but this
              technique could open the door to 3D imaging with the same resolution.  The
              GOALI program will be a collaboration between Stanford and IBM Almaden who have
              demonstrated a prototype nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) system.  ***
