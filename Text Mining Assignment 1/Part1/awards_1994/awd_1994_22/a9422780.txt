Abstract    :
                                        ABSTRACT    SBR-9422780  Hoffman, Donna  Vanderbilt U 
                This Research Planning Grant (RPG) addresses the problem of  marketing in
              computer-mediated environments (CMEs).  The  research models CMEs as
              large-scale (e.g. national or  global) networked hypermedia environments, of
              which the  Internet is the first and current global implementation.  The
              central thesis is that a CME is fundamentally different,  in nature, scope, and
              characteristics from other media.  Traditional media include both mass media
              (e.g. television,  radio, newspaper, magazines and direct mail), as well as 
              personal communications (e.g., word-of-mouth).  Numerous  characteristics
              differentiate CMSs from traditional media.  This research will investigate both
              decision-making  characteristics which affect consumer behavior in a computer- 
              mediated environment, and media characteristics which are  intrinsic to this
              environment and have implications for  marketing and communications strategy. 
              The goals of this  planning stage are: 1) a comprehensive literature review 
              encompassing all disciplines relevant to CMEs, including  marketing, behavioral
              decision theory, consumer behavior,  advertising, communication, psychology,
              computer-mediated  communication, and computer science; 2) a proposed 
              integrated theoretical framework for marketing in a computer-  mediated
              environment; and 3) a consequent set of testable  propositions that flow from
              the framework which will form  the foundation for a longer term research
              program on CMEs  and marketing theory.
