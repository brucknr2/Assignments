Abstract    :
              With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Glass of  the
              University of Arizona will develop a fundamental understanding  of the
              mechanism of electron transfer through sigma bonded systems.   Feasibility of
              efficient electron-transfer through strained  sigma-bonds, carbon-tin sigma
              bonds, and nonbonding p-atomic  orbitals aligned for sigma type overlap will be
              explored.   Prediction of sigma aromaticity will also be tested.  A number of 
              unique compounds will be synthesized to demonstrate the concepts  proposed. 
              Understanding how electrons are transported along hydrocarbon  chains is
              important to both materials and biological processes.   These results may
              provide a novel basis for designing electrically  conducting materials in which
              sigma orbitals and nonbonding sigma  systems are the basis for conduction
              rather than the  well-established conduction through pi-orbitals.  This project
              will  provide experimental results which are needed to substantiate 
              theoretical models.
