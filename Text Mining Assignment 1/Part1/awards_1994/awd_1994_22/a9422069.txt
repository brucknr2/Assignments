Abstract    :
              9422069  Jain     For the past decade, the importance of visual computing has
              increased exponentially.  Visual computing, which embraces processing,
              interpreting, modeling, assimilating, storing and synthesizing visual
              information, now plays a pivotal role in many fields.  These include such
              subjects as: virtual reality, multimedia, robotics, computer-human interaction,
              scientific visualization and communication.  This award is to purchase
              equipment for supporting a number of ongoing research projects that are
              committed to this important field.  The goal of these projects is to improve
              visual information computing through innovative experimental research.   The
              equipment which include two visualization systems, one real-time image
              processing subsystem, and a number of visual sensors will be dedicated to
              support four individual research projects each addressing a different aspect of
              visual computing, namely Visual Information Assimilation, Visual Interaction
              through Gesture Recognition, Modeling and Design of Optoelectronic Visual
              Information Processors, and Physics-based Visualization of Multipedal Walking
              Systems.  ***
