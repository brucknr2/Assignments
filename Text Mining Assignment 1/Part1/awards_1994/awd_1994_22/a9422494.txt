Abstract    :
              Dr. Philip P. Power, Chemistry Department, University of California -   Davis,
              is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic   Chemistry
              Program of the Chemistry Division to investigate   element-element and related
              bonding in the earlier main group elements.   The main thrust of the project
              involves the synthesis of new classes of   compounds which may have multiple
              bonds between heavier group 13 elements   and the preparation of kinetically
              stable, metal-metal bonded main group   2 and 12 element derivatives in which
              the metal has a formal oxidation   state of +1. The new compounds are designed
              so they will contain bonding   types not previously observed for these
              elements. By use of a variety of   spectroscopic and structural methods the
              characteristics of these bonds   will be probed in order to determine the
              nature of element-element   interactions between the earlier main group atoms. 
              The most important interactions which occurs in chemical compounds are   the
              bonding which links the constituent atoms to one another. For carbon   and
              other small non-metal atoms single, double, and  triple bonds are   well known,
              as are many correlations between the chemical bonding in a   compound and its
              chemical properties. Up until only a few years ago,   heavier atoms were
              thought to only form single bonds. More recently that   dogma was overthrown
              and this study is aimed at exploring the possibility   that atoms which are not
              known to form multiple bonds actually may be   capable of doing so. These
              studies have great significance to our basic   understanding of chemical
              bonding and open the way to the preparation of   new chemical systems which may
              display entirely novel properties.
