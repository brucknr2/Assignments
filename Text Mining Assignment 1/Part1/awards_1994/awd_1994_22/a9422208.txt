Abstract    :
              9422208  Hallock  This proposal has four major points of emphasis: (1)  To 
              continue  nuclear magnetic resonance and  third  sound  studies  of  the 
              helium3-  helium4 mixture  film  system,  specifically  to study the strong
              effect on the helium3 of  the  helium4  film thickness with analogy with metal 
              insulator transitions in 2D electron systems, and to search  for transitions to
              new superfluid helium3 behavior which  have  been predicted. (2) To continue
              experiments with  helium films  on  alkali metal surfaces in order to study 
              wetting  phenomena. (3)  To  study  in  more detail  capillary condensation 
              and  avalanche phenomena  with  helium in porous materials. (4) To continue  to
               study  helium  films patterned substrates in one and two  dimensions.  (5)  To
              study  linear  and  nonlinear  behavior  of  third  sound  pulses   in
              collision. The techniques used  will include nuclear magnetic resonance,
              bolometric and  quartz resonance  and capacitance   measurements.  These 
              experiments   will develop  our  understanding of the helium  film system and
              have  impact more widely in Condensed Matter  Physics.  %%%  This  program  
              will  undertake a fundamental investigations  of  thin films  of  liquid 
              helium  which form on  surfaces  at  extremely  low temperatures.  These 
              films, which can be  a  few  atoms  thick,  have remarkable properties and
              allow  the study of physics in two dimensions which have  implications for
              physics in other areas of Condensed Matter  Physics. The emphasis will be on
              studies of mixtures of the  two  types of  helium in which new types of
              superfluid  behavior will be  searched for.  Analogies  with metal  insulator
              transitions  will  be  explored. Peculiar  wetting  behavior between helium and
              certain unusual surfaces will be  investigated. Capillary condensation and
              other phenomena in  porous materials flooded with helium will be studied. The 
              program will also  investigate the interaction between  microscopic waves on 
              helium films and between such waves  and th e surface on which they reside.
