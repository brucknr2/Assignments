Abstract    :
              This project will develop a cross-national data base that will enable social
              scientists to analyze the role that mass values and attitudes play in
              sustaining democratic institutions, and in providing support for environmental
              protection policies.  It brings together public opinion survey data from more
              than 40 societies representing 70 percent of the world's population and
              covering the full range of variation, from societies with per capita incomes as
              low as $300 per year, to societies with incomes one hundred times that high;
              and from long-established democracies to recently emerging democracies and
              authoritarian states.  It will also integrate these data on mass attitudes,
              with societal level social and economic indicators such as income levels,
              literacy rates, and presence or absence of democratic institutions.  This
              unique data base will make it possible to analyze the impact of mass attitudes
              on stable democracy; or between economic development and worldviews of the
              respective publics.  Because key questions in these surveys have been asked
              repeatedly over a period of many years, these data will also make it possible
              to analyze trends over time.
