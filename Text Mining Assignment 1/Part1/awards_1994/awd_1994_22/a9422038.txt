Abstract    :
              9422038  Rice     This award is to purchase ATM network equipment and a high
              performance visualization machine to support five research projects.  Four
              projects need to pre- and post-process massive data sets on a supercomputer;
              this requires  high performance for both visualization graphics  capabilities 
              and  networking.   The fifth project needs the network for its studies in high
              performance interactive simulation with networks of heterogeneous computers.  
              The network will connect the 140-processor Paragon in the Computing Center with
              research laboratories in the Computer Science Department;  it will also
              interconnect various machines in these laboratories.  The high performance
              graphics machine will allow  effective visualization in the laboratory of
              massive data sets (3D to 5D with hundreds of megabytes) arising from 1) partial
              differential equations (5D data sets are generated by functions defined on 3 
              space dimensions and time), 2) geometry modeling and imaging in  medical,
              geophysical and design applications, and 3) macromolecular structure analysis
              for viruses and proteins.  The graphics machine will be shared with the
              heterogeneous network project.  ***
