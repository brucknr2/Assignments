Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the synthesis of corannulene homologs   containing
              16, 21 and 26 rings.  These derivatives will be used to form   upramolecular
              complexes with C-60 and other fullerenes.  Other targets   include barrelyne
              and 60-carbon molecules that could provide key   intermediates for the
              preparation of endohedral complexes of C-60.   New   understanding in the area
              contains the potential for the rational   development of new advanced
              materials.  With this renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is
              supporting the   research of Dr. Lawrence T. Scott of the Department of
              Chemistry at   Boston College.  Professor Scott will focus his wok on
              constructing    novel organic molecules.  The target compounds are
              characterized by by   highly condensed, convex networks of trigonal carbons
              that map onto the   polyatomic framework of the fullerenes.  New understanding
              in this area   could lead to the rational development of advanced materials
              having   potential importance in the emerging realm of nanotechnology.
