Abstract    :
              9422656  Hoffman  There are a number of interdisciplinary issues which are
              nascent in  network building associated with the "information superhighway" -- 
              privacy, pricing, and equity, to name a few.  Often a broad view of  these
              issues is only available to those who can attend a number of  independently
              scheduled policy/issues meetings in Washington.    This project brings together
              experts on these topics at a fixed  time each month to discuss them.  A summary
              of their talks will be  made available for an international audience both in
              paper and in  electronic form afterwards and will be obtainable from all over
              the  world.  Videotapes of each lecture will be made and available at  costs. 
              Moreover, making some or all of these videotapes available  electronically over
              the Internet will be explored, and done if  feasible.
