Abstract    :
              9422549  Vithayathil    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
              project explores a new concept for a brushless exciterless three-phase
              synchronous motor.  Experimental confirmation of brushless excitation was
              established in Phase I.  An adjustable speed AC drive system will be developed
              in Phase II.  The system will consist of the brushless exciterless synchronous
              motor, the three-phase inverter, and the controller.  The motor will have a
              full load output of 15 horsepower, and its magnteic core laminations will be
              specifically tailored to the brushless excitation scheme.  The controller will
              use vector control implemented with digital processing of signal and inputs
              from isolated current sensors and a shaft position sensor.  Base speed will be
              1800 rpm, and the upper limit of the speed control range will be 3000 rpm with
              field weakening.    Potential commercial applications of the new drive system
              are expected in machine drives, mill drives and other industrial drives
              requiring high dynamic performance, and in electrically powered vehicle drives.
