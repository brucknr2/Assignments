Abstract    :
                                                                     9422215  Zue           
              This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research to investigate issues related to
              speech  recognition and speech understanding involved in the use of the Mosaic
              World Wide Web (WWW)  browser.  The speech recognition issues involve lexicon
              selection, language model generation, and  whether the recognition should take
              place in the client or in a dedicated server.  The speech  understanding issues
              consider the interpretation of queries and the retrieval of relevant documents,
               information access, data fusion, and discourse and dialogue maintenance.  The
              response generation  and synthesis aspects also consider the implementation of
              multilingual response generation given the  international character of the WWW.
