Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9422752    A theoretical and computational approach will be
              undertaken to study multiphase flow in a rotating field.  The main objective is
              the development and implementation of a boundary integral method for solving
              the linearized equation of motion in rotating viscous flow at relatively low
              Reynolds numbers (O seen approximation), and considering the Taylor columns
              formed around individual particles or bubbles.  The study of multiple particle
              interactions, with and without the presence of solid boundaries, will provide
              insights into the microstructure of rotating suspensions and determination of
              rheological behavior.  A visualization experiment to describe the Taylor column
              interactions of two particles is planed.    The proposed study has relevance to
              separation process in environment, minerals and biology; mixing in combustion
              and processing industries; manufacturing of composite materials; and
              geophysical fluid motion.  ***
