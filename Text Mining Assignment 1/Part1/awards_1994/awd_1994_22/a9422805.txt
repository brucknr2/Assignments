Abstract    :
               This is a project to create unified documentation for individual-level samples
              of the United States census, covering the years: 1850, 1880, 1900, 1910, 1920,
              1940, 1960, 1970, 1980, and 1990.  These microdata have proven to be a valuable
              resource, since they allow researchers to make tabulations tailored to their
              specific research questions and to overcome incompatibilities in the published
              census tabulations.  In addition, the public use microdata samples have made it
              possible for researchers to move beyond simple tabular analysis and apply
              increasingly sophisticated multivariate techniques.  This project will enhance
              the compatibility of variables over time and incorporate the 1850 and 1920
              census years into the data series.  %%%   The public use microdata samples from
              United States population censuses are of great value in several fields of
              social science, permitting a variety of researchers to carry out scientific
              tests of general theories concerning socio-economic trends, migration patterns,
              social change, and several other aspects of American life.  Proper
              documentation and comparability of variables and coding across samples will
              increase the value of the data sets for researchers and educators.   Already
              some of these data and codebooks are available over Internet or the World Wide
              Web, and they will be an important part of the national information
              infrastructure
