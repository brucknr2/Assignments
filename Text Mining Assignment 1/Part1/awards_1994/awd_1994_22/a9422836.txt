Abstract    :
              Will the expansion of democratic governance in Africa lead to a strengthening of
              national identities and a consolidation of nation-states or will it lead
              instead to an intensification of ethnic, religious, regional or linguistic
              identities and the emergence of sub-national groups with revisionist demands? 
              This research will assess the impact of democratic political change in two
              Central African nations, Zambia and Malawi following recent transitional
              elections.   Attitudinal surveys will be conducted in each country with
              questions repeating those conducted in earlier surveys.  This design permits
              longitudinal analysis of political cleavages in these nations that are
              undergoing rapid political and social change.
