Abstract    :
                  ABSTRACT  9422263  NABOKOV/CASSADY      Cancer is the leading cause of death
              among Alaska Native women and the third leading cause of death among Alaska
              Native men. This dissertation research will investigate Inupiat Eskimo
              perspectives about cancer and trace how these views influence health decisions
              and activities. To date, scientific research has failed to examine the Native
              cultural context of cancer and how Alaska Native apprehensions about the
              environment are integrated into the fabric of everyday life. This study will
              contribute to theories of medical pluralism and the social and cultural basis
              for beliefs about environmental health risks.  ***   ??
