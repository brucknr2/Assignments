Abstract    :
              9422539  Sarkees    This Career Advancement Award for Women project has two
              primary  components:  the expanding of the investigator's capability to 
              conduct quantitative research through taking advanced statistical  methods
              courses; and, conducting an investigation into the  properties of the
              international system structure.    The award will allow the investigator, who
              has a very heavy  teaching load at her home institution, to take time off and 
              collaborate with a senior investigator at the University of  Michigan.  The
              University of Michigan professor is the principal  investigator on a major
              project in international relations  entitled the "correlates of war."  The
              collaboration will upgrade  the investigator's skills and increase her
              professional  capabilities.  ***
