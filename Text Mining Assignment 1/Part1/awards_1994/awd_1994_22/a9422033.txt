Abstract    :
              9422033  Schwan    This award provides support for the acquisition of a
              computational cluster of 10 Sun SPARCstations, and 2 user-interface capable SGI
              Indy workstations. The research projects to be supported include interactive
              scientific programs, distributed collaboration, interactive simulations, and
              efficient state sharing in interactive systems.      A goal of the research is
              to develop systems and user interface technologies that will allow the
              realistic solution of problems using computing, networking and user interface
              capabilities. Primary research projects include on-line interaction with
              scientific simulations running on multiple, networked parallel machines;
              collaboration support systems that will allow users to collaborate over long
              distances; interactive simulations that will allow end users to run and view
              system simulations in conjunction with actual system operation; and development
              of operating system technologies that address the efficient sharing of state on
              single parallel machines and across multiple networked workstations or
              supercomputers.  ***
