Abstract    :
              9422424    Seltzer    The primary objective of the proposed project  is to
              obtain continuous, high-resolution, AMS  14C datable proxy records of
              glaciation and vegetation change from lacustrine sediment cores that span the
              last deglaciation and Holocene from four regions in the tropical Andes where
              evidence for abrupt climatic reversals during the last glacial-to-interglacial
              transition have already been documented.  The PIs seek to improve not only the
              chronology of  late-glacial climatic oscillations in the tropical Andes but
              also to improve the basis for interpreting the sedimentologic and palynologic
              records.  Specifically, the PIs propose: i) to couple glacial geology and
              glacial-lacustrine sedimentology to provide estimates for the timing , rate,
              and magnitude of changes in glacier equilibrium -line altitudes during the last
              deglaciation,   ii) to couple modern vegetation studies with palynological
              analyses of sediment cores from the western Amazon Basin to estimate the timing
              of and paleoclimatic factors responsible for the abrupt changes in vegetation
              that marked the last glacial-to-interglacial transition in this region, iii) to
              collaborate with Ecuadorian geologists to date and characterize geochemically
              conspicuous tephra units that were deposited during the last deglaciation so
              that these important isochrons may be used to correlate precisely among proxy
              records of paleoclimate preserved in sediment and ice cores from different
              sites in the tropical Andes, and iv)  to provide closer age constraints for
              specific moraines, which, based on both preliminary and published radiocarbon
              ages, were deposited at about the same time as the YD and H1 Events.
