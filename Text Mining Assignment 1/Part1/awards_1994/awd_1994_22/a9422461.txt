Abstract    :
                                                                                     9422461 
              Novick             This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) project
              investigates extending the Mosaic  hypermedia browser to include spoken
              language as an input via interaction with a remote server with  speech-capable
              documents and the recognition systems needed for their use.  The investigation 
              involves the access to a set of speech-capable documents in a server in the
              laboratory  via hot-links  with spoken language resources, thus providing a
              single platform recognizer as a potential uniform  test-bed rather than
              differentiated recognizers for a variety of platforms and performances.  Spoken
               language interactive applications are developed for server platforms providing
              maximum  transportability.  The project extends the accessibility to browsing
              in a multimedia environment while  serving as a data collection and
              experimentation tool as well as a realization of the usefulness of  spoken
              language interfaces.
