Abstract    :
              9422885  Mathias  This project encompasses fundamental investigations of 
              monomer synthesis and polymerizations based on  multifunctional acrylates. 
              Recent results demonstrate the  ability to control rates of polymerization for
              monoacrylates  with a variety of pendant functional groups at the alpha  methyl
              position including halides, ethers and especially  esters.  The latter display
              unexpectedly rapid  polymerizations which make them excellent candidates for 
              hard and rapidly generated thin films via  photopolymerizations.  Diacrylates
              linked at the alpha  methyl position with ether, carbon and amine or amide
              groups  provide entry to high glass-transition-temperature materials  with
              multiple functionality pendant from the polymer  backbone.  The steric and
              electronic effects of these  substituents on the efficiency and stereochemistry
              of the  cyclopolymerization process leading to 5-and/or 6-membered  rings in
              the polymer backbone will be explored.  The  combination of pendant groups that
              can be incoprorated makes  possible applications in microlithography,
              biological and  drug uses, catalytic and supernculeophilic reagent  materials,
              and modifiers for commercially important  acrylates and methacrylates.  %%% 
              This project encompasses new monomers and polymers which  lead to materials
              with greatly improved physical and  chemical properties.  These materials have
              enhanced  capabilities for use in photolithography and  microelectronics,
              anti-cancer and biological materials,  surface coatings and encapsulation, and
              property enhancers  for currently used acrylate, methacrylate, and stryrenic 
              materials.  ***
