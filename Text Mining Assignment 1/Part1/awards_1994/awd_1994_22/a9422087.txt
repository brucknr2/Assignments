Abstract    :
              9422087  Nakajima     This award is to purchase a VLSI tester which will be
              dedicated to support research in computer and information science and
              engineering.  The equipment will be used for several research projects,
              including in particular: High-frequency Digital and Analog Electronic and
              Optoelectronic Integrated Circuits, Prototyping and Testing Integrated Circuits
              for Biological Applications, Minimizing the Cost of Production Testing of
              Analog Integrated Circuits, Prototyping and Testing of High-Performance VLSI
              Signal/Image Processors, and Prototyping and Testing of Application-Specific
              RISC Processors and Concentrator Switches.  ***
