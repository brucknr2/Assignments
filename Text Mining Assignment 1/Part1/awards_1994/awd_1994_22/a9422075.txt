Abstract    :
              9422075  Hough    Radio and optical studies of quasars will be carried out in
              order to  contribute toward the unification of the physical models which
              describe  the active galaxies and quasars.  Quasars are thought to be young, 
              distant, powerful galaxies that may harbor supermassive black holes in  their
              central regions.  However, they may be just an extreme example of  the general
              phenomenon of active galaxies in which unusually large  power output from the
              nuclear regions is observed.  In order to test  the various hypotheses that
              attempt to unite the theories about the  quasars with other active galaxies -
              including BL Lac objects, radio  galaxies, and Seyfert galaxies - a carefully
              selected, complete sample  of twenty-five of the most powerful quasars known
              will be studied.  Radio telescopes working in unison as interferometers will be
              used to  Make radio wavelength images of the quasars, from their very centers
              to  huge radio-emitting regions up to a million light-years away. The time 
              sequences of images for the central regions will permit a study of  apparent
              faster-than-light, or "superluminal", motion observed in these  quasars. 
              Optical observations will be made to obtain the spectra of  the light emitted
              from these quasars, and hence we will learn something  of the physical state of
              the gas surrounding the central object.  The  statistics of various radio and
              optical properties of these quasars  will be used for rigorous tests of
              "unified models".  The results of  the observations may possibly be used to
              calculate the size and age of  the universe.  Additional observations, which
              will push the resolution  limits of the radio astronomy techniques, will be
              carried out.
