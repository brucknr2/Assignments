Abstract    :
              9422248  Telionis  During many flood events flood waters, overtop levees and 
              flood control water works fail, sometimes leading to  catastrophic results. 
              Inflatable dams could  be a more  effective option for the protection of
              specific structures  and facilities. This project will study the behavior of 
              these dams subjected to a parallel or an oblique flow of  water on one side of
              the dam, to the effect of impacts from  debris, and of various levels of flood
              waters.  Experimental, analytical and numerical methods will be used  to better
              understand the hydroelasticity and fluid mechanics  of inflatable dams under
              flood conditions.  The mitigation  measures resulting from this study will
              benefit many flood-  prone regions in the country.  ***
