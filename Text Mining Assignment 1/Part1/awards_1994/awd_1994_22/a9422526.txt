Abstract    :
                  9422526  ORING   The study of habitat fragmentation has been built upon
              understanding how lost habitat, isolation of habitat patches, and increased
              habitat edge lead to declines in populations.  This understanding has, in turn,
              formed the foundation for principles of reserve design in conservation biology.
               In order to design reserves in the future, traditional studies of
              fragmentation must be augmented.     This study will evaluate the effects of
              fragmentation using a population of American avocets (Recurvirostra americana).
               Research will be conducted at three scales.  At the individual scale,
              mark/resighting methods will be used to understand individual movement
              patterns.  At the population scale, system dynamics modeling will be used to
              construct a population model.  At the landscape scale, data will be used to
              develop a spatially explicit understanding of the relationship between patches.
                Research conducted will make theoretical and applied contributions to the
              field of conservation biology.  First, it will provide direct answers to
              applied questions about reserve design and conservation of inland wetlands. 
              Second, it will evaluate the importance of wetland loss versus wetland
              degradation for avian populations.  This understanding is critical to the basic
              principles of scientific reserve design wherever loss and degradation of
              habitat are occurring, and findings will have application to reserve design
              worldwide.
