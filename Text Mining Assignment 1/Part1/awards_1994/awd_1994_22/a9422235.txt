Abstract    :
              This starter grant award to Purdue University supports the research of 
              Professor Raftery.  The theme of the research is surface chemistry in a 
              variety of atomic-size photocatalytic particle systems.  The goal is to 
              develop a clearer picture of surface structure and reactivity of  semiconductor
              phtocatalysts.  Optical methods are applied to initiate  chemical reactions at
              the surfaces of the photocatalysis, while high  resolution methods in solid
              state and liquid phase NMR spectroscopy are  used for detection.  NMR methods
              are used to probe the structure of  adsorbed reactants and products, measure
              the reaction kinetics, and  identify intermediate or transient species in
              several important model  reactions.  This research combines optical and NMR
              methods to study gas and liquid  phase photocatalysts to advance fundamental
              understanding of the nature  of photocatalytic reactivity.
