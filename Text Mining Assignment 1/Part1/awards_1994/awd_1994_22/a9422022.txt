              Ball The long term goal of this research is to gain an understanding of the
              structure and functioning of the cation transporter, Na,K ATPase, with a
              particular interest in elucidating the molecular mechanisms of digitalis
              (cardiac glycosides) binding and inhibition of this enzyme. The P.I. proposes
              to use a relatively new and perhaps unconventional approach to identify and
              characterize short peptide sequences which may mimic the glycosides, which are
              nonpeptidic steroid based plant products. The peptides will be selected from
              bacteriophage contained "random peptide libraries". The diversity of these
              selected peptides will help us understand how the glycosides bind and how their
              actions may be modified. In addition, since the enzyme's digitalis binding site
              has not been determined, the P.I. will also attempt to use anti idiotypic
              antibodies (raised to anti digoxin antibodies) to identify the binding site.
              The random peptide libraries will also be used to determine whether it is
              possible to generate a model digitalis binding site(s) This work has the
              potential of enabling us to identify serum  proteins which serve as natural
              regulatory proteins. %%% The  Na,K-ATPase is a membrane bound enzyme that uses
              energy in the form of ATP to transport sodium and potassium ions across the
              cell membrane.  It is this maintenance of the levels of these two important
              cations that is the driving force for the active transport of small molecules
              such as amino acids, glucose, phosphate and calcium, as well as providing the
              basis for the action potential in nerve and muscle cells.  The Na, K-ATPase is
              also the receptor for digitalis, a plant glycoside, which inhibits the enzyme
              in a highly specific manner.  This project uses a new immunological approach to
              learn more about the mechanism of digitalis binding, and should in addition
              help in identifying the long sought after natural, or endogenous, molecule that
              acts to regulate the enzyme.
