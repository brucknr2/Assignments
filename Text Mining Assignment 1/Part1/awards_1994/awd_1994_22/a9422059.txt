Abstract    :
              9422059  Gabriel    Support  is  provided for a collaborative  proposal  between
               Dean  Gabriel,  University  of  Florida,  and  Deng  Xiuxin,  Huazhong 
              Agricultural University, Wuhan, China, on  genetic  transformation  of citrus
              for resistance to  Xanthomonas,  a  major cause of disease in citrus.    The
              research proposed contains innovative ideas to combat  a  serious  disease of
              citrus. There will be a two way exchange  of  biotechnology:  research training
              in  molecular  cloning  from the US, and citrus tissue culture expertise from
              China.  Through  the  cooperation  of Chinese  and  US  laboratories  working 
              on this important problem, both practical knowledge  important  for a major US
              and Chinese crop, and  fundamental  knowledge  in  plant  biotechnology will 
              be  advanced.  The  genetic  work on manipulation of bacteria will  be  done 
              in  Florida and complementary work including bioassays and field-  testing  of 
              the genetically altered citrus  lines  will  be  conducted  in  China.   The 
              international  cooperation   is  essential   to   the  success  of  the 
              project,   providing  complementary expertise and opportunities for field 
              testing  not available in the United States.    Support is recommended.
