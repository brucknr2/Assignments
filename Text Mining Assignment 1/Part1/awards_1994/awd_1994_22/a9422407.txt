Abstract    :
                MONCZKA  The objectives of the research are to develop an explanatory model of
              the successful integration of suppliers into the new product development
              process through identification of  both successful and unsuccessful strategies
              and practices, and factors that explain them.  The results of the research will
              include implementation guidelines for other firms to follow, and case studies
              and models of supplier integration into new product development for use by
              industry and academia.  The research will be based on a literature, review,
              field research, and surveys.  Field research will be conducted in ten or more
              firms (Allied Signal, AT&T global procurement, Black & Decker, Chrysler Corp.,
              Deere & Co., Hewlett-Packard, Kodak, Unisys, Whirlpool, and participants in the
              Arizona State University Center for Advanced Purchasing) currently integrating
              suppliers into the new product development process.  The survey research will
              collect data from (2000 plus) members of the Global Procurement & Supply Chain
              Electronic Benchmarking Network.  The plan also includes periodic meetings of
              interdisciplinary industry and academic review teams to advise on research
              design, interpretation and dissemination of results.
