Abstract    :
                The proposal requests funds to partially support the 1995 Seminar  on
              Stochastic Processes to be held at the University of Florida   March 9-11,
              1995.  This will be the fifteenth in a series of  annual conferences, begun in
              1981, giving eminent researchers,  young specialists and graduate students the
              opportunity to work  together to discuss the most recent advances in stochastic
               analysis, potential theory and Markov processes.  There will be  five formal
              one-hour lectures and about nine hours of shorter and  more informal
              presentations.   At the informal sessions, seminar  participants volunteer to
              give short presentations of their  current research.  For young researchers,
              this is an invaluable  opportunity to showcase their work, as well as to learn
              from the  senior members of the audience.
