Abstract    :
              As the credibility and professional integrity of scientific investigators have
              come under question, academic institutions have developed policies and
              guidelines regarding the ethical conduct of research.  But the policies may not
              be consistent with the norms of scientists or the exigencies of research
              careers.  The specific aim of this investigation is to characterize the
              professional norms of  researchers and compare them with those expressed by
              institutional representatives.  The investigators will develop a quantitative
              scenario-based survey methodology to evaluate scientists' beliefs regarding
              norms of professional ethics.  They will administer the survey to a sample of
              NSF awardees in molecular and cellular biology.  The results will be compared
              to those of a group of institutional representatives with expertise in research
              ethics.  The survey instrument will be designed with the help of three
              four-hour focus groups, two consisting of active scientists and one of
              representatives.  The instrument will use scenarios in which several factors
              can be varied systematically.  Subjects will be asked to give ratings of the
              scenarios, from fully ethical to highly unethical, and to indicate what
              actions, among a list of possibilities, should be taken in response.  Results
              will be published in articles and presented at professional meetings.  The
              study will lead to increased understanding of the ethical beliefs held by
              persons in research environments at colleges and universities.  It may assist
              in the development of policies and guidelines by these institutions and federal
              agencies and, if effective, provide a tool for further study of norms in other
              fields of science.
