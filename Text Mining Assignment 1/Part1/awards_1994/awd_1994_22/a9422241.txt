Abstract    :
              9422241     This grant  builds on the PIs' previous finding of implicit gender
              stereotyping, whereby an apparantly unconscious process of incorrectly
              assigning fame to familiarized male names generalizes only weakly to
              familiarized female names.  The major goal of the renewal period is to develop
              efficient individual- difference measures of implicit attitudes and
              stereotypes.  This effort will build on findings from the initial project
              period that, together with recent findings from other laboratories, suggest
              that judgment-  latency methods are most likely to prove successful for this
              purpose. The statistical technique of confirmatory factor analysis will be used
              to examine sensitivity, reliability, and validity of the newly developed
              measures.  Efficient theory-based measures of implicit traits should be of
              great value not only to future research on this project, but also to many other
              researchers and, ultimately, in applied settings.    The research is designed
              to contribute to the goals of NSF's Human Capital Initiative, specifically in
              the social context of disadvantage.  Consistent with these goals, a program of
              research  examines basic processes involved in categorizing people into groups
              and  in the stereotyping associated with those social categories.  By
              elucidating the role of implicit stereotyping in sustaining discrimination and
              by developing and validating measures of implicit stereotyping and prejudice,
              the proposed research will contribute basic tools that will be useful in
              applied research aimed at overcoming discrimination and disadvantage.
