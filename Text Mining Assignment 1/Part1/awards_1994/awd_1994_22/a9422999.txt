Abstract    :
              Professor David Oxtoby, University of Chicago, is supported by a grant   from
              the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to continue his   research
              in theoretical studies of nucleation.  Oxtoby uses techniques of   statistical
              mechanics, specifically density functional methods, to   explore phase changes
              involving liquids: the condensation of liquids from   the vapor and the
              crystallization of liquids to form solids.  The rates   of these phase changes
              depend critically on the process of nucleation,   the first appearance of a new
              phase at the center of an existing   metastable phase.  Oxtoby's work seeks to
              apply new theoretical   approaches to predict the rates of formation and the
              atomic structures of   the critical nuclei that from the barrier to the
              formation of new phases.    The theoretical approaches being developed by
              Oxtoby will be applicable   to both the nucleation of liquids from gases and
              the nucleation of   crystalline solids from liquids.  A familiar example of
              nucleation of liquids from gases is the   condensation of water vapor in
              clouds.  There is considerable current   interest in the formation of polar
              stratospheric clouds, which are   thought to play a key role in the depletion
              of ozone over the poles.  In   all such processes, the first barrier which must
              be surmounted is the   formation of critical nuclei on which other molecules
              then condense.    Oxtoby's research will lead to a theoretical molecular level 
               interpretation of the nucleation event in such systems.
