Abstract    :
              9422817  JAROSZ       Although considerable attention has been given to 
              globalization of manufacturing industries, dramatic changes also  have
              transformed agricultural enterprises.  Global food  productive systems now are
              characterized by vertical and  horizontal integration of multinational
              corporations and by  capital- and labor-intensive production, processing, and 
              distribution networks.  This Research Planning Grant will enable  a productive
              female investigator to continue development of an  international comparative
              research project.  This project will  explore how changing divisions of labor
              in the apple industries  of the U.S., France, and South Africa have evolved
              over recent  decades as industries in all of these regions have become 
              competitors for Asian and European markets.  The research will  rely on
              historical and archival research as well as focus groups  and interviews with
              owners, operators, and workers in different  facets of the industry.  This
              award will facilitate refinement of  research plans in South Africa and
              Washington state.       This award will continue the development of a research 
              project with great potential.  The project will compare the ways  that changing
              divisions of labor among different class, ethnic,  and gender groups are
              related to globalization of agricultural  industries in different regions. 
              Through these analyses, more  complete understandings will result of the
              opportunities and  constraints facing each of the regions as they try to
              develop  socially and environmentally sustainable agricultural systems  that
              are economically competitive in global markets.
