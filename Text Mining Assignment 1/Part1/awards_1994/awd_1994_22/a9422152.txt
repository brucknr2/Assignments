Abstract    :
                  With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Collum of Cornell
              University will  investigate the dynamic effects of ligating solvents on the
              reactivity of alkyl lithium complexes.   Since these reagents are commonly used
              in organic syntheses, this research will have a  significant impact.     The
              efficient use of natural resources for the synthesis of materials and medicinal
              drugs requires  a series of reagents.  Optimization and understanding of these
              reactions provides a more efficient  process which preserves resources.  Since
              alkyl lithium is often used, its reaction characteristics  are of immediate
              interest.  This is a very significant investigation.
