Abstract    :
              9404689  Anantharam       This project involves fundamental research in the
              modelling,  analysis, and design of the next generation of communication 
              networks.  Specific projects include: 1) the investigation of  recently
              proposed classes of models for bursty traffic with  particular emphasis on the
              behavior of queues driven by such  traffic; 2) the development of a novel, game
              theory based approach  to the optimal design of control and resource allocation
              strategies  at network elements; 3) the use of timing information to 
              communicate over highly noisy asynchronous data links; and 4) the  
              investigation of stability questions and characterizations of the  dominant
              stationary regimes in packet switched and circuit switched  networks.       The
              research will use stochastic models and a range of  mathematical tools from the
              theory of stochastic processes,  stochastic game theory, large deviations
              theory, and information  theory.  Successful completion of the proposed
              research would lead  to an enhanced understanding of the characteristics of the
              next  generation of networks, and will provide techniques for informed  choice
              among design alternatives.  Several parts of the research  will lead to
              prescriptive methodologies for different aspects of  network design.  ***
