Abstract    :
              9422286  Kalina  NSF is a major participant in the Federal High Performance and 
              Computing Program (HPCC), along with several other Agencies. HPCC's  goal is to
              accelerate the rapid development of future generations  of high performance
              computers and networks and to bring the results  of the program into widespread
              research, educational, commercial  and general public use. The National
              Coordinating Office (hosted by  the National Library of Medicine) coordinates
              the programs of the  participating agencies, and serves as a liaison to a
              variety of  parties ranging from the Congress, through academia and industry, 
              to the general public and the Executive Branch.     This award provides the
              National Library of Medicine with support  for the Foundation's share of
              National Coordinating Office  responsibilities connected with the HPCC program.
