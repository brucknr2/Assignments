Abstract    :
              Dr. David R. Tyler, Chemistry Department, University of Oregon, is  supported by
              the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry  Program of the
              Chemistry Division for studies on the reactivity of  organometallic free
              radicals. As one portion of the investigation the  cage effect, i.e. the effect
              responsible for the greater reactivity of a  radical pair in solution than in
              the gas phase, will be probed. A variety  of `cage efficiency factors`, a
              number that expresses the efficiency of  radical cage pair combinations, will
              be accumulated for a variety of  radical pairs which differ in mass, size, and
              shape. These data will  provide predictive understanding of the cage effect.
              The second part of  the project involves an investigation of the reactivity of
              17- and  19-electron organometallic species in aqueous solution. New methods
              for  generating water soluble organometallic radicals will be developed and 
              the fundamental reactivity and catalytic properties of the radicals will  be
              systematized.  Each electron in a chemical compounds is usually paired with
              another.  However, there are some compounds which contain an  unpaired
              electron.  These are called radicals, they often are quite chemically reactive,
              and  there is a growing realization that they are involved in many chemical 
              processes. The object of this project is to uncover the principles which 
              control the chemical behavior of metal containing radicals and to  develop
              radicals which can dissolve in water. Since water is an  environmentally
              friendly solvent, the ability to generate radicals in  aqueous solutions will
              permit reactions which normally must be  carried  out in organic solvents to be
              performed in a less polluting medium.
