Abstract    :
              The PIs propose to develop a robust production planning and control scheme that
              is adaptable to shop floor uncertainty.  The project will be a Private Sector
              Initiative with joint funding by the Bethlehem Steel Corporation.  The problem
              the PIs hope to solve is the achievement of a production process which can
              achieve global managerial objectives while allowing for input from the shop
              floor as changes and local constraints emerge.  The PIs' approach is to extract
              critical decisions from the production planning process and to solve them. 
              Decisions left unresolved are made on the shop floor, thus allowing for
              adaptation to changing shop conditions.  The PIs will further develop the
              theoretical and computational issues and will extend the approach to address
              the specific situation at Bethlehem Steel.
