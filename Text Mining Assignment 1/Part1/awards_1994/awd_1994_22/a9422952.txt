Abstract    :
              Using circuitry which is driven by ultrafast repetitive  laser pulses, Dr.
              Grischkowsky has developed a complete  optoelectronic THz beam system which can
              generate and detect  200 fsec pulses of freely propagating THz radiation with a
               time resolution of 65 fsec.  Based on this optoelectronic  THz beam system, he
              has pioneered the field of THz time-  domain spectroscopy (TDS).  In this
              proposal he seeks to  explore the limits of THz-TDS with respect to both 
              sensitivity and dynamic range.  Transmission measurements  requiring extreme
              dynamic range will be performed on samples  such as semiconductors and normal
              and superconducting metal  films as well as hot samples, flames and plasmas. 
              The PI  further plans the precise measurement of coherent THz  transients from
              molecular vapors and the direct observation  of THz propagation effects through
              dense vapors.
