Abstract    :
              9422558  Stroh    This Doctoral Dissertation Research Support project develops a
               psychological theory of salience.  There are two types of  considerations
              which affect salience, stable considerations  (where issues are always on the
              agenda) and contextual  considerations (where media coverage or candidate
              positions  determine whether the issue is on the agenda).  Past research 
              demonstrates how the media may influence voter preferences  through framing,
              priming and agenda setting.  In this research,  other considerations (candidate
              positioning and the number of  candidates) are examined which may influence
              salience regardless  of the amount of media coverage devoted to an issue. 
              Three  models are developed to explain why issues are salient to voters: 
              utility difference, similarity, and threshold.  The models are  tested using
              survey research (the 1992 National Election Studies  Presidential Election
              pretest) and experimental studies.    The research addresses a fundamental
              question which has not been  studied adequately in voting research, namely,
              what makes issues  salient.  Searching for possible answers to this question
              will  benefit the study of elections in the future.  By identifying  possible
              sources of issue salience, the proposal may offer new  explanations of how
              issues influence elections.  ***
