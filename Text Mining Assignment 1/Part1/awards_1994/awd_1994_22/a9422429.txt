Abstract    :
              9422429  Hamermesh  How much people work has been a central focus of labor
              economics  during most of the last 50 years.  When people work -- the timing 
              of work during the day -- has received almost no attention.  This  neglect is
              mainly due to the paucity of data on this issue.  That  is unfortunate, since
              changes in the distribution of work and  leisure over time affect households'
              well-being.  This project  will use the only available data to examine a
              variety of issues  in the timing of work.  It is motivated by the apparent 
              substantial changes that have occurred even during the last  decade in the
              United States in the distribution of work hours  over the work day, and by some
              simple cross-section evidence for  the U.S. and Germany on the importance of
              young children in  affecting spouses' joint decisions about timing leisure.   
              The project involves an entire research agenda of studies in the  general area.
              It includes examining: 1) how the timing of work  changed between 1973 and
              1991. The focus will be on decomposing  changes into those produced by changes
              in industrial structure,  demographic characteristics, and unmeasurable
              effects. 2)  Life-cycle variation in the timing of work and how it has changed 
              among successive cohorts of workers, using artificial cohorts of  workers
              constructed from an 1 8-year succession of Current  Population Survey data; 3)
              how changes in a households'  demographic structure affect timing, with a
              particular  concentration of the roles of marriage and fertility and with 
              applications to the availability of child-care arrangements,  using two-year
              panel data; 4) how timing varies over the business  cycle, and what these
              changes imply about the welfare effects of  unemployment; and 5) the impact of
              urban crime and urban  disamenities generally on timing, with a focus on how
              changes in  measurable and unmeasurable characteristics of urban areas have 
              altered the timing of economic activity.  ***
