Abstract    :
              This study will examine the interplay of scientific, ethical, and cultural
              judgments in evaluating the restoration of natural and urban environments. 
              Restoration has become a centerpiece of ecological and urban policy.  Yet the
              concept of restoration is rife with ambiguities and conflicting
              interpretations.  The proposed study, conducted by an interdisciplinary team of
              two philosophers, an ecologist, a geographer and an urban planner, will examine
              and compare the issues raised by natural and urban restoration.  The
              investigators will focus on three areas where restoration projects are underway
              or being planned:  the Severn River basin and the Baltimore neighborhoods of
              Marble Hill and Butcher's Hill.  They will examine the diverse and sometimes
              conflicting visions of restoration that underlie these projects and, more
              broadly, explore the roles of science, history, and culture in evaluating
              restoration projects and adjudicating the conflicts they engender.  The
              investigators will write a coordinated series of papers, reporting their
              analysis of restoration issues and their studies of specific restoration
              projects.  These papers will be submitted to journals of public, environmental,
              and urban policy, and collected into an anthology.
