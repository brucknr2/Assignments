Abstract    :
              Carbon electrodes are widely used in a broad range of technologies including
              energy conversion,  metals production, and analytical sensors.  This research
              project, supported by the Analytical  and Surface Chemistry Program, uses
              various Raman spectroscopic probes to obtain information  about the structure
              of carbon electrode surfaces in various electrochemical environments.  
              Resonance Raman spectroscopy of adsorbed probe molecules is used to examine
              specific surface  sites.  Unenhanced surface Raman spectroscopy is applied to
              the study of adsorbate overlayers  on the carbon surface.  This structural
              information is correlated with the activity and stability  of these electrodes
              in various applications, including microanalytical methods applications.    In
              order to understand the reactivity and stability of carbon electrodes widely
              used in  electrochemical technologies, surface structural information is
              essential.  Raman spectroscopic  probing of the carbon electrode surface is the
              subject of this research project.  The structural  information obtained from
              these studies helps to design and modify electrodes for energy  conversion and
              electrocatalytic and sensor applications.
