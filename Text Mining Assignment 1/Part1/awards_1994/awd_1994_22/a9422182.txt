Abstract    :
              9422182  Irene    The principal scientific objective of the research is to 
              elucidate the mechanisms of deposition, film formation and  interface reactions
              for high temperature superconductor  films and heterostructures.  In order to
              accomplish this  objective two complimentary techniques, namely time of  flight
              ion scattering and recoil spectroscopy and  spectroscopic ellipsometry will be
              used for in-situ real  time analysis of the film formation and interactions of
              the  high temperature superconductor films and heterostructures.  It is
              anticipated that this research program will not only  produce considerable
              information about the formation and  interface reactions of high temperature
              superconductor and  ferroelectric films and heterostructures, but also the 
              knowledge necessary to implement a fully integrated time of  flight ion
              scattering and recoil spectroscopy, spectroscopic  ellipsometry, ion beam
              sputter-deposition system for the  preparation of these complex materials and
              structures.
