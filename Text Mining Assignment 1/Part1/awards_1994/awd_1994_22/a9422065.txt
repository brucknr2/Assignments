Abstract    :
              9422065  Board     This award is to purchase a large, shared memory,
              multiprocessing workstation with accelerated 3-D graphics which will be
              dedicated to support research in computer and information science and
              engineering.  The equipment will be used for several research projects, all of
              which require expensive computations to be performed on large data sets.  The
              jump from two dimensional to three dimensional modeling in many of the
              application areas listed below requires a major increase in system memory and
              CPU power, and the 1 gigabyte memory shared between several processors will
              make many 3-D simulations possible.  Visualizing the results of 3-D simulations
              in many scientific disciplines, and other image processing applications, is
              also a major challenge, requiring both significant CPU power and large memory;
              the equipment is suited to this task as well.  Five specific projects are:  1)
              parallel molecular dynamics computations, with particular attention to load
              balancing; 2) image compression using random neural networks; 3) parallel ocean
              acoustic signal processing; 4) extension of bi-domain methods for simulation of
              excitations in cardiac tissue to 3-D; and 5) visualization and analysis of
              large data sets from a 3-D ultrasound machine.  ***
