Abstract    :
              9422010  Goel  Recent earthquakes have  demonstrated the life safety  hazard
              posed by unreinforced  masonry (URM) wall structures.  It is proposed to
              strengthen  the URM walls by fiber  composites. The flexibility,  light weight
              and high tensile  strength of composites makes  them an ideal material for 
              strengthening masonry  structures.  A recent study  has demonstrated that 
              significant increases in  strength and ductility could  be achieved for static 
              loading.  The primary  objective of this research  project will be to study the
               in-plane cyclic behavior of  unreinforced masonry (URM)  walls strengthened
              with fiber  composites and to develop  analysis and design procedures  or
              seismic strengthening of  existing URM structures.  Six  wall specimens,each 
              approximately 8 ft wide and 10  ft tall, will be tested. Two  different height
              to thickness  ratios (h/t = 14 and 28)  constructed of one or two  wythes of
              bricks will be  examined. Composite fabrics  epoxied to the wall will  either
              fully cover both faces  of the wall, or will be  applied as vertical strips 
              spaced apart and staggered on  the opposite faces of the  wall.  Test results
              will be  used to develop design  guidelines for retrofitting of  URM
              structures. The proposed  research will be closely  coordinated with a parallel
               research investigating the out  of plane cyclic behavior of  fiber reinforced
              URM wall at  the University of Arizona.  ***
