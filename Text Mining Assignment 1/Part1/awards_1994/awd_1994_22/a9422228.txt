Abstract    :
                STERMAN  Accumulating evidence suggests that for many firms, including winners
              of the Baldrige award, successful quality improvement programs have not led to
              greater business success.  The researchers hypothesize that productivity gains
              from successful quality programs can interact unfavorably with existing
              routines and structures.  Unrecognized interdepencies may cause unanticipated
              side effects that cause firms to take actions that ultimately lead to the
              demise of otherwise successful programs.  The researchers will study five
              organizations to identify the nature of such interactions and assess the
              circumstances in which they feed back to undercut the benefits of successful
              quality initiatives.  Hypotheses were generated and research methods developed
              based on a preliminary study of the unanticipated side effects of quality
              improvements at Analog Devices, Inc.  This research will begin with development
              of case histories of the quality program in five firms (AT&T, Bose, Ford,
              Harley-Davidson, National Semi-Conductor) then develop formal models of the
              systematic impacts of quality programs on firm dynamics.  A `Management Flight
              Simulator` will be developed based on results to allow managers and students to
              understand challenges facing organizations as they implement quality programs.
