Abstract    :
              SBR-9422670  William Brock    In real-world economic markets, traders base their
              actions on their predictions about the future.  The choice of predictor,
              furthermore, is purposeful.  That is, it is based on how ell the predictor has
              performed in the past.  Predictors that do well relative to other predictors
              are gradually adopted.  But their increased popularity reduces their predictive
              power.  It follows that the distribution of predictors is determined by a
              complex dynamical system that can be expected to behave chaotically.  In the
              first part of this multi-project study, the P.I. studies this dynamical system
              both analytically and through numerical simulation.    The second project
              examines the equilibrium production of information in speculative markets. 
              Information here means the ability to detect noisy signals and equilibrium
              means a rational expectations equilibrium.  Superior information translates
              into higher profits but this information is costly to acquire. The P.I. applies
              the methods of the first project on adaptive dynamics to the study of the
              evolution of this market to an equilibrium. The resulting model predicts many
              stylized facts about actual speculative markets, such as those for stocks.
