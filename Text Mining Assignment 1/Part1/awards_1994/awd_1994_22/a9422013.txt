Abstract    :
              Nontechnical summary    Relationship Among Demographic, Social, and Genetic 
              Structure    Recent results from Altmann's studies provided the most  complete
              genetic analysis of any wild nonhuman primate group  and identified paternity
              and genetic structure in a baboon  group that is striking for its reflection of
              observed  behavior.  The analyses relating social structure, behavior,  and
              genetic structure can now be extended to enable  evaluation of the magnitude of
              variability over time and  space for these long-lived animals that, like
              humans, mature  slowly and exhibit a considerable range of behavior and  group
              composition.  The extent of variability in behavior  and in its effects on
              genetic structure is important for its  implications for evolution and
              biodiversity.  A second major  goal of the present study, therefore, will be to
              identify  particular behavioral and other mechanisms that produce the 
              relationships between social and genetic structure.  These  include
              investigations of the conditions and mechanisms  whereby mate choice and
              alliances modify the power of male  dominance status to determine paternity and
              those whereby  close relatives are recognized and avoided as mates when the 
              ubiquitous mechanism of emigration from the group of birth  is not sufficient
              for avoiding inbreeding.  These kinds of  behavioral and other mechanisms are
              essential components of  basic evolutionary processes.  They may also be
              significant  determinants of survival under critical conditions such as  low
              population density or population fragmentation, in which  case an understanding
              of mechanisms and their functioning  can provide not only a potent predictor of
              population  response but also a powerful management tool for shaping  outcomes.
