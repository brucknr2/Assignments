Abstract    :
              9422295  Blumenthal  The NRC established the Computer Science and
              Telecommunications Board in recognition of the importance of (1) computer
              science as an academic discipline and intellectual domain and (2) the
              increasingly critical role played by computing technology and
              telecommunications in virtually all facets of life.  The Board's charter is a
              broad one; to ensure that the United States makes every effort to develop and
              use the major national resources represented in computer science, computing
              technology, and telecommunications.  The computer's contributions to innovation
              and economic growth, to national security, to the quality of life, and to
              scientific progress are pervasive and affect the programs of a number of
              federal agencies, as well as domestic industries.  Before the Board was
              established, no organization had been suitably positioned to address or
              influence the overall condition of the computing and communications field.   
              CSTB is intended to be a central asset for identifying the implications of new
              technologies; assessing current and proposed policies that affect computer
              science, computing technology, and telecommunications posture.  It also fosters
              communication among members of the professional community on national and
              international issues in the computing and communications fields.  ***
