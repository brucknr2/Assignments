Abstract    :
                This research explores how indigenous Maya Indians in Yucatan, Mexico, local
              immigrants and non-governmental organizations manage forest resource systems. 
              The project focuses on the roles of information and communication in the use
              and governance of common-pool resources.   Three questions will be studied: 
              What is the structure and content of local ecological knowledge that enables
              successful commons management?  What is the character of the communications
              networks that make possible assimilation, distribution and implementation of
              this information? and to what extent is loss of local knowledge and disruption
              of communication networks related to a breakdown of the commons?   The general
              background issues are what lessons do micro-level approaches to increasingly
              threatened commons systems hold for the future of global commons such as the
              earth's forests, ranges, water and air?  Methods will include ethnographic
              fieldwork in Campeche, Yucatan, Mexico.    Field researchers will interview
              individuals for their cognitive models of resources using intensive open-ended
              interviews as well as close-ended questionnaires and psychological tests to
              study mental models, social networks, and the social distribution of ecological
              knowledge.  Consensus analysis will be performed on local communities to study
              the distribution and patterning of ecological knowledge.  In addition the range
              of biotic resources available to the community will be surveyed as a form of
              `ground-truthing`.    This research is important because systematic analysis of
              local community-based knowledge and beliefs and the linkages between this
              knowledge and practices will help societies plan to conserve natural resources.
               This is the human dimension of both local and global change in the
              preservation or breakdown of common property resources.
