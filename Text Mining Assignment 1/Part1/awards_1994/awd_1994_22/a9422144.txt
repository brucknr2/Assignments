Abstract    :
                9422144  Gross  Continuing support is provided for the international
              oceanographic  activities of the Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research
              (SCOR)  that are relevant to U.S. interests in marine sciences and the 
              Division of Ocean Sciences.  There are currently thirty-seven  countries
              represented in SCOR.  The Ocean Studies Board of the  National Academy of
              Sciences serves as the U.S. national committee.    Individual ocean scientists
              participate in SCOR activities through  subsidiary bodies such as working
              groups and scientific steering  committees.  Funding will support two major
              SCOR activities: 1)  U.S. sponsorship of focused SCOR Working Groups. 
              Presently, there  are twelve such Working Groups covering diverse ocean-science
               related topics.  Working Groups are comprised of experts from  different
              countries who meet on a regular basis to discuss and  assess the scientific
              status of their topic area and produce a  report that advises and provides
              recommendations for further  research efforts.  2)  Science Steering Committee
              activities of the  Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) and the Global Ocean 
              Ecosystem Dynamics (GLOBEC) program; both are part of the U.S.  Global Change
              Research Program.  These major programs have origins  in U.S. and have turned
              to SCOR to provide a forum for  international planning and coordination. 
              SCOR's impact has and  will continue to be evident in the standardization of
              measurement  protocols, sharing of data, coordination of ship time, and the 
              enlargement of field studies which would be impossible without  international
              coordination.
