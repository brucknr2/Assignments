Abstract    :
              9422896  Arnold       This Small Grant for Exploratory Research award will
              develop and implement  several new physical mapping algorithms on parallel
              computing architectures.   Ordering clones from a genomic library into physical
              maps of whole chromosomes  present a central computational/statistical problem
              in genetics and is providing  fundamental insights into development, gene
              organization, chromosome structure, and  recombination.  This team will
              investigate several strategies for parallelization of these  algorithms (i.e.,
              random costs, neural networks, simulated annealing) on various  parallel
              architechtures in order to (i) improve map quality, (ii) develop new 
              computational intensive tools for assessing map reliability by bootstrap
              resampling,  and (iii) assess the benefits of using a parallel computing device
              as a network server  for constructing physical maps.   ***
