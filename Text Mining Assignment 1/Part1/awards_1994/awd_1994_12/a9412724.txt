Abstract    :
              9412724  Magee    This project involves a collaboration between French
              scientists  from the (French Industry/University Cooperative Research Center 
              (I/UCRC)) Institut National des Sciences Appliquees (INSA-Lyon)   and the
              University Claude Bernard, and American engineers from  I/UCRC for Hazardous
              Substance Management Research at New Jersey  Institute of Technology and
              Rutgers University.   The objective of  this research is to establish a
              scientific methodology that brings  together in a more comprehensive way the
              microbial, physico-  chemical, and engineering considerations needed to
              understand,  plan, and diagnose in-situ bioremediation projects.  This project 
              involves (1) selection of various soil matrices from both the U.S.  and Europe;
              (2) addition od substituted aromatic compounds as model  pollutants to the
              soils; (3) adsorption/desorption measurements;  (4) description of the
              microbial ecology; (5) investigation of the  impact of chemotaxis; (6)
              determination of the biokinetic rates and  parameters in batch flask and soil
              columns under aerobic and  denitrifying conditions; and (7) selection of
              suitable sites in  both the U.S. and France for field tests of the laboratory 
              conclusions and methodologies.  The researchers of both I/UCRCs are  well
              qualified to perform this joint research project.  An  evaluator is funded to
              study the international industry/university  interaction occurring during this
              project.    The Program Manager recommends that the New Jersey Institute of 
              Technology be awarded $264,000 for 36 months ($240,000 for the  project and
              $24,000  for the evaluation study).
