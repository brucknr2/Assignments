Abstract    :
              9412633  Foss      This work consists of a collaboration between the PI and
              researchers at the Ford Motor Company.  The PI will spend one semester of a
              sabbatical leave at Ford working with various colleagues in the fluid mechanics
              area.  It is expected that there will be substantial collaboration during this
              period.  It is also viewed as likely that continuing funding from Ford will be
              available as the result of the PI identifying significant problems to which he
              can contribute.  It is also expected that the knowledge gained by the PI will
              directly impact upon on-going courses he offers and that new and relevant
              examples will be brought into the classroom and laboratory.  ***
