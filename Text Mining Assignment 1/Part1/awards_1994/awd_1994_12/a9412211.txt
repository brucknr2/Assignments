Abstract    :
              This award will support collaborative research between Dr.  David Loper of
              Florida State University and Professor  Ibrahim Eltayeb of Sultan Qaboos
              University in Oman.  By  means of a series of working visits, Drs. Loper and
              Eltayeb  will undertake two projects in the broad areas of Applied  Mathematics
              and Fluid Dynamics.  These projects involve  analyzing the stability of certain
              fluid motions that occur  in a variety of natural settings including metallurgy
              and  geophysics.     The proposed research projects are part of the fabric of 
              current scientific interest in the structure and dynamics of  the Earth's deep
              interior, and their successful completion  will advance the state of our
              knowledge of the Earth's core  and mantle.  An additional benefit of this
              project is that  it will help bolster scientific research in Oman, thereby 
              strengthening the quality of scientific and engineering  education with the
              Sultanate.  ***
