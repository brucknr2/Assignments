Abstract    :
                              The interests of the sexes are not always coincident, and 
              parents may not agree for at least two reasons on how to  distribute parental
              care.  Relatedness between offspring and  parents, and offspring sex may affect
              the relative  contributions of male and female care givers, as well as how 
              they invest in sons and daughters.  This study addresses the  effects of
              parentage and offspring sex on parental  provisioning in Mountain Bluebirds
              (Scialia currucoides).  Preliminary results suggest that Mountain Bluebird
              males but  not females bias their feedings toward male-biased broods.  In
              addition, male care givers appear to feed less, on  average, than female care
              givers do, suggesting that male  certainty of parentage is lower than that of
              females.  Patterns of allocation of parental care will be determined  by 1)
              observations in the field, 2) video-taping of  activities in the nest, 3)
              manipulation of number of males  and females in the nest (sex-ratio), 4)
              manipulation of  proximate factors, such as nestling postion.  Parentage will 
              be assigned using DNA fingerprinting.  Mountain Bluebirds  are particularly
              instructive in terms of the evolution of  parental care because this species is
              a member of a clade  (the genus Siala) in which the other two members show 
              opposite trends in sex-biased provisioning of offspring.
