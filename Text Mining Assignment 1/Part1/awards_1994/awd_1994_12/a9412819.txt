Abstract    :
              9412818  DeRobertis    This Americas Program award will  support travel and
              related  expenses for ten U.S. scientists and four U.S. post-doctoral  students
              to attend and participate in the " International  Workshop on Molecular Biology
              of Cell differentiation and  Embryonic Development" to be held in Santiago,
              Chile, on  January, 1995.  The students will be full participants and  present
              lectures on their work.  Partial support for four  Latin American graduate
              students is also included in this  award.  The workshop organizers are Dr.
              Edward DeRobertis,  University of California, Los Angeles, in collaboration
              with  Dr. Jorge Allende, University of  Chile.    The objective of this
              workshop is to strengthen  international scientific collaboration  in research
              and to  stimulate the interest of young scientists and students in  an area
              that has undergone dramatic advance in recent years.  The attendance of world
              leaders in the field and  representatives from outstanding Latin American
              laboratories  is likely to lead to the identification of research 
              opportunities and closer integration of efforts.    ***
