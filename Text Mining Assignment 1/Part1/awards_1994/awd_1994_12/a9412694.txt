Abstract    :
              McGinnis  9412694       Electronics assembly represents a significant component
              of  contemporary manufacturing, and a significant opportunity for  improving
              competitiveness.  The objectives of this study are to  clearly identify the key
              operating characteristics of electronic  assembly that are relevant for process
              planning, assess the  relevance of current research for the actual operating
              situations,  assess the readiness of the industry to deploy research results, 
              and identify opportunities for improving the industry/university  collaborative
              approach to developing and deploying useful research  results in this area.    
                These objectives will be met by developing an appropriate  survey instrument,
              surveying manufacturing sites and analyzing the  results of the survey in the
              light of prior experience.  The  results of this collaboration will be a
              published, public-domain  report describing the findings.
