Abstract    :
              9412152  Rapoport      The popular movement and candidacy of H. Ross Perot added
              an  historic dimension to the 1992 presidential election. By winning  19
              percent of the popular vote, Mr. Perot outdistanced all  independent candidates
              in the 20th century except Theodore  Roosevelt, who ran as a popular
              ex-president in 1912.  Perot;s  success in mobilizing thousands of activists
              and attracting  millions of votes raised questions about the health of the 
              American two-party system, and whether he would be able to  transform his
              movement into an enduring third party.    The most important and enduring
              legacy of the Perot movement will  likely be manifest through the cadre of
              activists mobilized by  his campaign.  The Perot movement will change the
              parties whether  Mr. Perot runs again for president in 1996, and whether he is 
              able to convert his movement into a third party.  The purpose of  this
              investigation is to monitor active participants in the 1992  Perot campaign as
              they encounter the 1994 congressional elections  and the 1996 presidential
              election.  By studying changes in their  attitudes, perceptions, and behavior,
              and by comparing them with  samples of activists in the two major parties, the
              investigators  will be able to track the Perot movement and its impact on the 
              two party system.
