Abstract    :
              9412292  Hanson  Dendritic  polymers (dendrimers) are a remarkable  new  class 
              of  polymers  with  highly branched structure.  This  research  deals  with 
              the  synthesis  and  characterization  of  dendrimers  with  spectroscopic 
              probes covalently built in to the structure.   The  spectroscopic studies will
              provide insight into the  polarity  of  the  probe's microenvironment at
              strategic locations  within  the  dendramers, the motion of the polymers in
              solution, the  mobility  of  branches  at various distances from the molecular 
              core,  the  acces  of  small molecules to the dendrimers' interior,  and  the 
              effective radius of the dendritic molecules.    The  experiments  will  test
              the existing theories  of  dendrimer  structure and will allow formulation of
              more accurate models  for  predicting  both  structure and dynamics.  Such an 
              understanding  should  enhance  the  prospects  for  pratical  applications  
              of  dendritic polymers.
