Abstract    :
              9412436  Hadjimichael  We plan to continue investigations in electroweak physics
              and  hadron structure, and in the framework of lepton interactions  with light
              nuclei.  One facet centers on the interpretability of  high accuracy
              experimental measurements which are now feasible,  or will soon be so, at
              several laboratories: CEBAF, MIT/Bates,  Mainz, TRIUMF, NIKHEF, and elsewhere: 
              The second facet  concentrates on electro and photo-reactions in the A+3,4
              systems,  with special emphasis on kinematical areas where correlated NN  pairs
              in the initial state in nuclei can provide information on  the nature of shell
              NN systems.  ***
