Abstract    :
                  We still have only a poor understanding of how certain nerve cells can
              signal "heat" and "cold" in the body's somatosensory system.  This process of
              thermal transduction has not been clarified for over 50 years, despite rapid
              advances in other sensory systems based on modern approaches to membrane
              physiology.  It is particularly interesting to know how thermal stimuli that do
              not cause pain, but simply thermal sensations, are processed by specialized
              nerve cells.  This work utilizes a recently developed technique with a thermal
              stimulator sufficiently small to heat a single cell, and a way to monitor and
              control rapid thermal changes at the small tip of the device to control
              temperature in a micro-environment.  The objective is to identify in
              thermosensitive cells what the molecular mechanisms are for transduction of
              innocuous thermal stimuli.  Neurophysiological methods of current-clamp and
              voltage-clamp are used on isolated cells in culture.  If this novel approach
              can identify thermally-sensitive membrane channels, it will be a major advance
              in understanding temperature sensation at the periphery, and the function of
              "free" nerve endings that have no specialized receptor organs.  This work will
              have impact on somatosensory physiology, on cellular biophysics, and on
              neuroscience, and be fundamental to understanding how animals respond to slight
              thermal changes in their environment.
