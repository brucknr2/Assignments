Abstract    :
                    The Caribbean Marine Research Center (CMRC) is one of six  National
              Undersea Research Centers.  CMRC's marine field  station on Lee Stocking Island
              (LSI) in the Exuma Cays,  Bahamas comprises 28 buildings, a 915-meter airstrip,
              nine  research vessels, wet and dry submersibles, and  recompression chamber
              and an underwater habitat.  The  station affords access to a pristine marine
              environment with  a diverse array of tropical habitats including shallow and 
              deep coral reefs, grassbeds, sand flats, mangroves,  submerged carbonate
              terraces, subsea caves, blue holes,  tidal channels and stromatolites, a unique
              bio-geological  feature.  During 1993, 131 visiting scientists and students 
              conducted research in the fields of benthic ecology,  invertebrate biology,
              fisheries ecology, oceanography, coral  reef ecology, paleo-oceanography,
              macroalgal ecology,  aquaculture, global climate change, coral bleaching and 
              marine geology.  In addition, a limited number of field  courses and workshops
              were held at LSI.  However, the  station is hindered by a paucity of
              accommodations for  visiting scientists, and the lack of a suitable lecture and
               workshop facility, which prevents CMRC from meeting numerous  requests to
              conduct field courses, workshops and research.  The proposed partnership
              between CMRC, The College of  William & Mary (W&M), and NSF would significantly
              enhanced  the utility of one of the most productivity marine field  stations in
              the Caribbean.  Specifically this project will  provide for the construction of
              a dormitory and  lecture/workshop building at LSI.  Key contributions by CMRC 
              include property for the facility, support services, and  administrative
              framework for coordination of activities, and  maintenance of the building over
              the facility's lifetime.
