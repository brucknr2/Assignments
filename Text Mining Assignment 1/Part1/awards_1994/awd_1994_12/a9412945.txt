Abstract    :
              Allen-Lohr, Susan  9412945  The Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (RMBL) is
              an  independent, nonprofit  field station with no institutional  affiliation,
              which provides facilities for researchers who  wish to study high-altitude
              biology in a field setting.  Researchers have come to the RMBL for more than
              six decades.  Recent facilities grants from the NSF have assisted with 
              construction and renovation of several buildings.  This  project will assist
              the RMBL in providing an addition to the  current research library building to
              house the various  research specimen collections (birds, insects, mammals and 
              plants) that are currently scattered around the field  station in various
              closets and offices.  The RMBL Master  Plan, completed in 1989 after five years
              of work and review,  highlights  the need for adequate research collections and
               space to utilize them.  The remodeled space will make the  collections vastly
              more useful to researchers at the RMBL.  Matching funds will provide for a
              collections curator, and  also the establishment of a geographic information
              system  and the addition of research collections data to it.
