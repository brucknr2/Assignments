Abstract    :
              This proposal is for funds to purchase Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry
              (GC/MS) equipment which will be used to upgrade the analytical system of an
              existing high temperature reactor facility.  The equipment will be used to help
              identify and measure the concentrations of the products produced in the
              incineration and thermal destruction of wastes containing chlorofluorocarbons.
