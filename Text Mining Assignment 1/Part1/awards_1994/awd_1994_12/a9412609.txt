Abstract    :
                 The proposed study seeks to study the fundamental thermo-mechanical aspects
              of the thermal removal (with and without a setter bed) of multicomponent
              binders from an injection molded specimen, i.e., the melting and evaporation of
              multicomponent binders with suspended solid particles.  The nearly consolidated
              particles remaining at the end of the thermal debinding (with a typical 15%
              reduction in the volume) can be defect free, when during debinding the internal
              gas pressure and the tensile stress of the partially liquid saturated
              non-consolidated porous medium (i.e., suspension system) do not exceed some
              threshold values. It is propose here to make an in-situ measurement of several
              thermal and mechanical (including defect formation) characteristics and to make
              visual observations to identify the phenomena, mechanisms, and regimes in
              thermal debinding of multicomponent binders in the presence (and absence) of a
              setter bed.  It is also proposed to use the experimental results to model these
              phenomena using rigorous treatment of transport, reaction, phase change, and
              stress-strain in the binder-suspended particles medium and to predict the
              transient thermo-mechanical aspects within the specimen during debinding. The
              anticipated results can contribute to the fundamentals of thermal processing of
              materials and used in the selection of the multicomponent binder and the setter
              bed according to the specimen size, shape, and properties, and for the control
              of the gaseous ambient convective temperature and velocity to prevent defect
              formation (while reducing the processing time and the energy consumed).
