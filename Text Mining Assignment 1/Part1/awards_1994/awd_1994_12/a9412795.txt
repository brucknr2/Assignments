Abstract    :
              9412795  Meech    A workshop for high school teachers and students on  the theme
              of 'Toward Other Planetary Systems'  TOPS  will be held  in Hilo, Hawaii from
              June 12-19, 1994.  The theme of exploring the  formation of planetary systems
              and the conditions for life and  intelligence in space will be used as a
              platform to introduce high  school students and teachers to areas of planetary
              science that are  pushing the limits of ground-based and space-based
              astronomical  technology.  Discussions of how astronomers are using the 
              telescopes on Mauna Kea, Hawaii and in space to search for evidence  of planet
              formation in other solar systems will:    (i) open up a new awareness of the
              forefront of astronomical  research in Hawaii and supported by NSF and     (ii)
              will provide an exciting basis for young students to consider  careers in
              astronomy and finally     (iii) will provide a wealth of new teaching materials
              to science  educators at the high school level.      One of the primary goals
              is to make the TOPS theme a means by which  new educational materials are
              introduced to high school teachers so  that they could better bring stimulating
              science into the classroom  at the ages when students are first beginning to
              think about  potential careers.  The workshop consists of lectures, equipment 
              demonstrations, science experiment demonstrations, joint and  separate
              student-teacher activities, computer demonstrations,  discussion groups about
              careers and job opportunities, a tour of  the Mauna Kea Observatory facilities,
              and a nighttime observing  session.
