Abstract    :
              9412965  This computationally intensive research will investigate the 
              relationship between structure and physical properties of nanophase  ceramics
              with multimillion particle molecular dynamics simulations  on parallel
              computers.  Synthesized by in situ consolidation of  nanometer size clusters,
              nanophase materials possess ultrafine  microstructures with a large fraction of
              atoms residing in grain  boundaries.  Nanophase ceramics display superior
              mechanical  properties and have much lower sintering temperature.  Multimillion
               particle simulations will be performed with interparticle  potentials that
              include effects of charge transfer, electronic  polarizabilities, steric
              repulsion, and covalent interactions.  The  purpose of these atomistic
              simulations will be to determine (1)  structural correlations, in particular
              the nature of defects in  nanophase ceramics; (2) kinetic roughening of
              interfaces; (3)  atomic diffusion and other dynamical processes; (4) thermal 
              properties of nanophase ceramics; and (5) mechanical properties  including
              crack propagation and fracture and the mechanism of  ductility in
              nanostructured ceramics.  %%%  The computational research will utilize a number
              of parallel  computers to determine the properties of a new class of ceramic 
              materials.  The research will involve developing new computer codes  for these
              next generation computers and carrying out sophisticated  computations.  The
              use of parallel machines and large numbers of  interacting particles will allow
              realistic simulations to be  carried out.
