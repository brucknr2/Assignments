Abstract    :
              IBN-9412115  Robert Dores    The pituitary gland is the site for synthesis of
              several polypeptide hormones which are used as chemical messenger to influence
              a variety of functions such as growth, reproduction, and chronic stress
              regulation.  One characteristic of polypeptide hormones is that the molecule
              that is first synthesized inside the cell (called a prohormone) is biologically
              inactive and must undergo a variety of processing steps by enzymes to convert
              the non-functional prohormone into a biologically active hormone.  One of these
              important prohormones is proopiomelanocortin (POMC) found in the intermediate
              pituitary.  POMC is the common prohormone for adrenocorticotropin,
              melanocyte-stimulating hormone, and the endogenous opioid, beta-endorphin. 
              After POMC is synthesized, it undergoes a number of processing steps to make
              these active hormones.  The sites inside the cell where the enzymatic reactions
              take place and the regulation and nature of the enzymes involved are poorly
              understood.  This is a proposal to study in melanotropic cells of the anuran
              amphibian, Bufo marinus, the subcellular coordination of two important enzymes
              (prohormone convertase 1 and 2) that are involved in the processing and the
              location inside the cell where this processing occurs.  Since the proper
              synthesis of pituitary hormones is essential to the survival of all
              vertebrates, these studies are critical for providing new insights into the
              cell biology of pituitary cells.
