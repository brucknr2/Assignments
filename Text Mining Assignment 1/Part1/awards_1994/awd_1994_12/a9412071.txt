Abstract    :
              9412071  Murphy  This equipment grant requests funds for an automatic six
              degree-  of-freedom ultrasound scanning system to be assembled in the 
              Mechanical Engineering Department at Louisiana State University.  In situ,
              nondestructive measurement of the geometry of biological  surfaces, including
              skin, skeletal, cartilage, and subchondral  bone, will be possible with
              resolution on the order of 10-20  micrometers with the proposed system.  This
              level of resolution  is essential for developing mathematical models of the
              kinematics  and dynamics of human joints.  In the typical joint, short stiff 
              ligaments and articular surfaces act as passive constraints,  complementing the
              active constraint and control of the muscle  system.  Ligament elongations are
              thought to be on the order of  one millimeter in normal movements of the knee
              joints and  significantly less in finger joints.  Thus surface geometry must 
              be measured with high accuracy in order to develop meaningful  mathematical
              models of passive constraint behavior of the  articular surfaces and ligaments
              which form parallel systems.  ***
