Abstract    :
              Dr. Dietrich is examining the life of one of the most controversial  and
              enigmatic figures in twentieth century biology, Richard B.  Goldschmidt. Known
              now for his heretical denial of gradual  evolution and the existence of the
              gene, in his time Goldschmidt  was controversial but recognized as one of the
              top biologists in  Germany and later in the United States.  Dr. Dietrich is
              examining  the development of Goldschmidt's scientific thought, the impact of 
              his forced immigration to a radically different institutional  setting in the
              United States, and the creation and perpetuation of  his status as a heretic.
              This project promises to contribute  significantly to the history of biology in
              the twentieth century by  clarifying important issues concerning styles of
              scientific  practice, the dynamics of scientific controversy, and the uses of 
              history in scientific rhetoric.
