Abstract    :
              WAKEHAM/FREEMAN  9401765/9412739        The relationship between  CO2(aq)  and
              the fractionation of carbon  isotopes during carbon fixation in the ocean plays
              a major role in  preserving climatically-drive isotopic signatures in
              sediments. It  is known that the fractionation of carbon isotopes during 
              photosynthesis is dependent on a number of factors, including   CO2(aq) ,
              nutrient concentrations, temperature, rate of primary  production, and species
              composition.  Sedimentation of partculate  matter in the ocean then transfers
              part of this isotopic signal to  the sediments, where the isotopic signal may
              be used as a proxy for  inferring past environmental conditions.  Factors which
              determine  the photosynthetic isotope fractionation (ep) will be examined in 
              the context of the hypothesis that there is no generally applicable 
              relationship between  CO2(aq)  and ep. Rather, regional  environmental
              conditions are critical control and different  molecular biomarkers may record
              a variety of ep -  CO2(aq)   relationships.  Three markedly different
              environments will be used  in the study 1) the North Atlantic between the Gulf
              of Maine and  the Sargasso Sea; 2) the equatorial Pacific between 12 degree N
              and  12 degress S at 140 degree W; and 3) the Peru upwelling area.  Isotopic
              compositions of selected biomarkers will be interpreted  using synoptic
              measurements of temperature,  CO2(aq) , segma13C  DIC, nutrients and
              photoplankton species composition. The  information will make it possible to
              reconstruct the  paleoenvironmental record in marine sediments and will provide
              a  basis for future assessments of ocean-climate relationships using  combined
              biomarker and isotope techniques.
