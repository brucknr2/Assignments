Abstract    :
              9412471  Wang       The main objective of this project is to develop a 
              comprehensive control design method for automotive powertrain  systems.  The
              project will start with the generic modelling of  automotive powertrain systems
              such that the models developed can  be tuned to describe many typical
              powertrain systems in  automobiles.  In particular, we will develop a modelling
              strategy  which exploits and extends the existing models obtained from  physics
              and static data fitting of powertrain components to  derive control-oriented
              dynamic models of integrated powertrain  systems.        The project will be of
              practical importance in providing  constructive design tools for better
              powertrain control and  performance, which is a central concern for producing
              better cars  at lower cost to maintain the competitiveness of the U.S. 
              automotive industry in the international market.  ***
