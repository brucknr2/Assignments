Abstract    :
              9412816  Abstract  The bacterium E. coli provides a good model system for the
              study of  genetic recombination.  The ease with which it is maintained and 
              genetically manipulated has allowed the isolation and analysis of  a large
              number of recombination deficient mutants and the  subsequent identification
              and analysis of the genes and respective  gene products.  Many of the genes
              involved in homologous  recombination are also required for some aspect of DNA
              repair.   There are at least three distinct recombination pathways termed 
              RecBCD, RecE, and RecF which differ from each other with respect to  the gene
              product(s) required.  Both the RecBCD and RecF pathways  function in wild type
              cells, and both are believed to require the  recA gene product.  At least
              twelve additional recombination genes  are involved in some aspect of RecF
              pathway recombination, yet very  little is known about the interaction between
              the RecF pathway gene  products and how they function together in
              recombination.  All RecF  pathway mediated recombination requires the recO and
              recR gene  products.  In addition, both gene products are essential for DNA 
              repair following UV irradiation or mitomycin C exposure.  Purified  RecO
              protein shares some biochemical activities with RecA protein  including D-loop
              formation, and RecO can substitute for RecA in  vivo, suggesting that the two
              proteins are functionally similar.   The goal of this research is to further
              investigate the function of  RecO protein in vivo, and to identify and
              characterize the  biochemical properties associated with RecO in vitro that are
               relevant to RecO function in recombination and DNA repair.  ***  One aspect of
              DNA metabolism that is not well characterized at the  molecular level is
              general recombination.  Recombination mechanisms  are essential to generate
              genetic diversity, to maintain cell  viability after DNA damage, and to
              accurately segregate chromosomes  during meiosis.  %%%
