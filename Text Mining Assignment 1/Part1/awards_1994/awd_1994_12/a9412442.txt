Abstract    :
              9412442  Imperiali  The focus of this research is the assembly of "compact" 
              supersecondary structural motifs of 20-40 amino acids in length  for the de
              novo synthesis of proteins.  Specific targets  include a triple-stranded
              antiparallel beta-sheet motif,  structurally based on a domain excised from the
              homologous  family of alpha-neurotoxins, and alpha,beta,beta and beta, 
              alpha,alpha motifs patterned after the scorpion toxins and zinc  finger
              proteins respectively.  The studies will evaluate the  potential for using
              tailored motifs for the preparation of  templates, useful in turn, for the
              costruction of catalysts.  %%%  With this renewal award, the Synthetic Organic
              Program is  supporting the research of Dr. Barbara Imperiali of the  Division
              of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering at the  California Institute of
              Technology.  Professor Imperiali will  focus her work on understanding and
              manipulating polypeptide  architecture.  The work will involve the assembly of 
              structurally defined polypeptide motifs that can be used as  versatile three
              dimensional templates for the construction of  catalytically active entities.
