Abstract    :
                    This  is  an award under the Grants for Improving  Doctoral  Dissertation 
              Research  program.  It is a  study  of  changes  in  ethnic identification
              among white ethnic groups and the impact of  such  identification on the labor
              force participation  of  women.  Census  data  from the 1910, 1940, 1950, 1970,
              and 1980  censuses  will  be  used,  with  a focus on English, Italian, 
              Polish,  and  Jewish  women.   Census data from 137 different  American  cities
               will  be  examined through time to see how features of the  local  economy 
              and  population  composition  affect  the  labor   force  participation of
              women in the chosen ethnic groups.        Previous  research has viewed the
              ethnic identification  of  immigrants  as  gradually  receding  as  a  result 
              of  prolonged  exposure  to the American melting pot.  More recently
              researchers  have  recognized that ethnic identification and distinctive forms 
              of  behavior  associated with that identification can  be  either  strengthened
               or weakened, depending upon features of  the  local  social  structure in
              which members of a group live.  Yet to  date  few  studies  have  rigorously
              investigated  how  this  "emergent  ethnicity"  works,  and by doing so, this
              project  will  make  an  important contribution.  In addition to the scientific
               gains  to  be achieved by the research, this award will materially assist  a 
              highly  promising student in completing research  for  the  Ph.D. 
              dissertation.   Thus  it  contributes to  the  future  scientific  manpower  of
               the nation and the thorough training  of  the  next  generation of social
              scientists.
