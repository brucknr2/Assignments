Abstract    :
              9412049  McCullouch  The researchers will use the equipment to demonstrate to
              the  construction industry how the developing technology of multimedia  can be
              utilized to significantly improve certain functions of the  construction
              process and thereby bring benefits which should  stimulate research and
              development.  The multimedia equipment  requested will be used to support
              research on several projects.  The equipment will allow the researchers to
              position the school  for research activities that can utilize the promising
              technology  of multimedia and apply it to a major industry, construction.  ***
