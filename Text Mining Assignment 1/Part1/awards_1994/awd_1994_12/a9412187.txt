Abstract    :
              9412187  Nicol    The objective of this proposed work is to measure properties
              of  materials at moderately high pressures to tens of gigapascals  (GPa) with
              sufficient precision to test the accuracy of  theoretical models and translate
              the understanding into new  materials. Specific areas of research outlined in
              the proposal  include: (1) characterizing the photochemistry, chemistry and 
              phase diagram of sulfur to approximately 20 GPa; (2) developing  x-ray
              diffraction techniques at the Stanford Synchrotron  Radiation Laboratory (SSRL)
              for high temperature-high pressure  techniques; (3) determining crystal
              structures and sound speeds  to 20 GPa and 1000 degrees kelvin for the same
              oriented oxide  crystal and structures for oxygen, sulfur, and nitroanilines;
              (4)  defining intra-and inter-molecular perturbations on the  structures and
              stabilities of nitroanilines and nitroaromatics  related to energetic materials
              and (5) determining the  conditions, mechanisms and products of reactions which
              limit the  stabilities of unsaturated carbon compounds in the 5-15 GPa  range. 
                %%%    The goal of this proposed study is to explore the high-pressure 
              synthesis of novel materials. These fundamental chemistry and  physics studies
              under high pressure, to include vibrational  dynamics, energetics and
              structures of condensed-phase systems,  will lead to materials developments in
              areas of technological  interest such as energetic materials, polymers, and
              molecular  materials such as diamond and fullerenes.
