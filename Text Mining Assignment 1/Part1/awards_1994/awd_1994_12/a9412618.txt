Abstract    :
                9412618  Bloomfield    The objective of the program is to develop an atomic
              and molecular  viewpoint for electronic ordering in solids through the study of
               atomic clusters.  By examining the electronic and magnetic  properties of
              clusters of atoms from two to five hundred atoms  using beam and
              photodetachment techniques, it is possible to  examine the transition from
              simple atomic behavior to that observed  in bulk solids.    % % %    This
              project seeks an atomic and molecular picture for electronic  ordering in
              solids through the study of atomic clusters.  As they  evolve in size from 2 to
              500 atoms, clusters of atoms make a  transition from molecules to small solids
              or liquids.  By studying  the development of magnetic and electronic properties
              in small  particles, the research will improve the understanding of the 
              relationship between atoms, molecules, and condensed matter.  Such  studies
              will provide understanding of the molecular origins of  metallic and
              nonmetallic behaviors as well as metal-nonmetal  transitions.  ***
