Abstract    :
              9412742  Kamari       The Rapid Response Manufacturing (RRM) program is an
              effort    for the development of a knowledge-intensive environment in which  
              engineers can design and manufacture parts faster and cheaper, with  
              acceptable levels of quality, and deliver the manufactured products   to
              customers in response to their demands.  The main objective of   this research
              is the development of a Group Technology Knowledge-   Based Coding and
              Classification system and its complementary    database to support the
              activities within the RRM environment for   a specific product, an automobile
              crankshaft.       The technical concepts associated with the development of
              this   environment include feature-based products modeling, knowledge-    based
              environments, and database systems.
