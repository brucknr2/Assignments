Abstract    :
              9412028  Simenstad    This project will continue and expand upon a previous four
               year NSF Land-Margin Ecosystem Research (LMER) study (1990-  1994) of the
              importance of estruarine turbidity maxima (ETM)  to river estuaries and coastal
              ecosystems, as exemplified by  the Columbia River estuary. In these continuing 
              investigations , the project will build on past results and  will concentrate
              the research on five areas:         * particle aggregation/disaggregation as a
              key linkage  between ETM physics,             geochemistry and ecology;       *
              biogeochemical and ecological processes affected by  ETM dynamics;       *
              modeling of these proecesses to quantify mass,  constituent and energy fluxes, 
                           and chemical  transformations,  with respect to selected scenarios
              of  watershed and global climate change;       * interactions of ETM with
              surrounding estuarine  habitats, watershed and the             coastal ocean;  
                  * selected comparisons with other estuaries,  particularly LMER sites.   
              The Columbia River estuary is characteristic of a major  class of land-margin
              ecosystmes (river estuaries) and  differs in many respects from other LMER
              sites. Because of  its distinctiveness and scale, and the importance of large 
              river estuaries to coastal oceans, comparisons of critical  processes and
              properties in the Columbia River estuary with  those of LMER sites and selected
              oterh estuaries will  contribut significantly to understanding global
              variability  in land-margin systems and their responses to anthropogenic 
              inputs and changes. Comparative efforts will focus on  analysis of particle
              dynamics, microbial-loop processes, and  trophic transfers across LMER systems.
              Results of these  comparisons will be embedded in an estuarine classificiation 
              system that ecnompasses physical, sedimentological and  geochemical aspects of
              temperate estuaries.  ***
