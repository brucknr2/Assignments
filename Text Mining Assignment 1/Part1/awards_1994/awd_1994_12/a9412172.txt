Abstract    :
              9412172  Williams  A vertically scanning interference microscope will support 
              research on the tribological processes occurring in mechanical  end face seals.
               Its primary use will be as a full-field  topographical measuring device to
              fully characterize the  conditions of mating seal surfaces of different
              materials and  operating under different condition.  ***
