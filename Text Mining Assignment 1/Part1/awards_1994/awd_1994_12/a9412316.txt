Abstract    :
              9412316  HIRSCHI  This project uses a survey of adolescents to develop better 
              measures of self-control and to test control theories of  delinquency and
              crime.  These theories, which suggest that young  people commit delinquent acts
              because they do not consider the long  term or broader consequences of their
              acts, have received  significant scientific support.  They argue that child
              rearing  practices in the home and the school produce people with varying 
              degrees of concern for family, school, and peers, which translates  into a
              differential likelihood of committing delinquent or criminal  acts.  Major
              scientific issues remain, however, which center on the  generalizability of
              such patterns, on the circularity or  tautological nature of individual-level
              control theories, on the  relation between social and individual sources of
              control, and on  the relation between control theory and other forms of
              deterrence  (such as activities of the criminal justice system).      The
              research will (1) test the generalizability of earlier work to  samples
              differing in ethnicity, gender, urban location, and  historical period; (2)
              develop and validate measures of self-  control; (3) analyze the relationship
              between social-control and  self-control; and (4) explore the relationship
              between these forms  of control and other types of deterrence.  The study will
              produce  an empirically validated instrument for measuring self-control and  a
              large data set of high quality that will be of interest to many  researchers.
