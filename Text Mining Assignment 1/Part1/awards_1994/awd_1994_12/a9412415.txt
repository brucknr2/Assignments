Abstract    :
              The  focus  of  this  research is on the  design,  analysis,  and 
              implementation  of  efficient algorithms and paradigms  to  solve  problems in
              image analysis and computational geometry on parallel  computers.  
              Specifically,  algorithms  are  considered   for   a  scalable model of
              computation that provides a reliable metric  in  terms  of  a  comparison of
              running times between  algorithms  on  commercially  available  medium-grained
              parallel  machines.   The  algorithms  typically  combine efficient parallel 
              data  movement  operations,  paradigms,  and  data  reduction  techniques,  
              with  efficient  sequential  algorithms.   The  concentration   is   on 
              problems  with  applications to robotics  and  image  processing,  including 
              those  involving connectivity,  convexity,  proximity,  area, intersection, and
              minimal-area enclosing polygons, to  name  a  few.  The experimental component
              of the research includes  the  porting,  optimization, and evaluation of a
              large system designed  to  solve an important problem in x-ray crystallography,
               over  a  wide variety of multiprocessor platforms.
