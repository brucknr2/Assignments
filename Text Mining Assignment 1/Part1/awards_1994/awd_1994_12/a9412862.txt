Abstract    :
              9412862  Vahala  A series of systems level experiments of wide-band, lossless,
              wavelength converters shall be carried out.  These wavelength converters are
              based on the principles of four wave mixing in quantum well traveling-wave
              amplifiers.  The experiments planned include a measurement of the intensity
              noise introduced into the converted signal by the conversion process, a single
              channel system measurement testing the effect of the converter on bit error
              rate (BER), a two channel measurement to study potential channel cross-talk
              effects caused by the conversion process, and a feasibility test of
              semiconductor TWA wavelength converters for dispersion compensation by way of
              the spectral inversion technique.  In addition, mixed-strain amplifiers will be
              investigated as polarization independent converters.  The amplifiers used in
              this project will be supplied at no charge by AT&T Bell Laboratories.  In
              addition, a 500MB/sec bit error rate tester will be donated to the project b
              AT&T Bell Laboratories  (see letter in proposal).  ***
