Abstract    :
                9412536  Malin  This award, jointly funded by the International and the
              Chemistry  Divisions of NSF, will support a program of Summer Research 
              Fellowships.  Organized by the American Chemical Society (ACS),   the program
              will be under the supervision of Dr. John Malin of  the ACS and Prof. Ernest
              Eliel of the University of North  Carolina at Chapel Hill.  Through these
              summer fellowships, Latin  American chemistry faculty, at the start of their
              research  careers, will be invited to spend two months on mutually-designed 
              projects at U.S. institutions.    The program will be coordinated with the
              chemical societies and  scientific academies of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and
              Mexico,  with cost sharing from the research agencies of these countries.  
              Each of the national chemical societies will recommend up to four  candidates
              per year; approximately six will be chosen by an ACS  panel, with at least one
              participant from each country per year  of the program.  This support will help
              to develop and strengthen  cooperative research in the chemical sciences by
              fostering  strong, new, and early interactions between U.S. and Latin  American
              researchers.  ***
