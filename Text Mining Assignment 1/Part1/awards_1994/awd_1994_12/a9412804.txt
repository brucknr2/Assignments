Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry   Division,
              Lindsay and Lombardi are conducting resonance Raman studies on   mass-selected
              metal clusters in rare gas matrices.  Sputter-produced   metal cluster cations
              are mass selected and co-deposited  with excess   rare gas on a window in the
              presence of low energy electrons.    Neutralized cluster samples of mixed metal
              species and a variety of   transition metal elements are interrogated by
              several different   spectroscopic techniques.  Vibrational constants will be
              obtained under   conditions where there is little or no ambiguity as to the
              spectral   carrier.   Force constants, bond energies, and geometries of the
              clusters   will be obtained from the data.  %%%  Atoms and macroscopic bulk
              material are two extremes of matter which are   fairly well understood.  Small
              atomic or molecular clusters represent the   transition between these two
              states of matter.  Scientists are interested   in knowing more about clusters
              in order to learn more about quantum   effects and bulk properties in matter. 
              The results of these studies will   help understand some of these issues and
              will also provide structural   information which permits an understanding of
              the bonding properties of   small metal clusters as a function of the position
              of the elements in the   periodic table.
