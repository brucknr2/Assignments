Abstract    :
              9412925  Kaid  Concerns about ethical abuses in televised political advertising 
              have grown substantially as a result of developing video  technology.  This
              project will inventory and quantify types of  ethical abuses involving
              technology in televised political ads.   The project will emphasize content
              analysis methods to inventory  and quantify types of technological abuses.  The
              project will also  use experimental methods for a preliminary testing of
              whether such  technological distortions affect voter judgments of political 
              candidates.  The findings of the project will provide researchers,  policy
              makers and political and media professionals with a better  understanding of
              the ways in which technology can affect the  American democratic process.  A
              pilot project has found that  sixteen percent of sampled political spots from
              1952-1992 contain  ethically-suspect uses of technology, and that such
              distortions  occur more frequently in negative ads.  Results from this project 
              will be disseminated in traditional ways (journal articles and  professional
              convention presentations).  A videotape discussing the  problem of political
              ethics and video technology, providing samples  of misleading technological
              applications, will also be produced.  ***
