                     The ability to rapidly shift attention is an essential  aspect of
              adaptive behavior.  Different types of attentional  shifts are well known in
              humans.  One type involves shifting  attention between different levels of the
              environment.  For  example, one can look at a landscape and see the forest or 
              see the trees.  Another type involves shifting attention  between novel and
              familiar stimuli.  Dr. Shimp is working to  develop innovative new procedures
              for the study of these  attentional phenomena in animals.  These new procedures
              will  lead to new information about the mechanisms underlying  attentional
              shifts and will allow techniques from behavioral  neuroscience to be brought to
              bear on their biological  bases.
