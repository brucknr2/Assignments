Abstract    :
              9412787  Koen    During a four month research visit to Japan,  Professor Koen
              will work with Professor  Yasutaka Shimizu, Director of the Center for 
              Research and Development of Educational  Technology (CRADLE), Tokyo Institute
              of  Technology, to investigate the use of  engineering heuristics in
              engineering design  and engineering design education in Japan.  An  heuristic
              is defined as anything that provides  a plausible aid or direction in the
              solution of  a problem but is in the final analysis  unjustified, incapable of
              justification, and  potentially fallible.  A convenient, informal  near-synonym
              for heuristic is the engineering  concept of rule-of-thumb.    Japanese
              engineers are among the most effective  in the world.  This project seeks to
              validate  the use of heuristics in Japan, to evaluate the  acceptance and
              recognition of heuristics in  that country, to find examples of heuristics 
              used in engineering design in Japan, to  determine the ease of discovering
              heuristics in  a different culture and, finally, to  demonstrate the use of
              design heuristics in a  course of artificial intelligence.  The results  of
              this research have the potential for  radically changing the way engineering
              design  is taught and practiced.  ***
