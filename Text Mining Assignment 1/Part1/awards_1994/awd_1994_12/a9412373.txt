Abstract    :
              Dr. Eisberg is examining the life of the astronomer, Beatrice  Tinsley
              (1941-1981).  Despite her short career, Tinsley is  significant to both the
              intellectual and the social history of  science.  Tinsley's career exemplifies
              many of the most striking  difficulties encountered by female scientists. 
              Nevertheless, she  played a central role in originating the modern study of the
               evolution of stellar populations and galaxies, now among the most  active
              fields of astronomy, and a field with crucial links to  cosmology.    Dr.
              Eisberg's study promises to place Tinsley's scientific work in  context of the
              history of stellar and galactic astrophysics and  cosmology as well as the
              history of women in science.  She has  access to Tinsley's large collection of
              scientific papers and  family correspondence.  She is also able to conduct
              interviews with  many of Tinsley's surviving colleagues.  This study will allow
              Dr.  Eisberg to explore gender differences in the practice of science as  well
              as the social and intellectual history of astronomy.  Thus, it  promises to
              have significance not just for STS scholars, but also  astronomers and those
              interested in the advance of women in  science.
