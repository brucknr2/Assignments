Abstract    :
              9412256  Doak     This study examines the effects of habitat heterogeneity,
              spatial variability, and generalist predators on the structure of the arthropod
              communty on rice plants in the Sacramento Valley, California.  The research
              employs large-scale manipulations (winter flooded vs. unflooded and organically
              managed vs. conventionally managed) and small-scale field experiments to assess
              the importance of particular species interactions in determining community
              structure.  Path analysis will allow generation and testing of predictions
              about directions and strengths of interactions.      This research will improve
              our understanding of the factors that control the structure of arthropod
              communities.  The results of this study will have direct application to
              agriculture, especially in assessing the advantages and disadvanteges of
              organic farming practices and in rice pest control.
