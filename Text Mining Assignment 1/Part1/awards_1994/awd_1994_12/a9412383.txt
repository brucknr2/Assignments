Abstract    :
              9412383  Huang  This research will further explore the rich and potentially 
              fruitful interplay between number theory and algebraic geometry  to          
              investigate computational problems in number theory,  with emphasis on:
              discrete logarithms over various  groups, which is a fundamental problem of
              cryptographic  significance; polynomial congruences modulo primes,  including
              the univariate and multivariate cases;              and  finding small
              nonresidues in finite fields;           develop efficient algorithms for
              computing with curves  over finite fields, with emphasis on fundamental 
              arithmetical problems on curves which are important for  applications in
              computational number theory,  cryptography and coding theory;           apply
              the results obtained to public-key cryptography,  coding theory, and other
              areas as well.  ***
