Abstract    :
              9412224  Rundel   The structure and dynamics of riparian ecosystems in the
              chaparral region of Southern California have not been studied in any detail. 
              Trees and woody shrubs are the dominant component of plant cover in these
              ecosystems, but a high diversity of herbaceous riparian species are also
              present.  The recent extensive fires in Southern California heavily impacted
              this reparian zone over large areas, with both direct effects on plant cover
              and woody debris and longer term effects on debris flow and runoff.  This
              proposal investigates a series of hypothesis relating chaparral fire to: 1)
              changes in woody debris and consequent impacts on sediment flow; 2) mortality
              of riparian trees; 3) seedling establishment for riparian trees; and, 4)
              nutrient loss and movement through riparian systems.
