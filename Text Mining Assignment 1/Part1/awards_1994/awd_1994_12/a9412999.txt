Abstract    :
              9412999  Hartley    This project connects Mendocino College to NSFNET over a
              56,000  bits per second line.  Faculty and students at the school benefit  from
              access to the resources of the Internet, including libraries  and
              supercomputers.  In addition, they are able to communicate and  collaborate
              with colleagues at other institutions in pursuit of  research and educational
              projects.  The award provides partial  support of the project for two years.
