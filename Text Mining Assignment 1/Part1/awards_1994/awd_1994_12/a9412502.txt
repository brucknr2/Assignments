Abstract    :
              9412502  Georgiou  This project is on research to  develop new strategies for
              the  production of catalytic antibodies.   The strategies are based on the 
              expression of a vast number of  different antibodies on the E. coli  cell
              surface followed by screening  procedures for selecting the  desired molecules
              from the  population.  The selection process  will make use of the possible 
              binding between the fluorescently  labeled conjugate of the transition  state
              analog and the antibody on  the cell surface.  Cells bound to  the transition
              state analog can  then be selected by fluorescent  activated cell sorting
              (FACS).  In  a parallel study, this research  will attempt to demonstrate the 
              isolation of catalytic antibodies  directly based on the rate of  product
              formation rather than  binding to transition state  analogs.  Catalytic
              antibodies have  a high degree of selectivity and  activity, but are currently 
              prohibitively expensive for  commercial purposes because of the  high cost of
              isolation and  production.  Part of this project  is on new approaches to lower
              this  cost.  ***
