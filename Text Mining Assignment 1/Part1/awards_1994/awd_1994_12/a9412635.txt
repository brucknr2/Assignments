Abstract    :
              9412635  Beale       The award would enable the Principal Investigator to
              undertake  projects in the general area of machine design and maintenance as 
              it relates to textile machines used for knitting, weaving and  textile
              processing.  Specific efforts to be undertaken include  finite element modeling
              of machine components, control system  optimization of textile processing
              machinery, kinematic synthesis  of textile mechanisms, and application of smart
              material  technology.  Design improvements to the loom would also be 
              considered, involving the use of braiding principles in order to  achieve
              improvements in the production rate.       The design improvements have the
              potential to achieve an order  of magnitude improvement in production rate in
              the intensively  competitive of textile manufacturing.  The interaction between
              the  Principal Investigator and the textile manufacturer would also be 
              mutually beneficial to both parties involved.  The former would  benefit from
              its impact on his teaching and research activities,  whereas the latter would
              benefit from exposure to advanced  technology.
