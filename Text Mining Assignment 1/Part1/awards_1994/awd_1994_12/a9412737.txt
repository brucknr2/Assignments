Abstract    :
              9412737  Cramer  This project is on research to  study the design of low
              molecular  weight displacers for the  simultaneous concentration and 
              purification of proteins by  displacement chromatography, and  will focus on
              the relationships  between displacer chemistry and  efficacy for protein
              displacement.   Included in this project are  experiments with defined protein 
              mixtures to examine the effects of  the polymer synthesis of displacers  on
              dynamic affinity.  The effects  of induced salt gradients on the  ability to
              concentrate will also be  studied.  A major issue will be to  determine how to
              design for  sufficient affinity while not  producing inordinately high induced 
              salt gradients.  Also, operational  issues such as ease of removal from 
              contaminated zones and column  regeneration will be examined.   Finally,
              experiments will test the  ability of the displacers developed  in this
              research to purify proteins  from complex biological mixtures.   The long term
              goal is to facilitate  the implementation of this new  technology for
              industrial  bioseparations.  ***
