Abstract    :
              9412262  THOMPSON       Ice cores drawn from glaciers provide an important
              source of  information about changes in climate, vegetation, and other 
              phenomena over tens of thousands of years.  Analyses of oxygen  isotopes can
              generate proxies for temperature, and analyses of  soluble and insoluble
              aerosols can provide indications of wind  strength and direction, volcanic
              activity, and drought.  Measurement of the thickness of annual ice layers yield
              valuable  information about precipitation patterns.  Pollen contained  within
              ice cores has not been studied as extensively, but these  fine particles offer
              great potential as sources of information  about past patterns of vegetation. 
              This collaborative research  project will extract a long-term pollen record
              with a high  temporal resolution from ice cores extracted from the Dunde Ice 
              Cap in western China.  This pollen record will supplement other  climate proxy
              data to provide a detailed regional history of  changes in the climate and
              related variables over the last  100,000 years.  Special emphasis will be
              placed on the use of  these data to examine vegetational responses to monsoon 
              circulation changes induced by changes in the Earth's orbit.  Analyses also
              will be undertaken to consider vegetational  responses to cooling during the
              "Little Ice Age" and to  greenhouse gas-induced warming during the late
              Pleistocene and  Holocene periods.       This project will provide valuable new
              data to facilitate  the reconstruction and analyses of climatic changes over
              the last  100,000 years.  Because subtropical glaciers like the Dunde Ice  Cap
              contain far more pollen than do glaciers at higher latitudes,  they permit
              examinations with relatively great temporal precision  of changing patterns of
              climate and vegetation.  They also  provide valuable sources of data regarding
              current rates of  change, and these data can be used to help validate a number
              of  different climatic models.  ***
