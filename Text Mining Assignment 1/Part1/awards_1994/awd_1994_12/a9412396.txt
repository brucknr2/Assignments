Abstract    :
              Karl Pearson was in many ways the founder of modern statistics as a set of
              methods applicable to quantitative data from almost any science.  While there
              is good historical literature about Pearson's own development as a statistician
              and the relation of his work to his eugenic commitments, there is remarkably
              little about the spread of Pearsonian statistical methods to the sciences that
              adopted them.  Dr. Porter is emphasizing the expansion of statistics through a
              study of Pearson personal contacts and correspondence.  Pearson's biometric
              laboratory began taking in postgraduate students and other visitors.  Some of
              the most important statisticians in several disciplines worked with him
              directly for extended periods.  To see how this network spread from Pearson's
              lab to the various scientific disciplines, Dr. Porter is examining both the
              Pearson archive and the published record of those who introduced modern
              statistical methods to their disciplines.  Dr. Porter is keenly alert to the
              scientific and institutional contexts within which such people worked.     
              This study contributes not only to the history of statistics as such, but also
              to our understanding of the expectations, standards, and values that have made
              statistical rules of inference so central to the drive for objectivity in the
              modern social and natural sciences.
