Abstract    :
                  9412104  Naganathan  This Research Equipment Grant will make it possible for
              the  Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Toledo to 
              purchase a UNIX based computing and graphics platform.  The  requested
              computing equipment will support ongoing NSF supported  research on
              piezoceramic materials as actuators.  The equipment  will be housed in the
              Smart Materials and Systems Laboratory and  will also be used by other faculty
              and students in the College of  Engineering for several other research
              projects.  This equipment  will significantly contribute to furthering the
              objectives of these  research projects.  ***
