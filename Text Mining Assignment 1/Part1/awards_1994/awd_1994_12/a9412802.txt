Abstract    :
              9412802  Hryciw  This project concerns the collection of perishable geotechnical
               data resulting from the January 17, 1994, Northridge, CA,  earthquake. 
              Specifically, it involves the collection of soil  liquefaction (ground failure)
              data at four locations: Simi  Valley, Santa Monica, Redondo Beach and the Lower
              Van Norman Dam;  as well as conducting preliminary Cone Penetration Tests
              (CPT),  Flat Plate Dilatometer Tests (DMT) and seismic shear wave  profiling at
              each of these sites.    It is part of the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction
              Program  investigation into the causes and effects of the Northridge 
              earthquake.  ***
