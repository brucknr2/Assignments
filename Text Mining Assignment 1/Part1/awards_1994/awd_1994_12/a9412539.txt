Abstract    :
              Tinsley/University of Texas  Project Summary         This SGER project will
              analyze data on changes in distribution  of current density in the global
              electric circuit, in relationship  to solar wind modulation of particle fluxes
              that affect the global  distribution of atmospheric conductivity.  Successfully
               demonstrating the reality of solar wind/weather/climate relations  could lead
              to improvements in long range forecasting and reduce the  uncertainty in
              evaluating the effects for global change of the  increasing amounts of
              greenhouse gases.
