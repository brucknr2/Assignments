Abstract    :
              IBN-9412699  Willis Samson    The best way to assess the physiological role of a
              neuropeptide hormone in an intact animal is to remove that neuropeptide from
              the system and observe the effect on the physiology of the animal. This study
              involves the use of a novel method, developed by this investigator, in which
              the cytotoxin plant lectin, ricin A chain, is conjugated to the hormone
              oxytocin. Using this technique the effects of oxytocin on the regulation of
              reproductive hormones will be studied. One very important part of the study
              will be to demonstrate the ability of ligand-ricin conjugates to kill specific
              receptor-bearing neuronal populations in vivo. Previous studies by this group
              have shown that intracerebroventricular injections of oxytocin-ricin A locked
              the secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) during the estrus cycle. In this
              study, the in vivo mechanism of action of oxytocin (OT)-ricin A chain in
              disrupting luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion in the estrogen and
              progesterone-primed ovariectomized rat will be determined. The goal is to
              examine possible direct communications of oxytocin-containing cells with
              containing LH releasing hormone and, more generally, to examine the roles of
              peptide hormones in the central nervous system control of reproductive
              function.
