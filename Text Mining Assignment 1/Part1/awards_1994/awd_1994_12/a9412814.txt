Abstract    :
              The Organic Dynamics program will fund the research of Professor Tanko at  
              Virginia Polytechnic Institute to develop an unambiguous and simple  
              experimental method which can be used to assess the importance of single  
              electron transfer (SET) pathways in which nucleophiles react with   carbonyl
              groups.  Specific substrates which undergo rapid irreversible   rearrangement
              upon one-electron reduction will be constructed and used as   radical anion
              clocks to measure the temporal behavior of events   associated with SET in a
              selected group of organic reactions. The   significance of this research is
              that it addresses fundamental issues of   the reactivity of oganic compounds 
              and will lead to a  better   understanding of how radical anions can be
              exploited in synthetic organic   methodology.    This research will design and
              use certain carbon compounds whose   architecture causes them to behave as a
              type of internal  molecular clock   which can monitor the way  electrons behave
              at the molecular level when   certain organic compounds react.  Increased 
              understanding about the   timing of events at the molecular level will have
              important consequences   for the production of new drugs and chemicals of
              commercial importance
