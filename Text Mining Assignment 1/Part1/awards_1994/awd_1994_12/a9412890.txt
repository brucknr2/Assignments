Abstract    :
              9412890 Lowrey   This workshop will address high-performance computing in
              participating media radiative heat transfer.  Experts form the fields of
              radiative heat transfer and high-performance computing will be brought together
              to discuss and identify opportunities for exploiting the advantages of
              high-performance computing for solving radiative heat transfer problems that
              are otherwise intractable.  The goal is to: (1) educate participants from the
              radiative heat transfer community about the opportunities of high-performance
              computing; (2) educate the participants from the  high-performance computing
              environment about the unique and demanding aspects of radiative heat transfer;
              and (3) provide a vehicle for the participants to explore interdisciplinary
              development in transport modeling, computational algorithms and hardware
              strategies that will enable a significant improvement in the ability to
              accurately and efficiently simulate complex radiative heat transfer.  There
              will be approximately 35 participants.  The workshop will be held at the
              Doubletree Hotel, Albuquerque, New Mexico, March 29-30, 1994.  The findings and
              recommendations regarding new research directions and funding needs will be
              documented in a workshop proceedings.  Copies will be widely distributed among
              all  major research entities, funding agencies, and targeted industries in the
              country.  A summary of the results will be presented at the 6th AIAA/ASME
              Thermophysics and Heat Transfer Conference and the 10th International Heat
              Transfer Conference.  The results will be placed on national electronic
              information networks.
