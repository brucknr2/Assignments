Abstract    :
              9412238  Owen  Auburn University requests support from NSF for connection of 
              five universities and colleges including: Birmingham-Southern  College, Judson
              College, Huntingdon College, Stillman College,  and Talledega College to the
              NSFNET.  This connection is a basic  part of an overall teaching improvement
              project described below.   The accessibility of the network to all the schools
              is critical  for the coordination of that project and accomplishment of its 
              goals, such as development of shared teaching resources and  improvement of the
              quality of teaching.  In addition, those  schools to be connected expect to see
              significant benefit from  the wider access to information to both faculty and
              students.    Auburn University is providing the project direction for the 
              network connection portion of the overall project.    Each of the universities
              has written a description of its  organization and a statement of the benefits
              of Internet access  that it expects including: greater functionality and
              network  speed to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make  file
              transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable  mail system.
              Students and faculty research will benefit from the  links.  This is also a
              unique opportunity for the schools to  explore innovative educational
              resources.
