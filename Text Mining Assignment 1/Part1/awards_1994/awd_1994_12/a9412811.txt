Abstract    :
              This dissertation study will examine how Cree hunters perceive  and respond to
              environmental changes associated with resource  development in the James Bay
              region of Quebec Province, Canada.  The proposed study will focus on commercial
              forestry and sport  hunting, factors identified by Cree hunters as directly
              affecting  their continued harvest of wildlife, especially moose, a primary 
              source of meat in many Cree communities. Analysis of these  factors using
              anthropological and social impact assessment  approaches will provide detailed
              information on how local systems  are affected by and respond to large-scale
              regional environmental  changes. Results will contribute to our understanding
              of the  nature and scope of environmental changes in northern regions and  the
              effects of such impacts on economic, social and cultural  patterns of northern
              residents, particularly aboriginal peoples.
