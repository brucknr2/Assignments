Abstract    :
              9412068  Paige       The information gained from the proposed experiments has
              the  potential to make important contributions to both basic and applied 
              fields of ecology, evolutionary biology, and agriculture.  In terms  of basic
              science, research is likely to shed light on two specific  areas.  First, this
              research will provide the first insights into  the response of natural plant
              populations to increasing UV-B  radiation.  The research will determine if
              genes for UV-B tolerance  are fixed within natural populations or if there is
              variation for  this trait that would allow for the evolution of more tolerant 
              genotypes.  Second, basic questions concerning the population  biology of
              Arabidopsis will be addressed.  The investigators will  determine the number
              and frequencies of the genotypes within this  population and identify the
              phenotypic traits that distinguish  these genotypes in the field.  The research
              will provide insight  into how these genotypes arise and how are they
              maintained.         The significance of this research to applied biology is
              clear.   Two of the proposed experiments will contribute to knowledge of  plant
              UV-B protective mechanisms.  It is important to identify the  traits that
              protect plants from UV-B radiation and to understand  the mode of inheritance
              of these traits.  Once this is known, this  information can be incorporated
              into conventional breeding  practices and minimize the potential impacts of
              UV-B damage.
