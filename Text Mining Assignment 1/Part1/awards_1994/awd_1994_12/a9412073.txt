Abstract    :
              9412073  Tu  The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the
              University of California, San Diego (UCSD) proposes to purchase a high-current,
              low-energy ion gun system for growing large-bandgap III-V nitrides for
              high-temperature electronic and blue emission optoelectronic applications. 
              With mass separation, the desired species can be selected to reduce background
              impurity contamination.  At energies below the damage threshold and higher than
              the expitaxial growth threshold, and undamaged epitaxial layer can be achieved.
               With a large ion-beam current, the growth rate can be substantial and
              practical.  This new capability of growing nitrides will allow a number of
              faculty members to pursue--in a  comprehensive and cohesive manner-issues in
              growth, characterization, and processing; for example, the initial stage of
              epitaxy by scanning tunneling microscopy; Schottky barrier height and ohmic
              contacts; and dry etching characteristics.  ***
