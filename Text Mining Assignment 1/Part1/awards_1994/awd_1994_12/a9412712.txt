Abstract    :
              9412712  Singh       The primary objective of this proposal is development of a 
              realistic and viable methodology for probabilistic production  cost and
              marginal cost calculations in interconnected power  systems.  Probabilistic
              production cost and reliability  evaluation are two interrelated areas of
              probabilistic modeling  of power systems.  Some recent advancements in
              multi-area  reliability analysis methods will contribute to the proposed 
              solution of problems in production costing, and similarly the  solution of some
              problems in production cost calculation in the  proposed research will lead to
              enhancement of the capability of  multi-area reliability analysis techniques. 
              The end product is  expected to be an integrated approach for production cost, 
              marginal cost, and reliability indices.       Several problems have been
              identifies whose solution will  provide significant advancement of the
              probabilistic production  cost modeling of interconnected power systems and to
              lead to  viable solutions.  These problems are:          Find a
              decomposition-simulation procedure which,       considering all loads states,
              can find indices after       each unit addition by single decomposition.       
               Find efficient techniques for determining production       cost and
              geographically differentiated marginal cost.         Develop methods for more
              accurate modeling of       correlated area loads in an interconnected power    
                system.         Develop a methodology for incorporating load dependent      
              transmission model in the decomposition process.         Develop a methodology
              for incorporating time dependent       interchanges in the decomposition
              process.         Investigate DC Flow vs Network Flow model.         Find
              solutions to problems associated with area-wide       dispatch.         Develop
              the concept of equivalent assistance for a       looped network.        
              Investigate the use of continuous distributions.         Find an algorithm for
              parallelization of the decomposition-       simulation p rocess    ***
