Abstract    :
              9412179  Bachalo   This project will lead to the development of a novel
              diagnostic that can simultaneously measure the velocity, size, and temperature
              of individual droplets in spray flames, and measure the gas phase temperature
              filed surrounding burning droplets in addition to their velocity, size, and
              temperature in controlled experiments involving single droplets, streams, or
              arrays of droplets.  There are no equivalent commercial instruments in the
              market today.   The prototype instrument will be applied to the study of
              droplet interaction in the combustion of high grade and low grade fuels.  the
              effects of various environmental effects such as chemical composition and
              temperature, and fluid dynamical effects such as turbulence and acoustic
              oscillations, on droplet heatup and vaporization will be experimentally
              studied.  The transient heating/ignition of fuel droplets will also be studied.
