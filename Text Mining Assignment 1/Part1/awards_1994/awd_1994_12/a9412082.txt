Abstract    :
              Hobbs/Abstract                Aerosols may plan an important role in the
              radiation balance  of the atmosphere on local, regional and global scales. 
              Recent  estimates suggest that the globally-averaged climate forcing due to 
              the direct effects of anthropogenic sulfate could be similar in  magnitude (but
              opposite in sign) to that produced by anthropogenic  "greenhouse" gases. 
              However, there are large uncertainties  associated with estimating the aerosol
              effects.  The purpose of  this research is to obtain measurements on atmosphere
              aerosols  (with emphasis on those that derive from anthropogenic sources)  that
              will reduce these uncertainties.         The proposed research consists of two
              main activities.         (a)  Measuring aerosol size distributions, chemical   
                                composition, hygroscopic growth factors, light-scattering    
                      efficiency, backscattering of solar radiation, and                 
              singlescattering albedos in the Pacific Northwest,                  California,
              the eastern United States, Alaska and Brazil.         (b)  Conducting an
              aerosol "column-closure" experiment off the            east coast of the USA. 
              Calculations of the effects of              aerosols on solar radiation, based
              on detailed airborne             measurements of the physical and chemical
              properties of             the aerosols, will be compared with satellite        
                            measurements of the backscattering of solar radiation of         
                 ground-based measurements of the attenuation of solar              
              radiation.
