Abstract    :
              Gender issues relate very directly to the participation of women  in science and
              to issues concerning the nature of modern science  and technology.  Prominent
              scholars have individually investigated  and analyzed both phenomena in recent
              years, but there have been no  opportunities for those historians,
              philosophers, sociologists, and  anthropologists currently pursuing the social
              and humanistic  studies of women and science, engineering, and mathematics to
              meet  and discuss their theories and results.  Dr. Sally Gregory  Kohlstedt, a
              historian, and Dr. Helen Longino, a philosopher, are  holding a workshop to
              bring together such researchers with the goal  of improving the conversation,
              finding areas of agreement and  contention, and publishing a result of their
              deliberations.  The  subsequent conference will allow other scholars an
              opportunity to  present papers on related topics and a much larger audience to 
              consider the issues and discuss the implications of research on  "The Women and
              Science Question."  The workshop and conference are  being held May 10-13, 1995
              at the University of Minnesota.
