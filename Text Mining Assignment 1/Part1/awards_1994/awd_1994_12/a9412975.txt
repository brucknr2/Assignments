Abstract    :
              Abstract  Houghton College - G. Bennett        Connection to NSFNET  Proposal
              No.  NCR-9412975  Houghton College request support from NSF for connection of
              its  campus network to NYSERnet.  NYSERnet is the midlevel network  located in
              the state of New York.  NYSERnet will provide operations  management and
              information services and it will provide Houghton  College with a 56 thousand
              bits per second connection to the  NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits
              per second) National  Backbone network.    The college needs greater
              functionality and network speed to be  able to access supercomputers,
              libraries, and make file transfers  along with being able to implement a more
              reliable mail system.   Students and faculty research will benefit from the
              link.  This is  also a unique opportunity for the schools to explore innovative
               educational resources.
