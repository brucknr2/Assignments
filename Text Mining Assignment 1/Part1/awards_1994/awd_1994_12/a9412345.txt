Abstract    :
                    9412345  Corleto  This Research Equipment Grant will make it possible for
              the  Department of Mechanical Engineering and Industrial Engineering,  the
              Environmental Engineering Program and the Department of  Geosciences at Texas
              A&M University to purchase a Digital  Scan/Imaging System (DSIS) that will be
              dedicated to supporting  research in engineering and sciences.  The equipment
              will be used  for several research projects, including; studying the 
              micromechanics of deformation and fracture behavior of rubber-  toughened
              polymers, developing a micromechanics based displacement  and strain measuring
              technique for submicron domains, evaluating  fracture properties of ductile
              polymers and analyzing the influence  of fractal geometry theories in particle
              aggregation mechanisms in  aquatic environments.  The acquisition of the DSIS
              will  significantly enhance the research capabilities at Texas A&M  University
              - Kingsville which is one of the largest producers of  Hispanic graduates in
              the fields of advanced engineering, science  and mathematics.  ***
