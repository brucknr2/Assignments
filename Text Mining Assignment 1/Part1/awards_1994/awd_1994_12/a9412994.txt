Abstract    :
              9412994  Jewell      This award is supported through the Small Grants for
              Exploratory  Research Mechanism.    This project investigates preprimary
              gubernatorial endorsing  conventions to be held by political parties in seven
              states in  1994, a year when most governors are elected.  These states are 
              unique because party leaders are trying to influence the outcome  of the
              nominating process.    The study of state political parties has seldom
              emphasized the  nominating process, and often it has been limited to
              single-state  case studies.  This research project, by replicating a cross- 
              state study conducted in 1982, will permit comparative analysis  both across
              states and across time.  The study will determine  whether there have been
              changes in the endorsement process, in  the electoral success of endorsees, and
              in the evaluations of the  endorsement system by delegates attending the
              conventions.  ***
