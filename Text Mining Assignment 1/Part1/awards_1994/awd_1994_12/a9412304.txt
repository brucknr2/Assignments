Abstract    :
              9412304  Patterson     This project investigates the balance between
              heterotrophy and symbiotic autotrophy in sponges, a topic that we know very
              little about.  Through a series of laboratory experiments the investigators
              will determine the effects of ecosystem (freshwater vs. marine), sponge
              morphology, and energy regime on the extent of sponge heterotrophy and
              autotrophy.  The techniques employed are novel and include flow cytometry and
              DNA to RNA ratios.    This study will result in new fundamental understanding
              of the biology of sponges and their role in ecosystems.  The results of this
              study can be applied to ecosystem management, especially for those ecosystems
              in which sponges are important, including such diverse systems as Lake Baikal
              and the Florida Keys.
