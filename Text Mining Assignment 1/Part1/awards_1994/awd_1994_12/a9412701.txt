Abstract    :
              9412701  Samulski    This research is concerned with characterization and 
              quantification of intermolecular forces in liquid crystals  (LCs). The ultimate
              goal is to understand the properties of  liquid crystals in terms of their
              molecular structural  features to allow rational designs for new mesogens 
              optimized for specific applications (high contrast ratios,  rapid switching,
              high spontaneous polarization, etc.). This  is achieved through carefully
              constructed experiments and  associated modeling of the experimental findings
              with the  intention of deriving a general formulation of molecular  ordering in
              LCs in terms of an orientational potential.  Knowledge of orientational
              potentials allows one to  construct the molecular orientation distribution and
              thereby  calculate a molecule's order tensor, and compute and  correlate
              thermodynamic properties of mesogens with  molecular structure.  %%%  This
              project is concerned with the measurement of molecular  properties in liquid
              crystals (LCs) so that improved LCs can  be engineered for new display
              applications such as high  definition TV. This is achieved by studying the
              behavior of  selected solutes dissolved in LC solvents in order to  clarify the
              importance of the different kinds of  intermolecular interactions that
              contribute to the electro  optic responses of these unusual fluids. The goal is
              an  increased understanding of the molecular origins of  important physical and
              technologically significant  characteristics of liquid crystals (e.g.,
              birefringence,  spontaneous electric polarization) with the ulterior motive  of
              designing more responsive and higher contrast materials  for LC displays.
