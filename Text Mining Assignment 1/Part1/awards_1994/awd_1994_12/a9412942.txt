Abstract    :
                    9412942  Islam  In the environment, natural cementation of geological
              formations  occurs constantly over the geological time due to physical, 
              chemical and biological reactions.     The research launches  a plan to develop
              a new technique of  microbial cementation of fissures or fractures of buildings
              and  monuments.  Laboratory-scale experiments are to be used in order to 
              optimize parameters that govern the microbial cementation process.   Laboratory
              results will then be scaled up using a numerical  simulator and a design for
              field application will be completed.
