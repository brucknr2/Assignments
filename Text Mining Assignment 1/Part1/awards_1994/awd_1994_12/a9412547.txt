Abstract    :
                   This is a project to provide peer-reviewed small research grants through
              the Advancement of the Discipline program of the American Sociological
              Association.  It is a continuation of a very successful program that assisted a
              significant number of promising sociologists to undertake pilot research
              projects or to complete limited but innovative and creative studies.  The
              maximum amount for an NSF/ASA small research grant will be $4,000.  Half of the
              funding for these grants will come from NSF, and half from the ASA.  Proposals
              are reviewed for scientific merit.  The selection committee consists of four
              members of the ASA Council, the ASA Vice President, the ASA Executive Officer,
              and one representative from NSF.  The structure of the selection committee
              assures that a panel of distinguished social scientists evaluates the
              proposals.    %%%   Through the coordination and outreach of the American
              Sociological Association, funds are allocated expeditiously and in accord with
              scientific merit for scholars to engage in exploratory research where support
              from other sources would be difficult to acquire.  Thus, these small grants
              constitute an invaluable form of venture capital for research that has the
              potential for challenging the discipline, for stimulating new lines of
              scientific research, and for facilitating new networks of scientific
              collaboration.
