Abstract    :
              9412634  Williams  An Engineering Faculty Internship will support a joint study
              with  Durametallic Corporation on the performance of mechanical end  face
              seals.  Specifically, the study will address the effect of  industrially
              produced surface finishes on the friction, wear,  leakage, and evolution of
              surface topography during running-in.  The goal is to develop guidelines for
              selection of materials and  manufacturing and finishing processes that will
              assure optimally  performing seals.  ***
