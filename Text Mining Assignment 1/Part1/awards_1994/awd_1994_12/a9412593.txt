Abstract    :
                        Retinal ganglion cells connect the nerve cells that process 
              information in the eye with the visual centers of the brain.  In  the
              vertebrate retina, most retinal ganglion cells respond to light  with either an
              increase in activity (ON-cells) or a decrease in  activity (OFF-cells).  In the
              mature retina, two features  characterize the organization of the ON and OFF
              ganglion cells.   First, the processes of ON and OFF cells ramify at different
              levels  in the retina, and second, ON and OFF cells are distributed across  the
              retina in regular mosaic patterns.  The studies performed in  this research
              program are directed at understanding the events  underlying the formation of
              ON and OFF retinal pathways.  Neuronal  activity is known to play a role in the
              establishment and  refinement of neural connections in a number of systems.  In
              these  investigations a series of experiments will be undertaken that are 
              designed to assess the contribution of afferent input to  stratification of
              dendritic arbors in the inner plexiform layer of  the retina, and the role that
              axonal interactions at target nuclei  play in programmed cell death and in
              defining dendritic territories  in the retina.  Precise and appropriate
              patterns of connections are  necessary for the normal function of the nervous
              system.  These  studies will contribute in a fundamental way to our
              understanding  of the strategies used in the development of these connections.
