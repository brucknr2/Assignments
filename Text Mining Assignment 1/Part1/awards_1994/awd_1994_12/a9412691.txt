Abstract    :
              9412691  Shetty  Toughened ceramics, including transformation-toughened 
              zirconia based ceramics and whisker-and fiber-reinforced  ceramic composites,
              are susceptible to true cyclic fatigue  phenomena.  The associated high
              subcritical crack-growth  rates in cyclic loading can arise from either
              extrinsic  (degradation of crack shielding) or intrinsic (crack-tip  damage)
              mechanisms.  The research proposed will investigate  the origins of cyclic
              fatigue in ceria partially stabilized  zirconia/alumina and self-reinforced
              silicon nitride by  separating the contributions of the extrinsic and the 
              intrinsic mechanisms via direct measurements of crack  shielding using Roman
              microprobe spectroscopy.  Critical  comparison of the measured shielding with
              the theories of  crack shielding and direct examination of the transformation 
              or bridging zones via Transmission and scanning electron  microscopes
              techniques are also the important elements of  the proposed research.  %%%  The
              proposed research will investigate the origin of cyclic  fatigue in
              ceria-partially stabilized zirconia/alumina and  self reinforced silicon
              nitride by means of Roman  spectroscopy and electron microscope.  ***
