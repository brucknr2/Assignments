Abstract    :
              9412387  Tessier  University of Akron  Dr. Claire Tessier, Chemistry Department,
              University of Akron, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and
              Organometallic Chemistry Program for the preparation of main group and
              transition metal heterocyclynes. Cyclyne ligands are cyclic polyalkynes. The
              first goal of the research is the synthesis of cyclynes with three alkynes, two
              phenyl groups and a heteroatom in an 11 membered ring. The heteroatoms to be
              included in the ring include  main and transition metals. The interaction of
              these heterocyclynes with further transition metals will be investigated,
              particularly in regard to the formation of complexes in which a transition
              metal is complexed within the cavity of the ligand. The geometric constraints
              of the cavity and ring may force a metal-metal bonding interaction between
              metals in the  ring and those in the cavity.   Unsymmetrical compounds which
              contain two metals are being exploited to activate small molecules like carbon
              monoxide and as  non-linear optical materials. This study will form a new class
              of  such complexes by forming a metal containing ring of atoms which contains a
              cavity which a  second metal may enter. The two metals   will be close enough
              to interact with each other, and this may yield new systems capable of
              activating small molecules and  give rise to unique optical properties.
