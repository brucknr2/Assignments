Abstract    :
              9412347  Bachus  The PI of this Equipment Grant proposes to purchase an 
              OPTOTRAK  3020 3D Motion Measurement System to support  research in
              bioengineering.  The equipment will be used in  projects for measuring the 3
              dimensional translation and  rotation of the spine.  The goal of the research
              is to  significantly enhance the performance of implanted  orthopedic devices. 
              Measurements include the 3D motion of  vertebrae to better understand the
              effects of spinal  deformities, instabilities, and instrumentation on the 
              spine.  ***
