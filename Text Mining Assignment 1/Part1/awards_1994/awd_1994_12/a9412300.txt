Abstract    :
              9412300  Vortex excitations play an important role in determining the 
              thermodynamical properties of quasi-two dimensional magnetic  crystals.  The
              proposed research will study the fundamental  dynamical properties of the
              vortices such as their mass and life  time using numerical simulations.  The
              dependence of vortex  properties on the nature and strength of the spin space
              anisotropy  will be explored in detail.  These studies are relevant in various 
              experiments to confirm the existence of vortices.  %%%  Quasi-two dimensional
              magnetic materials are of great theoretical  and experimental interest in
              recent years.  It is believed that  major excitations of the systems are
              vortices with very unusual  properties.  This research will focus on studying
              vortex dynamics.  The study will be useful in confirming the existence of
              vortices.
