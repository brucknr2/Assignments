Abstract    :
              9412920  Prasad  The goal of this project is to initiate high speed electrical
              characterization of optical components in optoelectronic integrated circuits
              (OEIC's).  This is to be followed by the characterization of full OEIC's.  An
              existing automatic network analyzer and on-wafer probe station with measurement
              capability up to a frequency of 40 GHz is to be suitably modified with a
              photodector and auxiliary optical equipment to allow optical as well as
              electrical RF measurements.  Laser diode, light emitting diode and detector
              models will be extracted using scattering parameter measurements and the
              microwave modulation response of the devices will be measured with a view to
              optimization of the modulation bandwidth.  Optoelectronic circuits and systems
              will be investigated with particular attention being given to a critical
              comparison between the performance when a) both input and output are
              electrical, b) both input and output are optical, c) the input is electrical
              and the output is optical, and d) the input is optical and the output is
              electrical.  This part of the research will be initiated with measurements of
              an optoelectronic transceiver with LED sources as well as with lasers, M-S-M
              detectors and GaAs MESFET VLSI electronics.  The measurement and
              characterization methods developed in this initial phase will be sufficiently
              general so that they can also be applied to other optoelectronics circuits and
              systems.  ***
