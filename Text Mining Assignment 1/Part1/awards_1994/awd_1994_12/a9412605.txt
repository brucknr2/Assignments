Abstract    :
                    The  goal  of  this  research is to study the regulation  by  the  nervous
               system of the female sexual behavior of an  animal  that  displays  sexual
              receptivity at all times of the cycle and  year,  the  female  musk shrew. Musk
              shrews are primitive  mammals  from  tropical and subtropical areas of
              Southeastern Asia. Reproduction  is  not  cyclic, but occurs year round
              whenever local  conditions  are  favorable. Female musk shrews maintain high
              levels of  serum  testosterone.  Experiments are designed to  test  the  idea 
              that  conversion  of testosterone to estrogen in certain parts  of  the  brain 
              are critical for the activation of female sexual behavior.  In  musk  shrews
              mating occurs when estrogen levels are  low  and  testosterone   concentrations
               are  high.   The   conversion   of  testosterone  to estrogen to activate
              sexual behavior  is  better  than  maintaining high levels of estrogen since
              estrogen can  act  as a neurotoxin. Androgens have been implicated in the
              expression  of  female sexual behavior in other animals so these studies  may 
              shed  light  on  neural regulation of female sexual  behavior  in  other female
              animals.
