Abstract    :
              9413305     Weir       The fifth Gordon Conference on Quantitative Genetics and 
              Biotechnology will be held February 12-17, 1995.  at least 26  invited
              participants will present recent and current results on the  relationship
              between molecular genetics and quantitative traits.   Advances in animal, human
              and plant genetics will be treated, along  with theoretical developments in
              statistical and evolutionary  genetics.         This continuing series of
              conferences has been one of the main  venues for molecular and quantitative
              geneticists to interact, and  it has played a role in the explosion of activity
              in setting up  genetic maps for livestock,and in subsequently locating genes 
              affecting quantitative traits.
