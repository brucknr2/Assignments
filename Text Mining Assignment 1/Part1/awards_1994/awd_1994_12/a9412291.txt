Abstract    :
              Dr. Creager is examining the development of biochemistry and molecular biology
              as culturally authoritative and institutionally powerful disciplines after
              World War II.  Her focus is on the scientific and rhetorical uses of tobacco
              mosaic virus, a plant virus studied in laboratories of biochemist Wendell
              Stanley,  who received the 1946 Nobel Prize for its crystallization.  The major
              part of this study concerns the changes in scientific research and disciplinary
              power which occurred in the postwar period.  Stanley's laboratory and
              departments in Berkeley serve as a case study in the institutional building of
              biochemistry and molecular biology after the war.  Her analysis focuses on the
              uses of viruses as key medical and agricultural agents in gaining public
              support for molecular virology as well as on attempts to center disciplines of
              biochemistry and molecular biology around viruses as laboratory materials. 
              This project aims to integrate historical developments in molecular biology and
              biochemistry with other cultural and political changes in twentieth-century
              America.
