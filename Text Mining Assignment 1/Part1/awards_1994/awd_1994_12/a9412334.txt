Abstract    :
              This work, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, is  
              focused on the development of Fourier transform - ion cyclotron resonance  
              mass spectrometry for the structural characterization of peptides in the  
              1,000 to 10,000 Dalton molecular weight range.  Laser desorption of   neutral
              species, followed by chemical ionization, is used to generate the   ions, which
              are then analyzed using tandem mass spectrometry.  Techniques   that involve
              refocusing the ions in the center of the ion cyclotron cell   will be developed
              to improve sensitivity, and different chemical   ionization reagents, including
              metal ions, will be explored to provide   maximum information about the peptide
              sequence.    Professor Amster and his graduate students at the University of
              Georgia   will investigate improved methods for the characterization of
              peptides   using mass spectrometry.  Reactions between laser desorption
              molecules   and gas-phase ionic reagents will be studied.  Advances in this
              area have   important implications for biotechnology, including the
              characterization   of new peptide drugs.
