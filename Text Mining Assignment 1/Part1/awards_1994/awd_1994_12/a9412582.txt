Abstract    :
              9412582  Tsao  This project is on research to study the production  of fumaric 
              acid by Rhizopus oryzae.  A procedure for removing the product by  resin
              adsorption as it is formed in the bioreactor will be used  to avoid product
              inhibition.  In addition to developing this  process, this research will also
              investigate the effect of oxygen  supply and carbon dioxide transfer.  A
              mathematical model based  on material balances, process kinetics, and
              bioenergetics will be  developed and used in an analysis of the process.  ***
