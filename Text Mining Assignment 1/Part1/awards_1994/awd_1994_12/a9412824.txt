Abstract    :
              94-12824    Manuccia    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
              project will develop a new kind of  compact flow sensor and control system,
              called the Optical Flow Controller (OFC), for use in chemical vapor deposition
              (CVD) and other semiconductor processing operations.  Phase I successfully
              tested a laboratory prototype flow controller that uses a new technique called
              spectral correlation detection (SCD).  This is an improved variant of infrared
              absorption spectroscopy that provides enhanced sensitivity and stability as
              well as a simplified optical design.    Phase II will provide several
              alpha-test devices for later Phase II development.  The OFC device is
              particularly useful when the analyte is dilute in a carrier gas and is
              generated by bubbling the carrier through a liquid phase sample of the analyte.
               This configuration is commonly used in organometallic-CVD and other
              semiconductor processing applications.    The OFC technology is expected to
              find wide application in commercial manufacture of semiconductor devices,
              optical components, and thin films.
