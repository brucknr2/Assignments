Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9412820  Smith     This proposal was submitted in response to the
              Engineering Faculty Internships Initiative and was submitted to the review
              process.  The proposal requests funds to support an internship for professor R.
              N. Smith at the Manufacturing Technology Laboratory of the General Electric
              Corporate Research and Development Center during the summer of 1994.  The focus
              of his efforts while there will be to study and familiarize himself with
              current manufacturing processes and how improved heat transfer techniques,
              analysis, and technology can enhance these processes.
