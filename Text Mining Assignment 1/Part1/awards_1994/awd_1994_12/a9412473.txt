Abstract    :
              The investigator and his colleagues organize a workshop on  algorithms and
              parallel implementations for macromolecular  dynamics, protein folding, and
              structure refinement, including  the modeling of quantum effects.  The emphasis
              is on numerical  and algorithmic challenges to achieving dramatic gains in the 
              performance of software for protein and polymer simulations.       This
              workshop brings together mathematicians, computer  scientists, chemists, and
              biologists seeking dramatic gains in  the performance of software for protein
              and polymer simulations.  Molecular dynamics has contributed to the
              understanding of many  physical, chemical, and biological phenomena, and is now
              a  standard tool of the pharmaceutical industry.  With improvements    in
              technology, larger and more complex biological molecules have  been analyzed,
              but there are substantial barriers to the next  phase of computer simulation:
              the analysis of proteins, DNA, and  other polymers on millisecond time scales. 
              These challenges can  only be overcome with a strong interdisciplinary effort. 
              The aim  of this workshop is to improve the flow of ideas between  disciplines
              and to focus on the latest breakthroughs.
