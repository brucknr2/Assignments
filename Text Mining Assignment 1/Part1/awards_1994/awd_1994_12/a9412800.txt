Abstract    :
              9412800  Cande  Description:  This proposal will support the first joint U.S.- 
              Indo symposium in geomagnetism which will be hosted by the Indian  Institute of
              Geomagnetism (IIG), Bombay, August 22-26, 1994.  Its  purpose is to explore
              promising new areas of research with Indian  scientists such as the effect of
              the equatorial electrojet on  magnetic field satellites, marine magnetic data
              from the Indian  Ocean, rock magnetism, and biomagnetism.    The symposium is
              an activity resulting from a workshop initiated  by the U.S. Geodynamics
              Committee and supported by NSF, "The  Global Magnetic Environment: Challenges
              and Opportunities,  Washington, D.C., March 1992."  Workshop topics included:
              1) the  scope of geomagnetic research as applied to the deep Earth, the 
              Earth's crust, the oceans, the ionosphere and near Earth  Environment, 2) new
              areas of research, 3) identification of more  optimum locations for
              observatories/shared facilities, and 4) the  global aspects of emerging
              programs.       Scope:  Considering the strong interest expressed by American 
              geomagnetists in learning about the work of their Indian  colleagues, as well
              as India's long standing desire to  collaborate with US scientists, the
              proposed symposium is a  highly effective vehicle for beginning communication
              between  Indian and U.S. geomagnetists.  NSF will provide travel support  for
              five US participants at this workshop.  India's location at  the geomagnetic
              equator provides unique opportunities for  collaboration in this field for the
              U.S.  ***
