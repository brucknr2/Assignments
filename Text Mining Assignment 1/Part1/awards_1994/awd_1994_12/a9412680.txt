Abstract    :
              9412680  Segel  Research will be carried out at CERN on determination of the 
              neutron and proton spin structure functions.  Polarized muons  will be
              scattered from polarized hydrogen and deuterium targets.  The experiments will
              be carried out in collaboration with a large  group of US and European
              researchers, the Spin Muon  Collaboration.  These measurements will help
              identify the  fraction of the nucleon's spin carried by quarks and gluons, test
               fundamental sum-rules related to electroweak interactions, and  probe the
              strange quark content of the nucleon.  ***
