Abstract    :
              CTS-9412747  J. Peddieson, Tennessee Technological Institute    This is an
              Engineering Faculty Internship (EFI), proposed in response to the initiative
              Grant Opportunities for Academic Research with Industry (GOALI).  The P. I.
              will visit Fleetguard, Inc. (Tennessee), and collaborate with that company to a
              research project on depth/cake filtration.  Filter cake formation on a clogging
              filter medium and the depth filtration within the filter medium due to particle
              penetration will be modeled using the industrial site.  The interaction with
              the industrial partner will help to identify the critical technical issues,
              improve the method and it verification.    It is expected that the resulted
              approach to predict depth/cake filtration will be applied in the areas of
              chemical manufacturing, petroleum refining and water purification.  The
              awareness of the P. I. and his student to industrial needs may lead to are
              direction of the research.  ***
