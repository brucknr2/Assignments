Abstract    :
              9412125  Newcombe    The objective of this workshop is to issue recommendations
              for how to facilitate research at the intersection of Cognitive Science and the
              teaching and learning of science and mathematics.  The Workshop will be
              attended by representatives of the cognitive science community who do research
              on the description and development of those abilities, concepts, and processes
              underlying mathematics and science skills, representatives of the educational
              community who are researcher-practitioners, and representatives from Federal
              agencies.  The workshop will consider how the Cognitive Science and Education
              Research communities can more fruitfully interact to provide the research
              underpinnings for strengthening mathematics and science education.  The final
              report will issue recommendations for future research initiatives that promote
              such an interaction.  Such research will strengthen American economic
              competitiveness by educating a workforce better prepared for the technological
              demands of the 21st Century.    ***
