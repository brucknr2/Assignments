Abstract    :
              9412150  Rust    This dissertation enhancement grant provides  partial support
              for a U.S. graduate student,  Myra E. Barnes, working under the guidance of 
              Dr. Richard W. Rust, of the Department of  Biology at the University of Nevada,
              Reno, to  study two species of Acacia trees in northern  Botswana.  A low rate
              of seedling establishment  has curtailed replacement of trees destroyed as  a
              result of elephant foraging.  Observational  and experimental methods will be
              used to  determine which biotic and abiotic factors  influence the rate of seed
              production,  germination, seedling establishment, and  survival of trees to
              reproductive maturity.   The goal of the research is to determine  whether
              pollinators, insect, avian, or mammal  seed predators, browsers, soil water
              potential,  fire, or a combination of these or other  factors, limit seedling
              establishment and  survival.  The research will be conducted at  seven existing
              study sites in four wildlife  areas in northern Botswana and two or more 
              additional sites which will be added later in  1994.  Staff members from
              Botswana's Department  of Wildlife and National Parks will collaborate  with
              Ms. Barnes on this project.    This study will make an important contribution 
              to the understanding of elephant-habitat  interactions as they relate to
              biological  diversity in northern Botswana.  The grant will  also provide
              support to enable a promising  student to establish a strong independent 
              research career.  ***
