Abstract    :
              94120215  Lau  A Fourier Transform Spectrometer(FTS) will be purchased which
              will be dedicated to support research in compound semiconductor materials and
              devices.  The spectrometer will be used for several research projects,
              including in particular:  (1) THz semiconductor sources,  (2) Two-dimensional
              electron gas hot-electron mixers and  detectors for the FIR region  (3)
              Tensile-strained semiconductor quantum-well lasers,  (4) Superlattice-based
              Solar cells,  (5) Complex Permittivity and integrated waveguide applications 
              of semiconductor superlattices,  (6) Unipolar Avalanche Multiplication in III-V
              semiconductor  quantum wells,  (7) Impurity identification of OMVPE grown
              high-purity III-V  semiconductors.    All of the above on-going research will
              greatly benefit from the acquisition of the FTS, which will be specified to
              cover a spectral range extended to the far-infrared.  ***
