Abstract    :
              9412813  MORIN   This award will provide laboratory supplies for DNA sequencing
              to enhance the dissertation work of a PhD graduate student.  The organisms
              being studied are cypridnid ostracodes, very small Crustacea which live in 
              Caribbean waters and exhibit remarkable bioluminescent courtship displays that,
              like fireflies, are specific or distinctive for each species.  Prior work using
              morphological information has helped to divulge relationships among some
              members of this interesting group but the relationships of other members remain
              to be resolved and the molecular data (DNA sequences from 3 mitochondrial
              genes) of this project should contribute new and useful information for this
              purpose.  Once a phylogeny or pattern of relationships has been established, it
              can be utilized in testing hypotheses about the evolution of different
              components of the sequence of bioluminescent display behaviors.  %%%  Support
              for the training of graduate students in modern systematic methodologies is
              important for maintaining a workforce of scientists capable of addressing the
              questions and issues of biodiversity which are of increasing global concern. 
              The results of this study can be used to elucidate patterns of courtship
              behavior that are important for maintaining reproductive isolation or the
              distinctness of species.  ***
