Abstract    :
              9412815  Greenblatt        This award supports collaboration on the design of
              new solid  electrolyte composites by dispersion of ionically conductive  salts
              in microporous solids.  The collaboration between Dr.  Martha Greenblatt,
              Rutgers University, and Feng Shouhua,  Jilin University, is expected to
              contribute new insights  into the mechanism by which enhanced ionic
              conductivity can  be generated in composites of conducting salts and 
              microporous solids.    Synthesis and characterization of materials such as this
              has  potential use in commercial application. Support for the  collaboration
              will be provided on the Chinese side by the  National Natural Science
              Foundation.
