Abstract    :
              9412818  Koonin  This proposal will support a three year program of research in 
              theoretical nuclear physics at the W. K. Kellogg Radiation  Laboratory of the
              California Institute of Technology for the  period of August 1, 1994 to July
              31, 1996.  The research proposed  involves new continuing work on the
              description of nuclei and  other quantum many-body systems.  The training of
              graduate and  undergraduate students and post-doctoral fellows is an integral 
              part of the proposed research.  ***
