Abstract    :
              9412759  Dravinski  The objective of this project is to obtain the predominant 
              frequencies of vibration of ground motion in the San Fernando  Valley area, and
              to compare them with the resonant frequencies of  several key structures which
              suffered significant damage during  the Northridge earthquake of January 17,
              1994.  This comparison  permits the identification of "double resonance". 
              (Double  resonance occurs when the fundamental period of the ground  coincides
              with the resonant frequency of the structure.)    The specific tasks include:
              (1) the measurement of long-period  microtremor response at highway bridges and
              overpasses which  suffered severe damage during the earthquake (microtremors
              are  naturally-occurring ground vibrations), and (2) measurement of  long
              period microtremor response at seventy sites within the San  Fernando Valley
              with simultaneous recordings at a reference  bedrock site.  ***
