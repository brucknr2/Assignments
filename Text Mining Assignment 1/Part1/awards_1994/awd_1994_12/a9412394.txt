Abstract    :
                9412394  Storm    Support is provided for the 1994 Gordon Research Conference
              on  Physical Metallurgy "Time-Dependent Behavior in Metals:   Measurement and
              Modeling for the Long Term".  The goal of this  conference is provide a forum
              for active discussions on state-of-  the-art experimental and modeling
              techniques aimed at understanding  complex damage phenomena that evolve in
              metals over long times.   Such damage often involves the coupling of
              microstructural changes,  surface chemical or electrochemical reactivity,
              plastic  deformation, solute segregation, microdamage evolution and hydrogen 
              interactions leading to crack formation and growth.  The speakers  and
              discussion have been organized around critical topics,  including
              microstructural evolution under applied stress and  strain, crack formation and
              growth at elevated temperatures, the  interaction of environment with such
              cracking, the effect of solute  elements on deformation and fracture,
              environmentally-induced  cracking, as well as localized corrosion under stress.
               A focus of  this program is the integration of physical and mechanical 
              metallurgy perspectives which have been separated in previous  years.  %%% 
              There is a pressing need to consider these problems from an  interdisciplinary
              and scientific perspective because the national  infrastructure is aging and
              long-life systems are being  contemplated and designed with advanced materials.
               Although such  problems are complex from a scientific viewpoint, researchers
              in  universities, industry and national laboratories are now addressing  them
              with exciting high resolution experimental tools, theory and  simulation
              modelling.  ***
