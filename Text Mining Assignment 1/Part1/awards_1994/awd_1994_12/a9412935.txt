Abstract    :
                    ABSTRACT        This proposal addresses Phase 1 of a three-phase,
              multi-year effort to scale the National Engineering Education Delivery System
              (NEEDS) to a form of continental dimension useful and available to all
              engineering schools in the U.S.        Phase 1 consists of a series of five
              meetings, each designed to acquaint those unfamiliar with the concept with one
              or more of the aspects of NEEDS.  As a result of these meetings, the recently
              formed Nationalization of NEEDS Committee (NNC) will evolve.  The meetings deal
              with the several parts of the NEED System, as well as the pedagogical
              principles, links and underpinnings that both drive its development and are
              embedded in its use.  The meetings are also designed to explore the range of
              concerns that might exist on the part of the Coalitions other than Synthesis in
              adopting NEEDS as the standard upon which engineering education can transition
              from its current forms of learning to a format that includes electronically
              mediated instruction.  At the end of Phase 1, a report will be produced by the
              Committee that will indicate what will need to be done to scale-up the current
              prototype.      A later Phase 2 will have a goal to demonstrate by all
              Coalitions and others the scaled-up NEEDS prototype at the 1996 ASEE National
              Meeting in Washington, D.C.      A later Phase 3 will involve the work
              necessary to institutionalize NEEDS for the country.  This may mean, for
              example, handing over the database part of the scaled-up NEEDS prototype to the
              national library system.
