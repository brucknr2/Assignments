Abstract    :
              9412646  Meller       The objective of this faculty internship project is to 
              investigate the use of decision models that integrate problems of  design and
              operation in an apparel distribution center.  Two  distribution centers are the
              targets of the project.  These centers are located in Alexander City and
              Montgomery, Alabama.  The models to be investigated will incorporate problems
              of order  accumulation/sortation, warehouse layout, and order picking.  The 
              reason for the integration comes from the interactions between  these problems
              in affecting the performance of a distribution  center.       The project is in
              an area that American industries face steep international competition.  The
              results from the project will be used by warehouse operators and managers to
              design and operate more efficient warehouses and distribution centers that are
              more responsive to time-based service issues such as just-in-time delivery and
              quick order turn around time.
