Abstract    :
                    9412361  Spontak  This Research Equipment Grant will make it possible for
              the  Departments of Materials Science and Engineering and Chemical  Engineering
              at North Carolina State University to purchase  cryomicroscopy instrumentation
              that is needed for examination of  the morphologies of polymer and furfactant
              aggregate structures.   This equipment will improve the capabilities of
              existing electron  microscopes and it is critical for the ultimate success of 
              morphological studies addressing fundamental research in areas  dealing with
              solvated polymers and surfactants.  **
