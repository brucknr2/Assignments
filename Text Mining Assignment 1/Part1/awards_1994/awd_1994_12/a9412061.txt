Abstract    :
              9412061  Philips  This Dissertation Improvement project examines the cultural, 
              ideological, and behavioral dimensions of domestic violence and  law among the
              Wolof of St. Louis, Senegal.  Study subjects will  include female and male
              disputants and legal professionals  participating in domestic violence cases at
              the Regional  Tribunal.  Anthropological methods, including structured and 
              unstructured interviews, court observations, and participant  observation will
              elicit information on a number of subjects  pertaining to law and domestic
              violence.  The chief objective of  this study is to determine to what extent
              the law provides a  means for challenging domestic violence, and,
              alternatively, in  what measure it maintains the conditions enabling domestic 
              violence to persist.  To pursue this objective, three sets of  questions will
              be investigated:  (1) what beliefs do female and  male disputants hold
              regarding the law, gender, and violence, and  how do these beliefs shape the
              demands disputants make on the  legal system?; (2) how do legal professionals
              interpret the law,  and how does this affect their handling of cases and case 
              outcomes?; and (3) do case outcomes offer remedies for women  facing domestic
              violence?  Information obtained from this  research will be of potential use to
              legal professionals and  scholars in the United States, Senegal, and the rest
              of the  Islamic world.
