Abstract    :
                  9412990  Rubinstein  This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research type
              project to  evaluate the possibility of using the grain growth associated with 
              recrystallization to locate the elastic-plastic interface in front  of a crack.
               Such knowledge would be useful in evaluating theories  of fracture mechanics. 
              The main issue is the development of  temperature-time pattern for the sample
              heat treatment to yield the  most sensitivity at the elastic-plastic interface.
