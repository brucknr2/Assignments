Abstract    :
               Nerve cells employ calcium ions to convert electrical  signals to biochemical
              changes within the cell.  Electrical  activity increases intracellular calcium.
               Once inside the  cell, calcium acts as a messenger carrying information to 
              various parts of the cell interior.  Only during electrical  stimulation, or
              during certain pathologies, is the calcium  concentration in the cell elevated.
               Under normal conditions  the intracellular calcium concentration is kept very
              low by  a complex series of pathways which pump calcium out of the  cell.  The
              goal of this project is to characterize the  processes which remove calcium
              from neurons.  The principal  objective is to determine how calcium pumps are
              modulated by  drugs and environmental factors.  Toward this objective 4 
              specific aims are proposed.  1)  The effects of altered  energy metabolism on
              calcium buffering by mitochondria will  be determined.  2)  The possibility
              that various members of  the calcium pump family selectively regulate specific
              cell  functions will be explored.  3)  The effects of hormones and 
              neurotransmitters on calcium pump activity will be  determined.  4)  The
              hypothesis that a specialized calcium  extrusion protein is localized to nerve
              endings will be  tested.  To achieve these goals neurons will be grown in 
              culture (in a dish), and studied individually employing  optical and
              electrophysiological instrumentation developed  by the investigator.  This work
              will increase our  understanding of how neurons process information at the 
              molecular and cellular level, and may reveal new targets for  drugs.
