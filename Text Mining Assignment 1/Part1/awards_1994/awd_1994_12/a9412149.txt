Abstract    :
               This is a Research Planning Grant for a woman scientist.  It is a study of
              identity transformation in drug addiction, examining the impact of cultural,
              social-structural, and personal factors.  It extends the internal and external
              validity, chiefly in conceptual coherence and scope, of an identity-based
              etiological model of addiction that has earlier demonstrated success in
              explaining the identity transformations of addicts following their movement
              into drug addiction.  A research instrument will be constructed and preliminary
              analysis will be undertaken, including instrument refinement, using a
              stratified probability sample of diverse individuals (whites and blacks, males
              and females) seeking treatment for drug addiction in Michigan.  The results of
              the ultimate research project promise to produce a more culturally and
              structurally inclusive identity-based etiological model of drug addiction and
              an increased understanding of the link between maco-sociological and
              micro-sociological processes in identity formation.  %%%   This project will
              contribute to solution of a difficult social problem with extensive policy
              implications, and it will extend an important scientific theory concerning the
              ways that personal and social factors shape an individual's self-image.  In
              addition, it will assist a woman scientist in establishing a productive
              research career.
