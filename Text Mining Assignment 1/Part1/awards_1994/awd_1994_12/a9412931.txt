Abstract    :
              9412931  Crowe  These diodes are now in use around the world for a variety of
              scientific applications, including, radio astronomy, plasma diagnostics,
              chemical spectroscopy, atmospheric chemistry, and compact range radar
              measurements.  Previous research has led to the creation of devices that have
              record performance at frequencies from 1-5 THz.  These studies have also
              indicated that further performance improvements and increased operating
              frequency are possible.  Three graduate students will be involved in this
              research, two of which will be supported by this grant. Together these students
              will form a team that strives to fully understand the physics of operation,
              design and fabrication, and testing and evaluation of THz Schottky diodes.   
              The second technological goal is the research of a novel varactor diode based
              on a Schottky contact to a two-dimensional electron gas and its use as a
              millimeter and submillimeter wavelength multiplier.  This inherently planar
              device technology has already demonstrated comparable performance to
              state-of-the-art planar Schottky devices.  Through this research, these novel
              varactor diodes will be shown to have superior performance to standard Schottky
              varactors and will thereby become an important source of millimeter and
              submillimeter wavelength power.  ***
