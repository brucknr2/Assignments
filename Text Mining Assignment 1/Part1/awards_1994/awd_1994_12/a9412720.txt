Abstract    :
              9412720  Chidsey  This research project addresses the structural origins of the 
              rates of long distance electron transfer across interfaces.  It  is supported
              by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry program,  with a goal of understanding
              the role of intervening and  surrounding material in the transfer of electrons
              between a  metal electrode and a precisely positioned electroactive  species. 
              The continuum dielectric model will be examined as a  basis for understanding
              and predicting the activation barrier  to electron transfer, the role of
              electroactive species located  between the metal and the polar electrolyte will
              be examined,  and the effect of electronic states of the spacer material on 
              electron transfer will be probed in these studies.  Thiol  monolayers on gold
              electrodes form the basis for these electron  transfer studies.  These
              measurements will have impact on the  development of new sensor and display
              technologies, and will  help to develop an understanding of interfacial charge
              transfer  in applications ranging from biology to microelectronics.  %%%  In
              order to understand the rates and mechanisms of charge  transfer between
              electrodes and electroactive species, a number  of model approaches have been
              developed.  One very promising  approach uses self assembled monolayer
              technology to position  the electroactive species and to control the structure
              and  electronic properties of the medium through which electron  transfer
              occurs.  The work supported here uses this approach to  examine the structural
              origins of the rates of charge transfer  across interfaces.  Knowledge in this
              area is crucial to  understanding the mechanisms of biological membrane charge 
              transfer, and in the development of new sensing and display  technologies.  The
              work supported here will contribute to the  development of this understanding.
