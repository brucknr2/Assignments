Abstract    :
              9412479  Hicks  The first nucleon resonance will be studied in carbon via 
              photoproduction using linearly polarized gamma rays at the Laser  Electron
              Gamma Source at Brookhaven National Lab.  Decay of the  resonance into a pion
              and nucleon will be observed.  A related  measurement will be carried out at
              the TRIUMF lab in Canada using  polarized protons to excite the resonance.  The
              objective is to  study the effect of the nuclear medium on the fundamental
              nucleon  resonance.  An experiment will be initiated at CEBAF to study 
              electroproduction of hyperons.  The objective here is to  constrain
              constituent-quark models of these resonances  ***
