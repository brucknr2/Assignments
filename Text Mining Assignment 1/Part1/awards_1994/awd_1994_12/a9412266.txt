Abstract    :
              9412266  Overman  The focus of this research will be on the synthesis of 
              stereochemically complex oxygen and nitrogen heterocycles by  new cyclization
              methods and on the development of a general  method for asymmetric catalysis of
               3,3 -sigmatropic  rearrangements.  Five marine natural products, ptilomycalin
              A,  crambescidin 800, isocrambescidin 800, manzamine A and  (E)-pinnatifidenyne
              are the specific synthetic targets.  %%%  With this renewal award, the
              Synthetic Organic Program is  supporting the research of Dr. Larry E. Overman
              of the  Department of Chemistry at the University of California,  Irvine. 
              Professor Overman will focus his work on the  development of economical methods
              for the synthesis of complex  organic molecules.  The approach is expected to
              impact the  discovery, development and production components of the 
              pharmaceutical, agricultural and materials industries.  ***
