Abstract    :
              9412481  Golden  This Americas Program award will  support travel and related 
              expenses for two US. scientists and four US. students for a  collaborative
              research project between the Center for  Materials Characterization (CMC) at
              the University of North  Texas and the Instituto Tecnologico de Saltillo (ITS),
               Mexico.  The group will study and correlate chemical  analyses, structure, and
              corrosion resistance of films  formed by electrode-less deposition. 
              Preparation of  samples, X-ray diffraction, and mechanical testing will be 
              carried out at the ITS facilities in Saltillo, Mexico. Auger  electron
              spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,  scanning electron,
              transmission electron, and scanning  tunneling microscopy will be done at CMC
              in Denton, Texas.    This study is likely to lead to the development of better 
              corrosion resistant coatings and improved understanding of  the relationship of
              properties to performance. The project  will also serve to provide an
              international experience to  graduate students through the sharing of
              facilities and  research environments in both countries.  ***
