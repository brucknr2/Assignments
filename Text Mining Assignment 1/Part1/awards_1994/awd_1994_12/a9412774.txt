Abstract    :
              With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program Professor Turacek of the  
              University of Washington will study by the use of a tandem mass   spectrometer
              the behavior of hypervalent radicals. Organic heteroatom   molecules containing
              oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur will be   used to generate hypervalent
              radicals formed by femtosecond electron   transfer in the gas phase.  Four
              aspects of the hypervalent radicals will   be studied. They are: (1)
              photochemistry; (2) probing protonation sites   by radical dissociations;  (3)
              intramolecular electron transfer;  and (4)   hydrogen atom transfer.    Novel
              carbon containing molecules that may also contain sulfur, nitrogen,  
              phosphorus, or oxygen will be subjected to high energy electromagnetic  
              radiation to prepare species with very short lifetimes and unusual   electron
              arrangements. The behavior of these species in the gas phase   will be measured
              by a mass spectrometer of unique design. Theoretical   computations will be
              used to simulate the data acquired from the   experiments. These results will
              help define what variables must be   modified for computational experiments
              using high performance computers.
