Abstract    :
              9412016  Sniderman    This project continues research on behalf of a study aimed
              at  identifying and overcoming barriers to electing African American 
              candidates for Congress in majority-white districts.  The  principal portion of
              the study concentrates on the reactions of  voters to African   American
              candidates for Congress in white-majority districts and  this continuing
              project provides for interviews with  approximately 250 African Americans to
              add to the 500 already in  the study.  Combining the two provides a sample of
              sufficient  size to permit the analysis of the views, concerns, aspirations 
              and values of African Americans, not simply as a convenient  contrast with
              those of white Americans, but in their own right  and in detail.  The study
              thus enables the investigators to  explore issues of race not only from the
              perspective of whites  but from that of African Americans.
