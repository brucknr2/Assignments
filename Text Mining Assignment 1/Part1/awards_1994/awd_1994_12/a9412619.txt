Abstract    :
              941261  Turner       This project enables the principal investigator to serve a 
              period of internship with a CAD vendor as a software engineer.  The  internship
              period will be the starting point for new efforts by the  Principal
              Investigator in researching and proposing appropriate  software paradigms and
              conceptual abstractions that will lead to  more productive software development
              efforts in the manufacturing  sector and in the CAD vendor community.       The
              long-term objective of the research is to develop new  softwear paradigms for
              computer aided design (CAD) by building a  sound base of software engineering
              technology that embraces the new  user-oriented approach to applications
              development, and frees the  programmer from much of the current procedural
              detail which he or  she must master.
