Abstract    :
              9412561  A soap film is proposed as the simplest physical system which 
              possesses icosahedral symmetry.  Numerical construction of such a  surface with
              constant mean curvature is expected to advance our  understanding of the
              quasicrystalline state.  This approach will  test the universality of tiling
              description in quasicrystals.  %%%  The proposed work is to obtain a new way to
              to understand the  quasicrystals without tiles.  This will be achieved by
              numerically  constructing surfaces such as soap films which exhibit icosahedral
               symmetry.  This research will test universality of the tiling  description.
