Abstract    :
              9412825  Frangopol  A 2  day workshop on "reliability Incorporation in Highway
              Bridge  Engineering" is proposed for August 1995, in boulder, Colorado.  The
              workshop will include modern concepts and methods in  structural reliability
              and their role in the development of the  new load and resistance factor design
              (LRFD) code for highway  bridges.  Also, reliability-based requirements for
              inspection of  bridges will be developed, maintenance strategies for assurance 
              of high bridge safety will be explored, and methods for  optimization of bridge
              maintenance programs will be outlined.  Finally, on going research results in
              bridge load models,  deterioration models, and the integration of
              reliability-based  assessments in bridge management systems will be discussed. 
                This workshop will provide transfer of information on modern  reliability
              technology to state highway officials, state bridge  engineers, bridge
              inspectors, bridge designers, and bridge  maintenance personnel.  It will
              provide a unique forum and  opportunity to individuals who manage the U.S.
              bridge  infrastructure system, to better understand and apply modern 
              reliability concepts and methods in highway bridge engineering.  The documents
              of this workshop will be widely distributed  throughout the United States to
              all Departments of  Transportation, highway bridge officials and practicing
              bridge  engineers.  ***
