Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9412687  California State University-Long Beach  P. I.:  Hamid
              Hefazi      Under the auspices of the Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison
              with Industry - Engineering Faculty Internships Program, It is proposed that
              the PI work with an industrial partner to develop computational tools.  A
              numerical optimization procedure coupled with a computational fluid dynamics
              analysis will be used to maximize the efficiency of a supersonic impulse
              turbine blade.  The results of this project will provide the industrial
              partner, Allied Signal, a tool to markedly improve their design procedures. 
              This project will bring modern computational techniques to bear on industrial
              problems.  In turn, students will benefit from contact with the industrial
              sponsor and enhancement of existing courses due to industrial input.
