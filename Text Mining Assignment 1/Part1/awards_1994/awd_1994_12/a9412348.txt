Abstract    :
              9412348  Thomas  The Microelectronics Research Center of the Georgia Institute
              of Technology proposes to upgrade an existing ATOMIKA SIMS analytical system
              through new electronic and computer packages. These upgrades will provide for
              the first time three dimensional mapping of elemental distributions, render the
              system user-friendly for student initiated projects, and provide facilities for
              remote analysis of data on standard office computers.  The enhanced system will
              support several projects in Electrical and Materials Engineering as well as in
              the multidisciplinary Microelectronics Research Center.  In particular the
              equipment will used for study of materials for high efficiency solar voltaic
              cells, and High Definition TV imager chips.  ***
