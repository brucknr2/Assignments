Abstract    :
              9412448  Reddy       This workshop addresses one of the problems associated with
               environmentally conscious manufacturing, namely, the availability  of data. 
              It will be a forum to enable an international consortium  of universities to
              plan the creation of a global knowledge network  to facilitate world-wide
              sharing of information needed for  designing and developing environmentally
              sound products.       The global design community has a need for access to this
               data.  All developed countries have significant problems in the  environmental
              area and developing countries can see the signs of  problems already.  This
              workshop will contribute to making it  possible to any product developer in the
              world to explore models  and information related to product, process, material,
              and  deployment alternatives that will have the least impact on the 
              environment.
