Abstract    :
              INT-9412801  Crawford  This project supports the continued participation of Dr.
              Tadesse  Mesfin of Addis Ababa University, Ethiopia, in an ongoing study in 
              plant molecular phylogenetics, led by Dr. Daniel Crawford of Ohio  State
              University, (NSF Grant INT-9025030), of the systematics and  evolution of the
              genus Coreopsis (Asteraceae).  Both South America  and Eastern Africa represent
              centers of diversity for Coreopsis  that equal or surpass that found in North
              America.  The  collaborative component with the Ethiopian partner is 
              investigating the relationship of North American Coreopsis to  African plants
              that have been variously assigned to Bidens or  Coreopsis.    During this
              extension of his research cooperation at Ohio State,  the Ethiopian scientist
              will pursue the following goals:  (1) make  further morphological and
              anatomical studies on particularly South  American species of Coreopsis and
              selected North and South  American species of Bidens; (2) continue the search
              for diagnostic  features in Bidens and Coreopsis from particularly reproductive
               features; (3) complete the description of the remaining species of  North
              American species of Coreopsis (27 of the 44 species have  been described and
              sketched so far); (4) produce a scheme that  reveals the relationships between
              Bidens and Coreopsis in the Old  versus the New World taxa. The visiting
              scientist is gaining  familiarity with additional techniques and methods, such
              as enzyme  electrophoresis, how to study DNA for systematic purposes, using 
              cladistics for generating phylogenies, etc.  When he returns to  Ethiopia, he
              will be able to instruct students in these aspects of  systematics. Improved
              understanding of this large, widespread  genus is consistent with the Africa
              program's emphasis on  biodiversity research cooperation, and promises benefits
              to both  partners and to their parent institutions.  Moreover, this project 
              will contribute to the establishment of a longterm research  network linking
              scientists on three continents, Af rica, North  America, and South America.
