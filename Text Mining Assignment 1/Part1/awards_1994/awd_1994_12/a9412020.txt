Abstract    :
              9412020  Wise  The School of Applied and Engineering Physics at Cornell
              University will purchase a titanium:sapphire regenerative amplifier laser
              system which will be dedicated to support research in engineering.  The laser
              system will be used for a variety of research projects, which will include: 
              the study of the electronic, optical and vibrational properties of IV-VI
              semiconductor nanocrystals; characterization of the nonlinear response of
              glasses to femtosecond laser pulses; studies to determine the underlying
              origins of supercontinuum generation; and optical phase conjugation of
              femtosecond laser pulses by stimulated librational scattering.  ***
