Abstract    :
                            9412381  Knauft / Wardlow       This project involves the
              dissertation research of an  anthropology student from Emory University.  The
              student  will study the socio-cultural repercussions of sexually  transmitted
              diseases (STDs) in a tribal society of Papua New  Guinea.  The project will
              focus on how women in this society  use this disease category to gain moral
              social status, by  accusing men of spreading the disease.  Using in-depth 
              interviews with two samples of women, 50 who reported STD  and 50 women who
              have not, the project will analyze women's  choices, rhetoric, and social
              status.  In addition the  project will analyze data from records of clinics on
              the  prevalence of STDs.        This research is important because it will
              provide a  valuable case study of the impact of STDs on a tribal  population. 
              By studying the variations in how diseases  impact on women's lives and how
              women use the existence of  STDs to negotiate for more autonomy and social
              status, the  project will advance our understanding of gender relations  in
              traditional societies and of the cultural interpretations  of STDs.
              Improvements in our knowledge of how people  interpret the meaning of STDs is a
              necessary step towards  designing interventions that work to control the
              diseases.
