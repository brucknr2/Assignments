Abstract    :
              9412260  Furlong    This grant is to support a workshop of the Coordinating 
              Organization for Northern California Earthquake Research and  Technology
              (CONCERT) which is composed of the principal government,  university and
              industry researchers in the fields of seismology,  tectonophysics, geodynamics,
              structural geology, and geomorphology  in northern California.  The subject of
              the workshop is an  integrative model of the present tectonic setting and an
              assessment  of the implications for earthquake genesis and hazards in the 
              region.  A paper outlining the results of the workshop will be  published. 
              Approximately 100 professionals and regional press  representatives are
              expected to attend the workshop scheduled for  Menlo Park, California, on April
              18-20, 1994.  This research is a  component of the National Earthquake Hazard
              Reduction Program.  ***
