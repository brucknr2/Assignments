Abstract    :
              9412354  Scranton    The  Departments of Chemical Engineering and Chemistry at
              Michigan State University  will purchase FTIR equipment that will be dedicated
              to research in engineering.  The equipment will be used for several research
              projects, including in particular, high-speed FTIR studies of cationic
              photopolymerizations, controlling polymer structure and morphology for photonic
              switching applications and structural characterization of a high performance
              organic interfacial system.  ***
