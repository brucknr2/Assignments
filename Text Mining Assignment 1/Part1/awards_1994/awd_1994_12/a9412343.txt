Abstract    :
              9412343  Fourer       This objective of this research is to establish a
              dedicated  computing facility for investigating a variety of large scale 
              optimization problems using parallel processor environment.  The  classes of
              problems under consideration are combinatorial in  nature.  The equipment
              obtained as part of the research will be  used by multiple researchers to
              develop optimization algorithms  that can be implemented in a parallel
              processor network to reduce  the taken required to solve large scale
              optimization problems.  The  class of problems to which the multi-processor
              platform will be  used under this study include (1) alternative to direct
              solution of  the normal equations in interior-point methods for linear 
              programming, (2) difficult discrete optimization problems using  cutting plan
              methods, and (3) vehicle routing problems.       The facility will enable the
              development of new optimization  algorithms and exploitation opportunities for
              multi-processor  optimization environment.  The feasible demonstration of
              parallel  processor for solving large scale optimization problems can lead to 
              technology that offers tremendous opportunity in reducing both  computational
              and storage facility requirements.  The technology  can also be readily
              transferred to other users and industry.
