Abstract    :
              9412340  Isidori       The design of feedback laws for systems characterized by 
              complicated nonlinear dynamical behavior is challenging research  task which
              has attracted an increasing interest in recent years.   Advances in nonlinear
              control theory will substantially improve  the design of control systems for
              light-weighted robot arms, for  autopilots and guidance systems of highly
              maneuverable aircrafts,  increase the flexibility and energy efficiency in the
              regulation  of chemical plants, facilitate the real-time reconfiguration of a 
              control system after the occurrence of a failure.         Among the many
              problems which must be confronted, a most  important one is the design of
              feedback laws achieving a  prescribed performance objective, usually expressed
              in terms of  the response to a prescribed set of command inputs for the 
              control of a physical system in the presence of substantial model 
              uncertainties.          A methodology which, in the case of linear systems, has
               proven very effective in the design of robust controllers in the  presence of
              unstructured perturbations, is that based on the  minimization of the maximal
              amplitude of the frequency response  to exogenous disturbance inputs.  The
              purpose of this research is  to contribute to the extension of this design
              methodology to  nonlinear systems and to show how this can be effectively used
              to  address a number of relevant problems which arise in the design  of
              nonlinear feedback laws achieving robust performance.  ***
