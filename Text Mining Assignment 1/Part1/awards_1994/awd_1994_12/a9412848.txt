Abstract    :
              This study is a theoretical investigation of the self-focusing  instability
              driven by high power radio waves in the ionosphere.   Self focusing results
              from localized changes in ionospheric  properties produced when a high power
              radio wave at certain  frequencies is transmitted into the ionosphere.  Self
              focusing  describes the tendency for the radio waves to be focused by the 
              resulting spatial variations.  The goal of the study is to  understand the role
              of non-ideal effects present in the  experimental configuration.  These include
              density inhomogeneities,  finite pump size, plasma flow, and the irregular
              speckle patter of  the beam intensity.  Analytical and numerical techniques
              will be  used to study the nonlinear evolution of the self-focusing 
              instability in the presence of coherent structures or random  inhomogeneities
              in two and three dimensions.  The computational  results will be compared with
              available experimental data and will  be used to plan future ionospheric
              modification experiments.  The  results will improve our fundamental
              understanding of a basic  physical process that occurs when high power
              radiowaves propagate  through collisional or collisionless plasmas.
