Abstract    :
              Konza Prairie Research Natural Area (KPRNA) is a 3,487 ha.  tallgrass prairie
              preserve 15km south of the Kansas State  University campus that is owned by The
              Nature Conservancy  and managed by the Division of Biology.  Over 80 projects, 
              involving 14 Departments and 5 colleges on campus and dozens  of researchers
              from off campus, are being conducted on the  site, with current extramural
              funding of almost $6,000,000.  Current facilities include a large stone ranch
              house and  barn, a small laboratory, 30 km of fencing, 17 km of  maintained
              gravel roads, a 16.4 km bison enclosures and  bison handling facility, and fire
              management equipment for  the experimental burn treatments imposed on the site
              (which  requires 61 km of maintained fire guards).  Over 90% of the  research
              on the site resolves around the bison or fire  experimental manipulations, or
              the 5,000 ft2 behavioral  research facility in the loft of the barn.  Research
              on  KPRNA has grown significantly in the last decade and the  site has reached
              its carrying capacity with the current  facilities.  Therefore, KPRNA has
              embarked on a three phase  development plan that includes I) producing a long
              range  Master Plan, II) stabilizing and renovating the existing  facilities and
              equipment, and III) constructing a new  laboratory and living quarters for
              visiting scientists.    This proposal is to complete Phase II - specifically,
              to  construct new bison handling facilities, upgrade our fire  management
              capabilities, and to renovate an existing  behavioral research space.  The new
              facilities will allow  effective and safe handling of the bison, and the fire 
              management equipment will enhance our ability to conduct  prescribed burns and
              fight unwanted fires.  The behavioral  research facility will be renovated with
              new support columns  for the loft and new flooring.  Concurrently, matching
              funds  will be used to upgrade the other equipment and facilities  on the site,
              especially the stone house, which is used by  scientists for offices, sleeping
              qu arters, and meeting  areas.  The completion of Phase II is critical to
              increasing  research capacity, and allowing a move to the next level of 
              development and productivity.
