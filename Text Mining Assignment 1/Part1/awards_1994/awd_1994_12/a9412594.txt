Abstract    :
                       The Science and Technology Center for Discrete Mathematics and
              Theoretical  Computer Science (DIMACS) will hold a special year program in
              Mathematical  Support for Molecular Biology.  This award will help support the
              activities planned  for the special year.  In particular, the program will
              feature a series of several focused  workshops and a number of exploratory
              mini-workshops, an algorithm implementation  challenge, a visitor program, and
              a postdoctoral training program.  The special year  will explore the uses of
              the methods of discrete mathematics and theoretical computer  science in the
              solution of problems of molecular biology.  It will involve leaders and 
              outstanding junior researchers in the mathematical sciences in the solution of
              problems  of interest to and formulated with the help of biologists, will give
              focus to the  developing community of mathematical/computational molecular
              biologists, will  engage biologists in a primary role in defining the agenda of
               mathematical/computational molecular biology, and will establish long-term 
              partnerships between mathematical scientists and biological scientists.  This
              award is  being funded by several programs within NSF:  Theory of Computing,
              Algebra and  Number Theory, Applied Mathematics, and Computational Biology.
