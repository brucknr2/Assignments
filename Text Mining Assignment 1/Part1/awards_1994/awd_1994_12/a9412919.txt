Abstract    :
              9412919  Sampath       The goal of this research is to investigate the effects
              of  process parameters (deposition rate and ambient pressure) on the 
              properties, grain size and electrical conductivity, of thin films.   The
              methodology of statistical design of experiments will be  applied to the
              development of the experimental plan and the  analysis of results.       Thin
              films are widely used in many applications, including  photovoltaic devices. 
              Thin films are deposited in industry by wet  chemical methods and vacuum
              processes.  The vacuum deposition  method produces thin films of superior
              quality and generates little  or no hazardous waste.  However, the major
              disadvantage is the low  throughput associated with batch processing in vacuum.
               This  research will seek to deposit CdS and CdTe thin films using an air- 
              vacuum-air process that is environmentally benign.
