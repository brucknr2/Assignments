Abstract    :
              9412237  Wine              This four year program will involve continuing
              research aimed  at elucidating the kinetics and reaction mechanisms which
              control  the atmospheric oxidation of sulfur compounds, with particular 
              emphasis oxidation pathways for dimethylsulfide (CH3 \SCH3, DMS).   The goals
              of the program is the definitive determination of the  rates and mechanisms for
              conversion of reduced sulfur compounds to  relatively stable S(IV and S(VI) and
              products such as sulfur  dioxide (SO2), sulfuric acid (H2S04), sulfoxides,
              sulfones and  sulfonic acids.  Direct, "real time" observations of reactive 
              intermediates and stable end products is emphasized because only  through such
              observations can results with a unique interpretation  be obtained.  The
              research will contribute significantly to our  understanding of the global
              sulfur cycle, thus facilitating  accurate assessment of the contribution of
              both biogenic and  anthropogenic sulfur to such problems as climate
              modification (or  regulation), visibility reduction, and acid precipitation.  
              Specific experimental investigations will focus on DMS, DMS  adducts, DMSO
              (CH3SOCH3), carbonyl sulfide (OCS), and S03 H2)  adducts.         The
              experimental methodology will involve coupling radical  generation by laser
              flash photolysis with a number of time-resolved  detection techniques including
              pulsed laser induced fluorescence,  atomic resonance fluorescence, UV-visible
              absorption using both  incoherent and laser light sources, infrared tunable
              diode laser  absorption, photoionization mass spectrometry, and resonance 
              enhanced multiphoton ionization mass spectrometry.  In these  mechanistic
              studies, th ability to obtain time-resolved data on 10-  7-10-3 s time scales
              is critical to defining the detailed reaction  sequences leading to product
              formation.         The investigators will, of course, keep abreast of progress
              in  other laboratories and new developments in the area of tropospheric 
              chemistry, and may alter their sub-tasks somewhat to accomm odate  newly
              identified research needs.   ***
