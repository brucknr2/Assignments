Abstract    :
              9412349  Langari       The award is for the purchase of components of an
              experimental  setup which will be capable of micromotions and which will be
              used  to support research in engineering.  The equipment includes linear 
              actuators, a laser doppler velocimeter, force transducer, acoustic  emission
              sensor, and digital signal processor based data  acquisition and control
              equipment, along with an optical bread  board and custom built accessories.    
                The equipment will be used for research involving development  of accurate
              models of friction-induced dynamics at low velocities  and development of
              effective control strategies to deal with  friction-induced dynamics at low
              velocities and in micro-  positioning situations.  The better understanding of
              friction and  its control would be of help in many manufacturing applications 
              involving precise motion control.
