Abstract    :
               The proposal was submitted in response to the REG Program Announcement and
              requested support to purchase a high speed, high resolution video system to be
              shared by several investigators.  The primary use of this system would be for
              the simultaneous measurement of temperature and heat transfer in microscale
              environments with rapid transients.  Utilizing laser induced fluorescence of
              rare earth doped thermographic phosphors, a novel imaging technique has already
              been developed that is capable of measuring temperatures from 0 to 250 C with
              10 micron spatial resolution and 0.5 C accuracy.  With the acquisition of the
              proposed system, which has a rate of 12,000 frame/sec and on board DRAM
              storage, the upgraded system would permit the measurements of highly unsteady
              phenomena and could significantly advance the understanding of these flows.
