Abstract    :
              9412798  Pancake  This proposal requests support for academic participation at
              the first General Meeting of the Parallel Tools Consortium, to be held in early
              June of 1994.  In addition to general discussions of the Consortium's goals,
              directions, and projects, the 2.5-day meeting will include a series of breakout
              sessions where joint tool projects will serve as the impetus for structured
              dialogue between tool developers and tool users.
