Abstract    :
              9412313  Bromberg       This grant supports a program of research in elementary-
               particle physics with the inrernational collaboration CDF  that studies
              properties of proton-antiproton interactions  produced in the Fermilab
              colliding-beams accelerator  complex.  Topics of interest include fundamental
              quark,  lepton and vector-boson properties, and tests of predictions  made
              within the standard-model theoretical framework.  Included is support for
              further development of data  acquisition with fiber optics to improve the
              capability of  the complex CDF detection apparatus.  ***
