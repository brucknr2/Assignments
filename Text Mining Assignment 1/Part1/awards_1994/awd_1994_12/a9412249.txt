Abstract    :
              9412249  Shuler  This project is on research to improve protein production and 
              processing in insect cells through four goals: (1) the design of  cells that
              are more capable of complete processing; (2) the  development of improved media
              which mimics in vivo conditions;  (3) the determination of cell culture
              conditions that alter  intracellular protein processing; and (4) the
              development of  improved expression vectors.  This research could produce more 
              efficient methods to produce therapeutic proteins.
