                     The 12th International Congress of the International Union  for the
              Study of Social Insects will be held from 21 to 27  August 1994 in Paris,
              France.  This Congress, held once  every four or five years, is the premier
              world forum for  research on social insects.  It is the only meeting devoted 
              to this important group of organisms.  Support from the  National Science
              Foundation will permit participation by  young American scientists who might
              not otherwise be able to  attend this meeting, with its opportunities for
              exchange of  information and for establishment of international  collaborations
              in research.
