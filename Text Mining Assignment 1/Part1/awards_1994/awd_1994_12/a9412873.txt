Abstract    :
              This project seeks to tap the vast amount of latent mathematical ability in the
              young people of  America.  Its goal is to expose students in these critical
              years to mathematics as practiced by  professionals and to empower them with a
              feeling that useful information can be gleaned from  the simplest of models. 
              Interacting with these professionals, seeing their lifestyles and work  habits,
              becoming involved with the same problems, will yield a much more accurate
              picture of  careers in the mathematical sciences in the rewards, both
              intellectual and financial, that they  bring.  It is also necessary to involve
              instructors of the mathematical sciences in this adventure  because it is they
              who will transmit the excitement and importance of mathematics and science  on
              a day-to-day basis.
