Abstract    :
              9412736  Wilson  Rice University  Drs. Lon J. Wilson, Chemistry Department, Rice
              University, and David M. Stanbury, Chemistry Department, Auburn University, are
              supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
              of the Chemistry Division for a study of the redox properties and electron
              transfer kinetics of copper coordination compounds in which the coordination
              number of the metal does not change during oxidation or reduction. A series of
              coordination number invariant (CNI) complexes in which the copper  is 6, 5, 4,
              or 3 coordinate will be prepared and characterized by     Wilson. Kinetic
              studies will then be undertaken by Stanbury to determine self-exchange rates
              and activation parameters for outer sphere electron transfer involving these
              complexes. A combination of the structural, energetic, and kinetic results will
              lead to an understanding of the factors which influence electron transfer in
              copper complexes.    Copper ions in metalloproteins play important roles in
              most living organisms. Prominent among these is the facilitation of electron
              transport within biological systems. In this study the factors which control
              the rate of electron transfer between adjacent copper centers will be assessed.
              Specifically, the rigidity of the environment around a copper may play an
              important role in fixing this rate and the importance of this effect will be
              evaluated by examining electron transfer in copper compounds which do not
              undergo large structural changes when electrons are added or removed from the
              metal. The ultimate objective is a complete understanding of the electron
              transfer processes which occur in copper containing proteins.
