Abstract    :
                This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              will assist the  Department of Chemistry at the Northwestern University in the
              purchase of a distributed  memory parallel computer.  This equipment will
              enhance research in a number of areas  including the following:  parallelized
              local-density and density functional electronic structure  calculations,
              parallel scattering calculations, dynamical mean-field studies and molecular 
              dynamics calculations.    A workstation network of fast, modern computer
              workstations is a new way to satisfy the  computing needs of chemistry
              departments.  Such a "computer network" also serves as a  development
              environment for new theoretical codes and algorithms, and provides
              state-of-the-art  graphics and visualization facilities.
