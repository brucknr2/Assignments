Abstract    :
              9412393  Mileti  This  award  is  for  renewed support  for  the  Natural 
              Hazards  Research and Applications Information Center at the University of 
              Colorado.  The Center monitors and disseminates hazards  research  information 
              to  multiple  users: administrators,  practitioners,  policy  makers,
              engineers, and scientists.  The Center  publishes  and  distributes  the 
              Natural Hazards Observer  to  over  12,200  subscribers  six times a year;
              operates an electronic newsletter,  Disaster   Research;   publishes 
              monographs,   working   papers,  bibliographies,  and special publications.  It
               holds  an  annual  workshop  involving  users  and  producers  of  hazards 
              research  results,  and  it provides information on a day-to-day  basis  in 
              response  to  inquiries.   The Center  conducts  modest  research  activities 
              relating to societal response to natural hazards  and  it  supports researchers
              throughout the nation as they carry  out  quick-response  studies of specific
              disasters.   In  addition  to  NSF,  funds for this award are also being
              provided by FEMA, NOAA,  EPA, NIMH, USGS, and the Corps of Engineers.  ***
