Abstract    :
              9412936  Macrina  The American Academy of Microbiology will convene a colloquium
              of  leading scientists and scholars to deliberate on a critical issue  relating
              to scientific integrity:  collaborative research.  At this  working meeting, 15
              participants will work together to identify,  analyze and develop
              recommendations on such issues as:  defining  contributions and authorship;
              responsibilities of individual  researchers in collaborative relationships;
              intellectual property  ownership; accountability and quality assurance issues;
              and  monitoring.  A white paper with an in-depth analysis and  recommendations
              will be developed and disseminated to individuals  involved in teaching issues
              in scientific integrity, to the broad  microbiological community, to policy
              makers who have concerns about  collaborative scientific research, and to the
              public.  Prior  meetings have provided the opportunity to describe relevant
              issues,  but have provided little analysis and guidance.  This colloquium  will
              focus on this very specific area in order to explore and  develop the issues in
              depth.  The report from this treatment will  be useful to scientists and
              instructors in defining, refining, and  developing their courses in scientific
              integrity.  It will also  assist the lay public in understanding the issues
              surrounding  research collaborations.  ***
