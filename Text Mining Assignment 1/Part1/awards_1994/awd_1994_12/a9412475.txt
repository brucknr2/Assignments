Abstract    :
              9412475 Carey  Grid refinement-solution is a key problem area and critical
              "bottleneck" to semiconductor device and process simulation (e.g. see the
              Semiconductor Industry Association  Roadmap, 1993).  The open issues range from
              he basic questions of efficient generation of unstructured adaptive 2D and 3D
              grids, to reliable error indicators and enhanced solution techniques that
              exploit the grid.  The present research builds on the investigators' previous
              experience in adaptive grids to focus on the grid problem for semiconductor
              technology CAD. There are five main thrusts to the grid research for
              semiconductor problems:  1. Two and three-dimensional unstructured and moving 
              grids for semiconductor  device and process applications:  2. Quadtree/octree
              data structures and adaptive refinement/redistribution;  3. A posteriori error
              analyses and error indicators for refinement and reliability  calculation in
              the device and process problems;  4. Refinement-Solution strategies to exploit
              the evolving grid and enhance  computational efficiency;  5. Benchmark studies
              and application to representative device and process problems.
