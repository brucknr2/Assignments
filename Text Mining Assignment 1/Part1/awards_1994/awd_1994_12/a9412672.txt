Abstract    :
              9412672  This renewal proposal will focus on transport properties of type  II
              superconductors using generalized semiclassical methods and  will develop
              bosonization approach to study strongly correlated  systems.  The motivation
              for the study of transport properties  is to understand the anomalous resistive
              characteristics in  high temperature superconductors.  The bosonization
              approach  is a nonperturbative way to study exotic properties of  non-Fermi
              liquid ground states.  The method is applicable to  dimensions greater than
              one.  %%%  The proposed work will be to study strongly correlated systems 
              using generalized semiclassical methods and bosonization approach. 
              Semiclassical methods will be used to study transport properties  of type II
              superconductors in magnetic field with the motivation  to explain anomalous
              resistive characteristics.  Bosonization  method will provide better
              understanding of the complicated ground  state properties of strongly
              correlated systems.
