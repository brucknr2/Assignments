Abstract    :
              9412952  Brown  Ohio State University requests support from NSF for the
              connection  of Ohio Dominican College to the Ohio Academic Resources Network 
              (OARnet) which is the NSF mid-level network that serves the State  of Ohio.  A
              primary goal of OARnet is to facilitate collaborative  projects and sharing of
              resources between institutions, including  those outside the state.    OARnet
              will provide operations management and information services  and it will give
              the school a 56 thousand bit per second connection  to the NSFNET, a high speed
              (1.5 - 45 million bits per second)  National Backbone network.    The school
              needs greater functionality and network speed to be able  to access
              supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers along  with being able to
              implement a more reliable mail system.  Students  and faculty research will
              benefit from the link.  This is also a  unique opportunity for the schools to
              explore innovative  educational resources.
