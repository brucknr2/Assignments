Abstract    :
              9412684  McGeary         A deep multichannel seismic reflection survey of the
              Aleutian  arc and the extensive Alaskina continental shelf will delineate and 
              differentiate arc magmatism and terrain accretion. The high-quality  images of
              the deep structure of the crust and uppermost mantle,  when combined with the
              well-mapped onshore geology, should allow  the principal investigators to
              constrain the mechanisms of  accretion and magmatism.
