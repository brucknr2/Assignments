Abstract    :
              9412377  ROGERSON       This project will investigate intergenerational
              relations in  the U.S. be focusing on living arrangements of elderly persons 
              and their geographic proximity to their adult children.  Proximity and living
              arrangements are often critical in  determining access to caregiving and
              support among members of  each generation.  Increased life expectancy, the
              aging of the  baby boom generation, and small family sizes suggest a need to 
              further understand these dimensions of family behavior.  Employing panel data
              from the 1988 and 1993 National Surveys of  Families and Households, static
              models as well as transition  models will be analyzed to capture a fuller
              picture of the living  arrangements and proximity between adult children and
              their  parents during the study period.  A rational choice perspective  will be
              utilized to develop and test models of: (1) the choices  of living arrangements
              of elderly persons, (2) the structure  of  hierarchical relationships among
              living arrangement alternatives,  and (c) changes in individual living
              arrangement choices.  Finally models of intergenerational accessibility will be
               developed, including the establishment of a proximity/living  arrangement
              typology and an evaluation of transitions in family  accessibility states.     
               This project will contribute to theoretical understanding of 
              intergenerational relations from both a geographical and a  sociological
              perspective.  The results of the study will also  have important implications
              for our understanding of the future  well-being of an aging population.  The
              research will be  conducted by an interdisciplinary team that will construct a 
              better synthesis of this important phenomenon.
