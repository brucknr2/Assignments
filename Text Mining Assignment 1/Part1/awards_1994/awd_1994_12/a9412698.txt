Abstract    :
               This project investigates the design, implementation,   analysis of algorithms
              for several problems that arise in    the solution of  large, sparse systems of
              equations and least  squares   problems on  high-performance parallel
              computers.  The irregular nature of   the memory access  required by sparse 
              matrix algorithms makes good performance   difficult to  achieve.  Innovative
              algorithmic approaches capable of better   concurrency than the traditional
              sequential approaches, and    implementations that exploit the memory hierarchy
               are   essential to obtain good  performance.    The following problems are
              being   investigated:  (1) An algebraic approach to the partitioning problem
              that   arises  in partitioning  data and computation on parallel computers, and
               in computing   nested dissection orderings,  (2) The problem of reordering
              sparse matrices to minimize   with applications to computing incomplete
              factorization    (3) The product-form-inverse approach to the solution of  
              sparse  triangular systems on parallel computers,  (4) The  solution of
              rank-deficient least-squares problems on    sequential and parallel computers.
