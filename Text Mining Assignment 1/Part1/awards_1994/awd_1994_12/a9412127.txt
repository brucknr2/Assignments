Abstract    :
              9412127  Andersen    Mary Baldwin College requests support from NSF for
              connection of  its campus network to VERnet.  VERnet is the midlevel network 
              located in the state of Virginia.  VERnet will provide operations  management
              and information services and it will give Mary Baldwin  College connectivity
              with the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45  million bits per second) National
              Backbone network.    The College needs greater functionality and network speed
              to be  able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers  along
              with being able to implement a more reliable mail system.   Students and
              faculty research will benefit from the link.  This is  also a unique
              opportunity for the school to explore innovative  educational resources.
