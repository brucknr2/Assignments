Abstract    :
              9412556  Stack       Research will be conducted in theoretical elementary 
              particle physics.  The primary purpose of this work will be to  gain a physical
              understanding of how quarks are confined inside  nuclear particles or hadrons. 
              Quantum chromodynamics is the  theory describing quarks and their interactions,
              and the proposed  work will involve supercomputer simulations of quantum 
              chromodynamics.  These simulations provide data unobtainable by  other means,
              which can be used to provide a physical picture of  the forces confining
              quarks.  The forces underlie all the  phenomena of nuclear physics, and rank in
              importance with the  more familiar forces of gravity and electromagnetism.  ***
