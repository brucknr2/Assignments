Abstract    :
              9412966  Arno  The overall objectives of this research are to explore the 
              relationship between the public and private sectors in biomedical  research, to
              determine its impact on the public interest and to  identify reforms that will
              bolster that interest.  In this current  effort, the investigators and working
              group will develop and  critique several initial papers:  one will explore the
              concept of  the public interest, and one will provide a bibliographic essay 
              examining the relevant literatures and available data that future  research
              could use to answer questions about the current status and  directions of
              cooperative relationships between industry and  university with respect to
              biomedical research, impacts of these  relationships on the public interest and
              conflicts of interest,  implications of exclusive licensing, tax and trade
              policy for  commercial benefit and for university industry relationships, and 
              the impacts of all of these developments on university culture and  the public
              interest.  Results will be presented at meetings and in  other forums,
              published, and used to prepare future research  proposals on these topics.
