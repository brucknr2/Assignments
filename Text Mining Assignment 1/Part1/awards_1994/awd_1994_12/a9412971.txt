Abstract    :
              9412971  Poeppelmeier  The primary focus of this research is to develop the
              concept of  salt imbibition for the purpose of generating new synthetic methods
               and chemical reactions that lead to novel precursors for high  surface area
              mixed metal oxides that are catalytically active.  An  emphasis will be on
              transforming the precursors at low temperatures  to mixed metal oxides,
              characterizing the solid-state products, and  studying the nature of acidic and
              basic sites at the surface and  their role on surface reactivity.  %%%  The
              synthesis and characterization of new materials is one of the  major forces in
              science that causes change and leads to advances in  technology.  Solid-state
              chemical approaches to generating novel  catalytic materials such as the high
              surface area metal oxides that  are the subject of this research are offering
              new applications in  emerging areas of heterogeneous catalysis.
