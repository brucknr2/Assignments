Abstract    :
                A request has been made for funding to help offset the costs of travel of
              invited speakers from Eastern Europe and Russia, graduate student (USA) travel,
              and publication costs in conjunction with the 12th International Symposium on
              Plasma Chemistry (ISPC 12) to be held at the University of Minnesota on August
              21-26, 1995.  The ISPC serves as the primary international forum for
              researchers in the areas of plasma chemistry and plasma processing.  Topics
              ranging from the basic physics and chemistry of discharges to the modeling of
              industrial plasma processing and techniques will be covered.  It is expected
              that the conference will attract 500-700 participants, with representation from
              academia, industry, and government laboratories.  A strong effort is planned to
              attract researchers from Eastern Europe and Russia.  To that end a special
              workshop will be organized which will highlight research areas in which they
              are in the forefront.  This particular aspect of the meeting makes it
              especially attractive since the U.S. stands to gain much from such an
              interchange.  Special arrangements will also be made to encourage graduate
              student attendance by having reduced registration and inexpensive dormitory
              lodgings and partial travel support available to them.
