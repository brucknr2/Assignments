Abstract    :
                   The eastern North Pacific, just west of the Sierra Madre  Mountains,
              experiences a high incidence of tropical cyclone  formation.  The initial
              location of the storms and the prevailing  low-level wind direction suggest
              that the terrain may play a role  in the cyclogenesis.  Observations also
              suggest that secondary  circulations generated as mature tropical cyclones make
              landfall on  the east coast of Mexico may contribute to cyclogenesis in the 
              region as well.       Previous theoretical studies indicate that the
              interaction of  easterly zonal flows with the terrain may generate easterly
              waves  which serve as the initial circulations that trigger tropical  cyclone
              formation in the eastern Pacific.  The principal  investigator will conduct
              further studies, principally modeling  studies, using a hierarchy of models to
              better diagnose the  evolution of the circulation systems.    ***
