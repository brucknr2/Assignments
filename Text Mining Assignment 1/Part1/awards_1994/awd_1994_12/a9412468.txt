Abstract    :
              9412468  KING      This is a  two year cooperative research project  proposed by
              Dr.  Alexander King,  State University of New York at Stony Brook, and 
              Professor Fu-Rong Chen, National Tsing Hua University.   This  proposal is to
              conduct a study to understand the embrittlement   of copper-bismuth alloys. It
              requests funds to support a half-  time graduate student to work on this
              project and to support the  P.I.'s  travels to Taiwan.  This project enables
              Dr. King to gain  access to equipment that is not yet available in the United 
              States, while he can provide expertise to his collaborator in the  areas of
              specimen preparation and interfacial structure analysis.   The embrittlement of
              metals is an important problem in materials  science and currently poses
              significant limitations in material  applications.  This is an excellent
              project, which addresses an  important problem with promise for useful results
              and provides a  hands-on opportunity for training a U.S. graduate student. 
              This  project is jointly supported by the NSF and the Taiwan National  Science
              Council (NSC),  which provides major support for  laboratory operations.  The
              modest support from the NSF in this  case is extensively leveraged by the NSC.
