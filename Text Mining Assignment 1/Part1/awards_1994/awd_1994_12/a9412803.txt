Abstract    :
              9412803  Holtz  This project involves the recovery of perishable data from the 
              Northridge earthquake of January 1, 1994, as it relates to the  performance of
              Geosynthetic Reinforced Slopes (GRS)  subjected to  seismic loading. 
              Geosynthetic reinforced slopes are earth slopes  (such as road cuttings) which
              are reinforced against slope  failure (landslides) using geosynthetic
              materials.    The project involves: (1) the identification of geosynthetic 
              reinforced slopes which were subjected to substantial shaking by  the
              Northridge earthquake, (2) the estimation of the ground  shaking to which these
              slopes were subjected and any pre-  earthquake movements of the slopes, (3)
              photographing the slopes  from the ground and from the air and the measurement
              of landslide  size, head and side scarps, and reinforcement patterns on the 
              ground, and the collection of soil samples, and (4) the  estimation of slide
              volumes,  distances moved, and slope angles,  and an attempt to correlate soil
              type, slope angle, type of  reinforcement, reinforcement pattern, slope
              orientation and  magnitude of displacement, where applicable.  ***
