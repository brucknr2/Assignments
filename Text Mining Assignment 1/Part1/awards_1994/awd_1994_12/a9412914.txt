Abstract    :
              9412914  Caffarelli  This award supports a continuation of the successful
              Regional Geometry Institutes (RGI).  The  defining feature of the RGI has been
              the integration of researchers, graduate students,  undergraduates, and high
              school teachers in a structured environment that allow all members to  attain
              deeper understanding of the mathematical sciences enterprise as a whole.  The
              project is  designed to increase mutual respect and understanding among the
              groups, while advancing  scholarship and learning.  In a supportive setting
              where education at all levels is the explicit  concern, participants can make
              connections that are difficult or impossible to achieve in their  home
              locations.  The RGI is managed by a small, decentralized group of mathematical
              scientists  and educators.  The Institute for Advanced Study proposes to become
              the institutional leader of  this program, called the Park City/IAS Mathematics
              Institute.  The site for the activity for the  summer of 1995 will be at Park
              City, Utah.
