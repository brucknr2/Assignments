Abstract    :
              9412906  Pincheira  Precast construction using double-Tee members is common in 
              parking garages, commercial and industrial buildings across  the United States
              and has had wide success because of its  proven efficiency an economy.  the
              double-Tee's are used as  walls and diaphragms. Unfortunately the systems were 
              developed primarily for vertical load resistance.  New  areas of the country
              have recently been designated as  seismically active and building codes have
              tightened their  seismic design requirements.  These changes have cast doubt 
              on the use and capacity of precast structural systems, and  lack of thorough
              evidence to the contrary will likely  result in more conservative design
              required by future  codes.  The goal of this project to establish a proven 
              physical basis for connection capacities between thin  concrete flange sections
              such as joint between double-Tee's  used as wall or diaphragm panels to improve
              design methods  for seismic resistance.    To achieve the objective extensive
              cyclic connection  testing will be carried out. The connection test results 
              will be used to develop nonlinear analysis methods and to  suggest code changes
              such as: rational methods of selecting  flange or diaphragm thickness and
              topping thickness if  needed, means of estimating appropriate load reduction 
              factors for precast double-Tee shear walls, steps in  designing ductile  flange
              connections between members, and examples showing non  linear design procedures
              for jointed precast prestressed  diaphragms and walls.    This is a PRESSS
              project.  ***
