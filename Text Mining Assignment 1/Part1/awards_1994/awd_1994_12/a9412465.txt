Abstract    :
              9412465  Hill  Emory University  Dr. Craig A. Hill, Chemistry Department, Emory
              University, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic
              Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division for research into the development
              of heteropolyoxometallates (HPOM) as homogeneous catalysts. The  transfer of
              oxide from an HPOM to alkanes will be  developed because of its central
              importance to any process which involves oxidative functionalization. The
              factors which influence HPOM catalyzed oxidation using the environmentally
              advantageous hydrogen peroxide will be evaluated. As catalysts normally have a
              finite lifetime, new systems will be sought which will heal defects which occur
              in them as they operate. Finally, the ability of HPOM's to induce reactions of
              very unreactive materials such as diamond surfaces and to catalytically oxidize
              hydrogen sulfide will be determined.    Oxidation reactions are very common and
              important in many areas of chemistry. On the industrial scale they are often
              plagued by environmental problems because they either use or produce toxic,
              potentially polluting substances. In this project a new class of
              environmentally benign catalysts will be developed. The basic way  in which
              they function will be assessed and this knowledge will be used to design
              processes for oxidations of very non-reactive materials and for the conversion
              of toxic hydrogen sulfide into sulfur.
