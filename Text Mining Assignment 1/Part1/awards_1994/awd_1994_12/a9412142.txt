Abstract    :
              With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program Professor Bordwell of  
              Northwestern University will measure bond dissociation enthalpies (BDE)   for
              the cleavage of weak acids, HA, by combining the oxidation potentials   of the
              conjugate anions, A-, with the negative logarithm of the acidity   constant of
              the acid in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Fundamental   thermodynamic parameters,
              vital to computational methods and to molecular   modeling studies, will be
              obtained for complex compounds for which   extrapolated values of BDE from
              other data are unreliable.    This project will measure by a method using
              compounds dissolved in   liquids and different from standard methods that
              require gas phase   studies, the energy required to break selected bonds in
              carbon containing   molecules. This contribution is vital to current efforts to
              model by   computer computations  the chemical reactions and physical
              properties of   complex carbon containing compounds.
