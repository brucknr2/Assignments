Abstract    :
              The goal this research is to make sharing of verified hardware  designs more
              practical.  First, a model for describing and  verifying type-based abstract
              modules, which can be used and reused  in different HDL's and proof systems, is
              being developed.  This  model provides a methodological approach to
              verification.   It is  based on work in generic interpreters and
              micro-processor  verification.  Second, a model for interchange and sharing
              library  components is being developed.  This is to enable designers to 
              effectively develop and use module libraries in a distributed  manner.  The
              module libraries being developed are publicly  available so that the ideas
              about reuse can be tested on a large  scale.
