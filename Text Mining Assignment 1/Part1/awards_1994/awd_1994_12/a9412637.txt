Abstract    :
              9412637  Kovacevic       The principal investigator will work with
              representatives of   industry on the development of the prototype of an
              adaptive weld   penetration controller based on vision sensing.  The research
              is a  novel approach for controlling weld bead penetration, specifically  for
              the thin plates is proposed.  The methodology is distinguished  from past
              approaches by the use of (1) an improved method for  sensing the weld pool and
              its surrounding area using an ultra-high  shutter speed camera assisted with
              pulsating laser as an  illumination source; (2) a more effective algorithm for
              image  processing (the extraction of the weld pool boundary is done in  less
              that 100 milliseconds); (3) a model-based relation of the weld  pool geometry,
              joint penetration, and welding process parameters;  and (4) a newly developed
              robust adaptive controller.       The control system will overcome the
              influence of joint   geometry, mismatching, and thickness variation on the weld
              quality   of nickel-based and titanium alloys with thicknesses ranging from  
              one millimeter to two millimeters.
