Abstract    :
                  9412294  Beckham  This Research Initiation Proposal is to support the
              development of  novel polymers based on molecular mobilities of individual 
              components.  The molecular mobilities are specified by the time  scale and
              geometries of motion as determined by 2D exchange NMR  spectroscopy.  A
              polymer, polyrotaxane, will be constructed by  threading a relatively immobile
              linear component with a mobile  cyclic one.  By the judicious choice of
              components based on  molecular mobilities, technologically useful materials
              will emerge.  ***
