Abstract    :
              This award supports acquisition of a rapid sediment analysis system  for
              fine-grained sediments.  The acquisition has an institutional  contribution of
              one half of the system cost.  The instrument being  acquired operates on the
              principle of laser diffraction making  analysis time very short.  The
              instrument will be used to support  research work that relates to
              paleoenvironmental change during the  Pleistocene and Holocene.  Specifically,
              sediments from the  Antarctic continental shelf contain a very high resolution
              record  of changing paleoenvironmental conditions over the last several 
              thousand years.  The instrument will be applied to studies of  sediment records
              related to glacio-marine deposition which are  related to advances and retreats
              of the Antarctic ice sheets.  This  instrument is an asset to a strong
              undergraduate research program  and it will also benefit other undergraduate
              institutions in the  region.
