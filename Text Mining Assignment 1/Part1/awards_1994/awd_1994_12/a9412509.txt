Abstract    :
              9412509  Bosnich  Univ. of Chicago  Dr. Brice Bosnich, Chemistry Department,
              University of Chicago, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and
              Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division for the synthesis of
              chiral, heterobimetallic complexes in which electron transfer from an
              encapsulated metal center to a second metal, in a coordinately unsaturated
              site, initiates a redox reaction involving an exterior substrate. The initial
              stages of the project will concentrate  largely on the synthesis of macrocyclic
              ligands which possess two compartments. One of these is designed to fully
              surround a metal. The second, contiguous site will be more open and designed to
              contain a metal at which reactions may occur. Bimetallic complexes of these
              ligands will be formed with the encapsulating site occupied by a metal which
              can of supply electrons to a second metal contained in the open site. The
              complexes will be developed into two-electron reductants for dioxygen and into
              catalysts for asymmetric olefin epoxidation.    Reactions in which electrons
              are transferred between reactants are of enormous importance in  virtually all
              areas of pure and applied chemistry.  Compounds to be prepared in this study
              will contain two metals. One of these will serve as a reservoir to hold
              electrons which can be transferred to a second metal where they can be utilized
              to perform a chemical reaction. This will permit reactions which require the
              addition of more electrons than the second metal can normally supply. These
              compounds will be used to enhance the versatility of many metal mediated
              processes, including some very important industrial preparations including
              olefin epoxidation.
