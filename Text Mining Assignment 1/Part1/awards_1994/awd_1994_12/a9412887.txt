Abstract    :
              9412887  This proposal attempts to link atomistic and continuum properties  of
              materials.  The PIs focus here mainly on interfaces and  surfaces.  A local
              definition of the elastic properties is  developed which allows a good
              description of localized long  wavelength vibrational modes at grain boundaries
              in single  component metals and alloys, and at bimaterial interfaces.  The PIs 
              plan to extend their work to more complex systems described by  angular
              dependent (covalent) forces.  This work is anticipated to  be of use also for
              studying dislocation motion and crack  propagation.  %%%  This proposal
              concerns an attempt to tie together the large scale  and small scale way of
              describing materials behavior.  It concerns,  in particular, the local
              vibrational properties at internal  surfaces; that is grain boundaries and the
              plane which separates  two dissimilar materials in contact.  The PIs previous
              work  concerned systems whose atoms interact via very simple force laws.  The
              new work should become more useful as it is applied to more  complicated
              systems such as semiconductors and transition metals  (like iron).  This work
              is extremely useful since it tries to meld  together two alternative ways of
              describing the properties of  materials.
