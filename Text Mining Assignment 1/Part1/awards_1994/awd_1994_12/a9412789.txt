Abstract    :
              9412789  Takahashi  The series of Coastal Ocean Space Utilization (COSU) 
              conferences sponsored  by the National Science Foundation  and wide assortment
              of partners has stimulated considerable  interest, cooperation and agreement on
              balanced utilization  and management of our coastal region in harmony with the 
              environment.  The success of these gatherings can be  attributed to the quality
              of the conferees and the  philosophical format.    There is generally a
              dominant core of active decision makers  presenting papers, participating in
              the panel discussions  and interjecting comments throughout the conference.   
              To further expand this network it is proposed that a  symposium on Coastal
              Ocean Space Utilization be held to  focus on marine economic development in
              harmony with the  environment.  The convening of this symposium will 
              accomplish several objectives:       continue to call attention to the need for
              wise    utilization of our coastal regions;       share knowledge of
              environmentally acceptable mechanisms    for enhancing coastal utilization
              while improving or    maintaining standards in these areas;       identify
              future engineering and related environmental    research needs;       discuss
              how ocean applications can serve as the    transition for defense contractors
              and shipyards into a    peacetime economy; and       widely disseminate the
              results of the presentations and    discussions via the publication of
              proceedings containing    the papers presented.    Japan has offered to Co-host
              the meeting and provide funding  for the necessary logistics and on-site
              activities.  Support  has also been provided by NOAA.
