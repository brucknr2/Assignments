Abstract    :
              9412208  Kezunovic  The First International Conference on Digital Simulators for
               Power System Transient Studies (ICDS) is being organized with an  objective of
              providing a forum for exchange of information among  universities, research
              organizations, manufactures, consultants  and utility industry regarding
              research, development,  implementation and application of digital simulators in
              the area  of power system transient studies.  Such a forum does not exist 
              today as a permanent event and very few technical meetings in the  past were
              devoted to this subject.  The proposed conference will  establish a permanent
              forum which may be held every two years and  will provide an opportunity for
              discussing state-of-the-art  issues in this important area of power system
              studies.  ***
