Abstract    :
                   Atmospheric chemistry is a rather young discipline, but  technically very
              demanding.  The international programs that rely  on well-trained cadre of
              atmospheric chemists for executing complex  and ambitious research, monitoring
              and assessment tasks include the  International Global Atmospheric Chemistry
              Program (IGAC--a core  project of the IGBP), the Global Climate Observing
              System) and the  System for Analysis, Research and Training (START--a core
              project  of the IGBP).  To promote education and training in this field, 
              scientists in IGAC, GAW and START have joined forces to design and  execute an
              integrated approach to "academic capacity building" in  developing countries. 
              The American Geophysical Union (AGU) and its  affiliates will establish an
              international pool of voluntary  lecturers recruited from their memberships and
              to coordinate the  initial efforts of the program.  These include:        
              Establishment of an international voluntary teaching faculty.      
              Establishment of a steering committee in charge of curriculum       design for
              an atmospheric chemistry program which can be       implemented at
              participating universities in developing       countries.       Execution of a
              series of mini-sessions and workshops involving       members of the voluntary
              teaching faculty for finalizing the       implementation plan.    Preparation
              of a proposal which can be submitted to international  funding agencies for
              implementing the academic capacity building  program.
