Abstract    :
              This RUI grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the continuing  work
              of Professor Cheryl Stevenson at Illinois State University to study  anions and
              anion radicals of annulene and homoannulenes. These NMR and  EPR spectroscopic
              studies will make use of deuterium isotopic perturbation  techniques. The four
              focal point of research are the determination of equilibria  between
              ring-opened and ring-closed  16 annulene structures, the  characterization of
              the electron distribution in sigma-bonded  16 - 8 - and   16 - 6 -bisannulenes,
              the analysis of the deuterium effect on the splitting of  the degeneracy of
              non-bonding orbitals of  8 - and  16 -annulenes, and the  isotope effect of the
              solution electron affinity of pyrene.     In this project Dr. Stevenson will
              conduct spectroscopic studies on dianions  and anion radicals of differently
              sized annulenes. Her undergraduate research  employs the deuterium isotopic
              perturbation technique to investigate their  bonding properties and electronic
              distributions. The fundamental studies on  the isotope effect on orbital
              splitting and solution electron affinities will be  supported by collaborative
              theoretical studies.
