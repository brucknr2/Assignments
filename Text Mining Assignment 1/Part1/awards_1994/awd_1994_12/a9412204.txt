Abstract    :
              9412204  Silfvast  We believe that not only will this conference serve to focus
              the attention of the industrial and academic communities on new applications of
              UV and VUV lasers, but that it may perform a service to the funding agencies as
              well.  It is expected that, as a result of this meeting, a clearer picture of
              "where we need to go to enhance technology" will emerge.  A brief proceedings
              of this meeting will be published.    In addition, we believe that this
              conference will aid the commercialization of these sources and their
              applications at time when new products are badly needed by US industry.  The
              support provided by NSF will be used specifically to enable university faculty
              and students to attend this conference.  This will encourage more work in a
              field expected to become vital in electronics, optics and medicine.  ***
