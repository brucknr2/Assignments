Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the  
              Chemistry Division, Warren will use ultrafast laser pulse-shaping   techniques
              to produce molecules in selected quantum states.  A new pulse   shaping
              approach will produce easily adjustable waveforms with   femtosecond structural
              features.  A very rapid method of pulse shape   detection will also be
              developed.  These techniques will be applied to   molecular systems to try to
              alter relaxation rates, selectively excite   molecules in the presence of
              competing absorbers, or force molecules up   anharmonic ladders. 
              Experimentally measured molecular responses will be   used to make the target
              molecule itself optimize the design of the   manipulation pulse.  %%%  In these
              experiments Warren will be studying how to excite molecules   which are about
              to react so that the reactions will go along one desired   pathway rather than
              along one or  several undesired pathways.  This type   of ability to control
              the outcome of chemical reactions will have an   effect on many chemical
              manufacturing processes, making some possible   which previously were not, or
              making others more efficient and   cost-effective.
