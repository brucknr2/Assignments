Abstract    :
              Laser eye surgery is the most effective known procedure for  treating choroidal
              neovascularization (CNV) found in a variety of  conditions including
              age-related macular degeneration, histoplasmic  choroiditis, etc.  However, the
              current rate of success of this  procedure is less than 50% for eradication of
              the CNV following one  treatment session, with a recurrence and/or persistence
              rate of  about 50%.  This research will make possible an instrument that  will
              drastically reduce this failure rate.    The instrument consists of a
              computerized multi-spectral 3-D fundus  camera with an associated head-up
              display and a real-time laser  tracking system.  The tracking system uses a set
              of automatic image  analysis routines that allow accurate mapping of the
              pathologies,  and computerized laser treatment planning.    The core
              image-processing problems that are being addressed are:  (i) constructing a
              wide-area map of the retinal vasculature from an  image sequence; and (ii)
              determining the location of the current  frame relative to the wide-area map
              constructed in step (i) to an  accuracy of 2 pixels, or better, at a frame rate
              of at least 30 per  second.  The above problems are being solved by the
              development of  a fast algorithm for matching point sets with unknown 
              correspondences, in the presence of a small number of noise points.   This
              algorithm operates by limiting the search to a minimally-  sufficient subset of
              the most reliable image feature points.  In  addition, the proposed algorithm
              is being implemented on a linear  array of processors, further enabling
              real-time operation.
