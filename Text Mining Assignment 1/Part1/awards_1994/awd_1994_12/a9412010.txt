Abstract    :
              9412010  Nerem  This project is on research to develop a tissue culture model
              for  blood vessels.  The model involves the culture of smooth muscle  cells
              within a collagen gel to produce a support for a monolayer  of endothelial
              cells.  There are three specific aims: (1) to  continue the evaluation of a
              reconstituted blood vessel system  under steady state and pulsatile flow; (2)
              to optimize the  collagen/smooth muscle cell matrix within the model blood
              vessel;  and (3) to extend these cell culture models to a tubular 
              configuration.  ***
