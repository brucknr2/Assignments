Abstract    :
                        9412997  Schuster, W.  The Black Rock Forest Consortium, a group of
              fourteen New  York-area academic institutions, will install environmental 
              monitoring facility at its field station, the 1500 hectare  Black Rock Forest. 
              The Black Rock Forest is located in the  Hudson Highlands, 80 km north of New
              York City, and  possesses a wide variety of terrestrial and aquatic habitats 
              for study.  It has carefully protected and managed for  nearly a century, and
              has been utilized by the Black Rock  Forest Consortium since 1989.  The forest
              has become a focal  point for scientific field studies and education for 
              thousands of faculty and students from Consortium  institutions.    Despite
              many natural features that make it a logical  location for scientific field
              work, the Black Rock Forest  lacks a meteorological facility.  An increasing
              trend in use  of the station for biological and environmental science  studies
              that created a need for such a facility.  The  facility will continuously
              record a range of important  meteorological variables at two locations within
              the Forest,  and will include precipitation sampling equipment.  Data  will be
              downloaded, and entered into a widely-available  database, and equipment will
              be maintained on a regular,  weekly basis by Black Rock Forest staff.  The
              facility will  be one component of a regional network of monitoring  stations
              spanning 330 km along the Hudson River.  The  resulting data will significantly
              improve the quality of  ongoing studies in plant ecology, aquatic ecology, 
              dendrochronology, and biogeochemistry, and will stimulate  the expansion of
              scientific and educational use of the Black  Rock Forest.
