Abstract    :
              9412817  Parker  This is an award to provide renewed support for the operation
              of  the National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of  Engineering,
              National Research Council's Water Science Technology  Board.  This Board
              provides a focal point for studies related to  environmental engineering and
              hydrology.  The Board's objective  is to improve the scientific and
              technological basis for  resolving important questions and issues relating to 
              management  of water resources.  This award is jointly supported by the 
              Environmental Engineering segment of the Environmental  Remediation Program in
              the Engineering Directorate and by the  Hydrologic Sciences Program in the
              Directorate for Geosciences.    An important function of the Water Science
              Technology Board is to  conduct studies and to sponsor workshops and
              conferences that can  be utilized for program planning purposes.  The Board
              also  functions as an appropriate means for coordination of research  plans
              with other Federal agencies including FEMA, USGS, EPA, DOE,  and the U.S. Army
              Corps of Engineers.  ***
