Abstract    :
                This award, in the Small Grants for Exploratory Research mode,  provides seed
              funding for initial exploration of a national virtual  laboratory (NVL) in
              robotics research.  The Laboratory will take  advantage of the emerging
              National Information Infrastructure by  connecting research facilities across
              the country to design joint  experiments in robotics.  These will be
              geographically distributed  experiments, using different agents at separate
              sites, such that  perception/action modules will interact physically with their
              local  environments, but will communicate over the network to coordinate  their
              accomplishment of a common task.  Initially the NVL will  develop an
              infrastructure for sharing resources among  geographically distributed
              university and industry research  laboratories.  This infrastructure will
              consist of communication  capabilities for video, voice and data links offering
              high-quality  real-time excange and remote operation capabilities.  This will 
              enable the researchers to share and test all their software and  hardware
              resources under diverse environmental conditions.
