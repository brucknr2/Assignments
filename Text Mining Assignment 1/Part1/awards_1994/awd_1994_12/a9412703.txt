Abstract    :
                      9412703  Justice    Much of our understanding of how the brain controls
              behavior  depends upon our ability to accurately describe how cells  within the
              brain communicate with one another.  Some general  information on this process
              has been obtained by removing  brain tissue and analyzing it chemically, but
              this provides  no information on  the dynamics of chemical signalling that 
              actually takes place during episodes of behavior.   With  this grant, Dr.
              Justice will refine techniques for measuring  the flux of chemical
              neurotransmitters within the brain  during bouts of natural behavior.  Dr.
              Justice's group will  concentrate upon the dynamics of the neurotransmitter 
              dopamine.    This work will make it possible to describe the chemical  dynamics
              of the dopamine system (and also, to some extent,  serotonin and acetylcholine)
              in a precise way that is  directly correlated with organismic behavior.  It
              should  greatly stimulate our understanding of normal brain  function, the
              action of several classes of drugs on the  brain, and the processes associated
              with abnormal function  of neurotransmitter systems.  ***
