Abstract    :
                9412822  Hu    An International Conference on InP and related materials is 
              being  held to address current topics in materials growth and  characterization
              including several contemporary topics on  epitaxy  of increasing importance,
              namely: Epitaxy, Chemical  Processes;  Selective Epitaxy and Regrowth;
              Epitaxial Processes for  Patterned  Growth, Epitaxial Structures and Epitaxy
              for Device  Applications.  There are also a number of sessions dealing with
              devices,  OEICs(optoelectronic integrated circuits) and device physics  of 
              advanced electronic and photonic devices based on InP with a  strong emphasis
              on fundamental processes.  Additionally  there  will be an opportunity to
              assess the field, and to establish  ties  between universities, research
              institutions, and industry.  It is  expected that top scientists in the field
              will attend, and  that  the Conference will provide an effective forum to
              discuss  and  delineate the critical scientific issues in this research  area, 
              and to consider and define the approaches and techniques  needed  to address
              them.  %%%   An evaluation of the progress and status of InP and related 
              materials, and especially the critical materials research  issues  in epitaxy,
              processing, and the relationship of materials  research to  device and circuit
              fabrication along with  current  assessments of the most important contemporary
              research  issues in  this field will be of great value to the understanding and
               enhanced utilization of advanced materials in the field of  electronics and
              photonics.  ***
