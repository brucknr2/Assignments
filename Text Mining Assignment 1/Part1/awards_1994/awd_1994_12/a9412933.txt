Abstract    :
              9412933  Busch-Vishniac  The proposal addresses (1) analytical models and (2)
              the development of a laboratory prototype for the evaluation of Tape Automated
              Bonding (TAB) bonds in a non-deductive manner.  The parameters considered are
              bonding pressure, temperature and testing duration which are important to the
              semiconductor electronics industry.  The proposal  describes research to relate
              these macroscopic parameters to the predicted and measurable quality of the
              bond, particularly the mechanical strength of the bond and, perhaps, eventually
              the reliability.  ***
