Abstract    :
              Eugenics is a pseudo-science that attempts to link human behavioral 
              characteristics primarily to inheritance.  Eugenics led to  sterilization
              measures and anti-immigration laws in the United  States and to Nazi racial
              laws in Germany.  Eugenics, however, was  an international phenomenon.  Ms.
              Sumiko Otsubo, under the  direction of Dr. James Bartholomew, is investigating
              how eugenics  developed in Japan.    Eugenics in Japan had a substantial impact
              on Japanese society in  the first half of the twentieth century.  In her
              dissertation, Ms.  Otsubo is comparing the Japanese eugenics to other
              countries'  experiences in terms of the patterns of diffusion, promotion, 
              perception, and the eventual discrediting of eugenics.
