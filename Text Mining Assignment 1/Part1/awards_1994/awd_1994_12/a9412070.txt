Abstract    :
              9412070  Richards      This equipment will be used in studies of turbulent
              mixing phenomena (single and two phase) in nonreacting and reacting shear
              flows.  Two major projects will extensively employ this equipment.  These are: 
              (1) droplet dispersions by large scale structures in reacting and nonreacting
              jets; and (2) dynamics of a scalar field in a swirling jet.  Besides these two
              projects, it is anticipated that the equipment will provide broad support to
              faculty doing experimental fluid mechanics research.  ***
