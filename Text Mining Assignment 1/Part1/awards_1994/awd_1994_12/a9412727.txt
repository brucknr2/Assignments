Abstract    :
              Lyberg, Lars  SBR-9412727      This award provides partial support for an
              International Conference on Survey Measurement and Process Quality, scheduled
              for April 1995, in Bristol, United Kingdom.  The conference is the fifth in a
              series of conferences on survey methods organized by the Survey Research
              Methods (SRM) Section of the American Statistical Association (ASA).  A major
              objective of the conference is to promote a shift of research interest from
              post-survey quality evaluation and correction to quality control of ongoing
              survey processes, like questionnaire development, interviewing, data capture,
              editing and coding.  Another important objective is to encourage international
              interdisciplinary and cross cultural research and exploit the great interest in
              these issues now emerging outside North America.  An edited monograph of select
              conference papers is planned.  The monograph will widely disseminate research
              results on survey measurement and process quality to the international survey
              community.
