Abstract    :
              9412279  Maxwell         The American Mathematical Society requests a grant in
              the amount  of $25,520 for Wiener Centennial Symposium, to be held in October, 
              1994.       Members of the Organizing Committee for the Wiener conference  are:
                    David Benney (ex-officio; Head, Dept of Math., MIT)       Roger Brockett
              (Division of Applied Sciences, Harvard)       Donald Burkholder (U of Illinois)
                    David Jerison, Chair (MIT)       Henry P. McKean (Courant Institute, NYU)
                    Daniel Stroock (MIT)       Isadore M. Singer (MIT)       Elias M. Stein
              (Princeton)       Rather than organize a commemorative workshop reviewing
              Wiener's  work, the organizing committee intends to use the occasion of the 
              centennial of his birth to alert young researchers to the many  researchers to
              the many opportunities in analysis and its  applications in the spirit of
              Norbert Wiener.   The Organizers plan a  weeklong  conference in October 1994. 
              The Conference will take place  at M.I.T., and the mathematical portion will be
              co-sponsored by the  American Mathematical Society and MIT.
