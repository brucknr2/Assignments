Abstract    :
              9412636  Bass       It has been projected that mass-produced electric vehicles 
              will penetrate the U.S. market in substantial numbers by the end  of this
              decade.  Much of the required infrastructure needed to  support this new
              technology remains to be developed.       The proposed collaboration is jointly
              sponsored by Georgia  Power Company and Electricite de France.  Both of these
              utilities  have established major research programs in EV infrastructure 
              development.  The 6 month internship will occur at the EDF  Research Facility
              in Paris, where Dr. Bass will be exposed to a  broad spectrum of research
              activities.  More specifically, he  will focus on charging and power quality
              issues.  ***
