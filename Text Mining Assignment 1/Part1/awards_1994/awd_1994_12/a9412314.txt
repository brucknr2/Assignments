Abstract    :
              9412314  Saka  An Exploratory investigation will be made of the tribological 
              behavior of shape memory alloys under an SGER award.  Both dry  and lubricated
              sliding test will be conducted on NiTi shape  memory alloys with various
              martensite transformation  temperatures.  The effects of pseudoelasticity and
              thermally  triggered shape memory on friction, wear, and wear mechanisms  will
              be determined.  ***
