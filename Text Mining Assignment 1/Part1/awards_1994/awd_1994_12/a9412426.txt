Abstract    :
              9412426  Koch    The goal of this study is to understand how the electrical 
              signals (called spikes) generated by nerve cells encode  information.  Studying
              nerve cells that are part of the  early visual or auditory pathways in the
              nervous system  provides an opportunity to directly relate visual or  auditory
              stimuli with the trains of spikes generated by  these neurons.  To understand
              how the nervous system works  it is important to understand how time-varying
              signals such  as the velocity of a moving target in the visual field of an 
              animal is encoded in such spike trains.  Another important  issue is to
              understand how information encoded in neuronal  spike trains depends on the
              biophysical properties of the  nerve cells, the hardware of the nervous system.
               This group  of investigators will apply methods of information theory,  which
              up to now have been mainly used in the engineering  sciences, to estimate the
              rate, in bits per second, at which  nerve cells can transmit information and to
              understand  better the nature of the encoding of time-varying signals in 
              neuronal spike trains.  The role of the biophysics of single  cells in this
              information transmission will be investigated  by performing realistic computer
              simulations of nerve cell  activity.
