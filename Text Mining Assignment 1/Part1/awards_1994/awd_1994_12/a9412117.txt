Abstract    :
              9412117  Howe   The purpose of this research is to experimentally test
              hypotheses derived from a census and five-year recensus of >7500 mapped woody
              perennials of 26 species in Joshua Tree National Monument. Most of these
              species show strong intraspecific and interspecific aggregation, and herbivory
              of unknown effect. Experimental results will be interpreted in light of a
              10-year re-census, scheduled for March 1994.    Using exclosures around members
              of the dominant woody perennial and in open areas nearby, we propose to
              distinguish effects of intra- and interspecific competition, granivory,
              herbivory, desiccation, and facilitation in establishment, growth, and/or
              mortality of new seedlings over two years, and in growth and mortality of
              seedlings, and juveniles already present. Using protected and unprotected
              transplants of seedlings, we expect to test effects of competition and
              facilitation of controlled samples of a long-lived perennial that is not
              browsed by vertebrate herbivores, a short-lived perennial that is heavily
              browsed by jackrabbits, against a standard seedlings of the dominant shrub,
              which suffer moderate to heavy vertebrate herbivory. Exclosures and transplants
              will distinguish processes that account for extensive bare ground and
              aggregated spatial dispersions of key woody perennials common at this site.  
              %%%  This dissertation research provides a nice integrate map data from
              permanent plots with field experiments to assess some of the important
              determinants of spatial pattern and plant associations in a desert community.
