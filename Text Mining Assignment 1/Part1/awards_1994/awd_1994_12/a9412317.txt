Abstract    :
              This project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry  Program,
              focusses on the development and experimental calibration  of a time-of-flight
              (TOF) mass spectrometer for the simultaneous  determination of the size and
              chemical composition of aerosols.   During the tenure of this three year
              continuing grant, Professor  Prather and her students at the University of
              California at  Riverside will draw upon their expertise in laser spectroscopy
              to  develop a unique instrumental capability with which fundamental  chemical
              issues underlying atmospheric environmental chemistry can  be addressed.  The
              combination of multiple lasers with TOF mass  spectrometry enables the
              intricate timing and high sensitivity  necessary for the simultaneous size and
              composition analysis of  aerosols.    This instrument development project will
              provide environmental  scientists with the ability to simultaneously determine
              the size  and chemical composition of aerosol particles which are major 
              determinants of atmospheric quality.  It is expected that this  instrumental
              design will be rapidly incorporated into commercial  instruments.
