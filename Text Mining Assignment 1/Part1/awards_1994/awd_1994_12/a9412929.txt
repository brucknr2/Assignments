Abstract    :
              9412929  This work is a collaborative effort between an experimental group 
              under the direction of Professor Jacob Schaefer and a theoretical  group under
              the direction of Professor Robert Yaris.  The  experimental group has developed
              new methods using solid-state  nuclear magnetic resonance to accurately measure
              interchain  distances between labeled atoms in polycarbonate.  In this grant 
              period we will measure additional interchain distances to further  characterize
              the structure of the glassy state of polycarbonate.   In addition, we will
              study blends of polycarbonate with a  derivitized polycarbonate to study the
              changes in dynamic behavior.   This work will also be combined with dynamic
              mechanical studies on  the mechanical properties of polycarbonate and the
              blends.  The  theoretical group has developed a general method to simulate the 
              long-term dynamics of a system and has applied this to a simplified  model of
              polycarbonate.  In this grant period we shall extend this  simulation, in
              several steps, to polycarbonate itself using  constraints and parameters
              obtained from the experimental group.  %%%  Glassy polymers (plastics) are very
              important industrial materials.   In particular, polycarbonate has very unusual
              physical properties  -- it is bulletprooof glass.  We are studying it in order
              to  characterize and understand its molecular dynamic properties.  The  
              long-range goal of the study and modeling is to develop an  understanding of
              the connection between the microscopic dynamics of  polymer glasses and their
              macroscopic physical properties.
