Abstract    :
              The PI proposes a three-year effort for a theoretical investigation  of the
              nonlinear electrodynamic coupling to the mesosphere and the  lower ionosphere
              of intense short duration electromagnetic pulses  originating in lightning
              discharges.  He will develop a three-  dimensional model describing the changes
              in the electron density,  chemistry, and optical emissions in the D region
              stimulated by  electromagnetic energy released in tropospheric lightning 
              discharges.  Expected results include (1) determination of the 3-D 
              configurations of the disturbed ionospheric regions within which  significant
              changes occur in temperature, airglow, electron  density, and chemical
              processes; (2) determination of the fraction  of electromagnetic energy from
              lightning deposited in the lower  ionosphere and the dominant sinks of such
              energy; (3) determination  of the dependence of the resulting disturbances on
              the type of  lightning discharges; (4) development of the theoretiaal framework
               upon which spectroscopic measurements of the airglow enhancements  can be
              based to remotely diagnose the ambient electron density  profiles; and (5)
              assessment of the effects of the lightning  electromagnetic pulses on the
              thermal and chemical balance of the  upper atmosphere on a global scale.
