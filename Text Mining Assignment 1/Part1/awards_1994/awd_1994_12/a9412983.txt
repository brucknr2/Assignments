Abstract    :
              9412983  Feld  This project involves the dissertation research of a student  in
              cultural anthropology from the University of Texas.   The  student will study
              how Native Americans on the Apache San  Carlos reservation in Arizona  adapt
              and refashion American  popular culture in constructing their Indigenous
              identities.  Focusing on contemporary popular music, the student will  conduct
              participant observation  among a range of musical  practitioners.  The central
              focii of the project will be the  formal properties of  various musical
              expressions, the  social positions of the participants, the way the music 
              deals with contemporary power relations of Indians and the  dominant culture,
              how historical, biographical and emotional  issues are encoded in the songs.  
              The student will play  music with local musicians, and will transcribe and
              analyze  musical and linguistic texts, and interview musicians and  listeners
              about life historical experiences with popular  music.    This research is
              important because popular music is a major  part of the self-identification of
              young people.  By  studying the role of music in minority life, how people 
              adapt dominant culture to express their subordinate  existence, the project
              will add important understanding of  minority cultures in the stressful
              condition of culture  contact in contemporary life.  This knowledge will be 
              valuable to a wide range of social actors and institutions,  from schools, who
              need to know how to motivate students  towards academic interests, to work
              places, who need to  understand what young people are interested in to deal
              with  them successfully.
