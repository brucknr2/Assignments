Abstract    :
              9412011  Rutledge  This Equipment Grant funds the purchase of computer 
              equipment, audio interface components and support software  which is dedicated
              to support research in engineering.  The  equipment will be used for several
              projects, including  speech processing to compensate for sensorineural hearing 
              losses, speech recognition over the telephone, enhancement  of alaryngeal
              speech, and audio processing based on  psychoacoustics.  Acquisition of this
              equipment will permit  processing of higher quality speech and audio signals,
              and  implementation of algorithms having much greater complexity  with more
              efficiency.  ***
