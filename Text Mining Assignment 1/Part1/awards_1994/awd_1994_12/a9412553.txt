Abstract    :
                This three-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative research in logic
              programming between Dale A. Miller of the University of Pennsylvania and Pierre
              Deransart of the French National Institute for Research in Computer Science and
              Applied Mathematics (INRIA), Rocquencourt, France.  The objective of their
              research is to update and improve Prolog, a programming language designed from
              logic programming principles.  Although Prolog offers many novel programming
              possibilities, it does not incorporate software principles of modules, types,
              higher-order programming, and data abstraction.  The investigators will use two
              approaches to address these deficiencies:  intuitionistic theory of logic
              programming and modularity in logic programming.  The U.S. investigator and
              colleagues bring to this collaboration considerable expertise in the
              development of logic programming languages that encompass modular programming.
              This is complemented by the research at INRIA-Rocquencourt on modular
              programming in logic programming and application and theory of the
              intuitionistic theory of clauses.  The project will advance development of a
              module system for logic programming and enhance understanding of language
              design with modular constraints.
