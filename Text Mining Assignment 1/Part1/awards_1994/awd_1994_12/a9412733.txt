Abstract    :
              9412733  Tsao       The objective of this research is to investigate the dynamic
               modeling and real-time control of machining processes, in  particular
              drilling.  This project will use mixed time domain and  drill angle domain
              modeling for the drilling process, statistical  time series canonical variate
              analysis techniques for identifying  the multi-input and multi-output
              time-varying nonlinear process  parameters, and robust adaptive feedback and
              feedforward algorithms  for form tool drilling and high-speed drilling process
              control.  In  addition, this project will investigate the use of spindle and
              feed  drive power or current in lieu of the drilling torque and thrust  force
              as feedback measurements for cost effective factory  implementation.       The
              successful implementation of the project has the potential  to significantly
              improve drilling quality and extend operating  regimes.  It could also provide
              a methodology for dynamic modeling  and process control of other machining
              processes.
