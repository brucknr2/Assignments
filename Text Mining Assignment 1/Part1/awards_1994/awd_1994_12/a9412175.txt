Abstract    :
              9412175  Manley       A program of electromagnetic nuclear physics will be
              carried  out at the MIT/Bates, SLAC, and CEBAF laboratories.  Principal  focus
              will be on measurement of the neutron charge form factor.  A measurement of the
              spin structure of the neutron and proton  will be carried out at SLAC.  In
              addition, a program of studying  nucleon resonances will be initiated at the
              CEBAF lab.  All these  measurements will provide important constraints on the
              quark sub-  structure of nucleons.  Lastly, a series of nuclear structure 
              measurements at other labs will be brought to completion.  ***
