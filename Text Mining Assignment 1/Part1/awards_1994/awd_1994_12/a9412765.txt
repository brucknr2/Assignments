Abstract    :
              9412765  Ballance    This grant supports the "Better Ceramics through Chemistry"
               Conference to be held at San Francisco, CA, April 4-8, 1994.  This conference
              brings together materials scientists, chemists  and ceramists to address a wide
              range of chemical approached to  the synthesis of ceramics or ceramics
              precursors and their  associated processing to form films, fibers, powders etc.
              with  precisely controlled compositions & microstructures.  The  technical
              program will cover over 250 papers in these areas.  The  requested funds are
              $5000 to support graduate student  participation.  %%%  "Better Ceramics
              through Chemistry" is a vital issue for high  quality, reliable and
              reproducible ceramics & ceramics based  electrical and  structural components. 
              The conference provides  an opportunity to graduate students to get
              familiarized with this  important area of materials science of the future high
              tech.  ceramics.  ***
