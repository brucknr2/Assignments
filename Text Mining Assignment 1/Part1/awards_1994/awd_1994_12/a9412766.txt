Abstract    :
              This grant will provide partial support for 20 graduate  students and postdocs
              to attend the Conference on Physics  from Large Gamma Ray Detector Arrays,
              August 2-6, 1994, in  Berkeley, CA.  This conference will concentrate on the 
              latest advances in Nuclear Spectroscopy to come from gamma  ray experiments
              utilizing large detector arrays including  the new GAMMA SPHERE detector just
              coming on line at  Berkeley and a similar effort in Europe, EUROGAM.  ***
