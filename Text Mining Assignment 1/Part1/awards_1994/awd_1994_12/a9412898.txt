Abstract    :
                  Research Planning Grant:  Experimenting with Different Control  Structures
              for Text Analysis    This grant provides support for planning a research
              project based  on the previous natural language processing research of the 
              principal investigator, which was interrupted for a period of time.   Its
              emphasis is on study and experimentation in two areas related  to text
              analysis.  The first area involves verb classification  taxonomies, and will
              incorporate recent linguistic work in the  categorization of English verbs,
              along with implementations in  existing computational systems.  The second area
              is that   of flexible control structures for integration of semantic, 
              syntactic, and pragmatic information in processing, with the hope  of making
              the control of the analysis process flexible while  retaining the efficiency of
              some of the best syntactic parsing  procedures.
