Abstract    :
              9412196  Wang       The award is for the development of a process and machinery 
               for net-shape production of parts made from semi-solid materials.    The
              materials could be metal alloys or metal-matrix composites.    Semi-solid
              processing enables use of lower die temperatures, higher   viscosity, lower
              part porosity, lower thermal shrinkage, and better   grain structure.  A screw
              injection molding machine has been   modified for die casting of semi-solid
              material.  The feasibility   of changing properties of the castings such as
              solid fraction,   particle size, etc. by manipulating process control variables
              will  be investigated.  Net shape die casting experiments to produce  simple
              three-dimensional parts will be conducted.       If the research is successful,
              the process may have a great   impact on the die-casting industry and could
              make the traditional   die-casting process obsolete.
