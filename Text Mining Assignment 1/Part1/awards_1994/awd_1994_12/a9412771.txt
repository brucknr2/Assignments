Abstract    :
              9412771  Johnston       Research will be carried out at LAMPF into the flavor 
              changing probability for neutrinos produced in various pion decay  modes.  An
              active detector based on 200 tons of liquid  scintillator will be used to
              detect reaction products following  inverse beta-decay on protons in the
              scintillator.  Limits set on  the cross section for this and related processes
              will set new  limits, improved by at least an order of magnitude over existing 
              limits, on the neutrino mass differences between different flavor  neutrinos. 
              Research in electroproduction of hypernuclei will be  carried out at CEBAF,
              focusing on the lambda(hyperon)-nucleon  effective interaction.  A specialized
              spectrometer will be  developed for tagging the virtual photon which initiates
              the  reaction.  ***
