Abstract    :
              9412485  Fackler  This award supports the participation of twenty U.S.
              scientists  and science educators in the first Gordon Conference on Science 
              Education to be held in Europe.  The subject is the impact of  new technologies
              on science education, with particular  reference to the visualization of
              concepts and molecular  structures.  The meeting is co-organized by Professors
              John  Fackler of Texas A & M University and W. Gerhard Pohl of Linz,  Austria. 
              It will take place in late September, 1994, at the  Swabian Conference Center
              in Irsee, Germany, with European  participants significantly outnumbering
              American participants.   The conference program was organized along the very
              successful  Gordon Research Conference procedures.  This includes bringing 
              together research scientists and educators for critical  examination of various
              initiatives in science education, in an  atmosphere that is conducive to
              generating joint ventures  between research scientists and educators.   
              Sharing of ideas world wide is as important in science  education as it is in
              scientific research.  The U.S. has no  monopoly on effective methodologies. 
              The European site of the  meeting was chosen with the specific objective of
              introducing  U.S. participants to the variety of novel approaches being  taken
              by European science educators.  The U.S. participants are  expected to gain
              many new contacts and ideas for strengthening  programs in science education in
              the U.S.  ***
