Abstract    :
              9412984  Wahl  Kirtland Community College requests support from NSF for 
              connection of its campus network to MICHnet.  MICHnet is the  midlevel network
              located in the state of Michigan and it will  provide operations management and
              information services and will  give Kirtland Community College a connection to
              the NSFNET, a  high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone 
              network.    The College needs greater functionality and network speed to be 
              able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers  along with
              being able to implement a more reliable mail system.  Students and faculty
              research will benefit from the link.  This  is also a unique opportunity for
              the school to explore innovative  educational resources.
