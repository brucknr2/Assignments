Abstract    :
                  9412644  Yong  This research will support an Engineering Faculty Internship
              under  the GOALI program at the Corporate Research Laboratories of  Motorola,
              Inc.  The primary objective of the research is to advance  the state of the art
              knowledge in designing and fabricating  piezoelectric thin film resonators. 
              The project will complement an  on-going experimental research program on thin
              film devices at the  Phoenix Corporate Research Laboratories of Motorola, Inc. 
              The  principal investigator at Motorola, Inc. is Mr. Luke Mang.  The  proposed
              work will be performed in two phases: (I) research and  development of finite
              element programs for piezoelectric thin film  resonators, and (II) parametric
              study of thin film resonators using  the results of experimental research at
              Motorola, Inc. and the  numerical models developed in phase I.  The impact of
              the proposed  work is a better analysis/design tool for piezoelectric thin film
               resonators.  ***
