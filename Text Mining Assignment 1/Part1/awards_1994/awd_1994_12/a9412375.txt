Abstract    :
              9412375  Bock      The PI will organize and run a topical workshop on
              "Continuous GPS Networks and Seismic Networks" for a group of about 40
              participants, including approximately a number of graduate students and
              postdocs.  The workshop will be jointly funded by Scripps Oceanographic
              Institute, UNAVCO, and IRIS and will focus on how UNAVCO can best support PIs
              with global and regional products and how IRIS might participate in the support
              of global observations.   Global data collection and analysis issues to be
              discussed at the workshop are directly related to the HPCC initiative.  ****
