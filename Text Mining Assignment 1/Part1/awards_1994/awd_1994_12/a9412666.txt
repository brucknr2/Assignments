Abstract    :
              9412666  Rix  The January 17, 1994 Northridge Earthquake (M=6.6) caused 
              liquefaction-induced ground failures in the San Fernando  valley, Simi valley,
              and Redondo Beach areas.  Of particular  interest were the liquefaction
              features (sand boils and  ground fissures) observed in the abandoned reservoir 
              ("debris basin") upstream of the Lower San Fernando Dam.  Free-field
              accelerations as large as 0.90 g (horizontal) and  0.60 g (vertical) were
              observed at California Strong Motion  Instrumentation Program (CSMIP) stations
              in the vicinity of  the dam.    Although sand boils and fissures offer valuable
              surface  evidence of liquefaction, they reveal little about the  subsurface
              nature of the liquefaction.  This project uses  ground penetrating radar (GPR)
              tests to image the observed  liquefaction features nondestructively.  GPR uses 
              electromagnetic waves to image the subsurface, resulting in  a representation
              of the site stratigraphy that is similar to  a seismic reflection cross
              section.  The objective is to  perform GPR tests along several lines to image
              the surface  along which lateral spreads developed, and along several  closely
              spaced lines to generate a three-dimensional image  of a sand boil.  It is
              anticipated that detailed subsurface  images of these liquefaction features
              will be useful in  planning subsequent site investigations.    The project uses
              a global positioning system (GPS) receiver  to measure the topography of the
              area of the ground  penetrating radar measurements.  These GPS measurements 
              allow the radar data to be corrected for topographic  effects.  ***
