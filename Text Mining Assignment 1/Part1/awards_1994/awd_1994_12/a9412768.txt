Abstract    :
              With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program Professors Saunders and   Cross
              from Yale University will study the mechanism of the  insertion and   release
              process that creates endohedral nobel gas compounds of   Buckminsterfullerene.
              Equilibrium constants and thermodynamic parameters   will be theoretically and
              experimentally determined for the binding of   atoms and small molecules  in
              the interior of fullerenes. The   photochemical release of helium from
              endohedral binding in fullerenes   will be explored.    This research will
              study the unique behavior of a new form of carbon   called Buckminsterfullerene
              in which carbon atoms are bonded together to   form a closed surface like a
              soccer ball. Helium atoms are incorporated   inside the closed surface under
              conditions of very high pressures of   helium. The behavior of this unique form
              of material will be explored.   These compounds may find new applications in
              the fields of  medicine,   pharmaceuticals, and  materials.
