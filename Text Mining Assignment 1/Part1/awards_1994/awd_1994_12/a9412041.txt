Abstract    :
              This grant will provide funds for the purchase of a modern FT-IR spectrometer
              system for the Chemical Engineering Department at North Carolina State
              University.  The equipment will support a variety of projects in polymer
              science and engineering including characterization of gas-polymer interaction
              in novel, highly selective polymeric membrane materials and the effect of
              copolymer sequencing distribution on barrier properties of thermotropic liquid
              crystalline polymers.    The research projects associated with this equipment
              award should help to improve the application of polymers in the industrial and
              commercial separation of gases and for other purposes.
