Abstract    :
              9412853 Cross  A major International Conference on the Application  of
              Ferroelectric Materials will be held August 7-10, 1994 at  Pennsylvania State
              University; University Park, PA. The  Con ference focuses on current topics in
              the synthesis, processing  and utilization of fer roelectrics in a variety of
              applications.   Piezoelectrics, Dielectrics, Electrostrictives, Pyroelectrics,
              and  Photorefractives are all covered from these perspectives in Plenary  and
              Regular Sessions, as well as in extensive Poster Sessions.   Arrangements have
              been made to allow for in-depth discus sions on  critical subject areas.  It is
              expected that top scientists in the  field will attend, and that the Conference
              sessions will provide an  effective forum to discuss and delineate critical
              scientific  issues, and to consider and define the approaches and techniques 
              needed to ad dress them.    %%% An evaluation of the status of the  general
              chemistry and physics of ferroelectrics from their basic  synthesis and
              processing to their utilization in applications, and  recommendations by the
              session participants for the emphasis of  future work, and their assessment of
              the most important  contem porary research issues will be of great value to the
               understanding and development of ferroelec tric and related  materials, and
              for their subsequent utilization in fields such as  microelectronics, and for
              their general applications as sensors and  actuators.       ***
