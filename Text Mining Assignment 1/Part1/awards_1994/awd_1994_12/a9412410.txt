Abstract    :
              Horia Metiu is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational
              Chemistry Program to continue his research in quantum   dynamics.  Three areas
              of research are being studied: 1) wave packet   interferometry is being
              extended to nonlinear spectroscopy as a sensitive   method for studying highly
              excited states; 2) a technique is being   developed for calculating photon
              absorption and Raman scattering cross   sections for systems with few quantum
              degrees embedded in a bath of   classical ones, e.g. an electron solvated in a
              zeolite; and 3) a time   dependent theory is being developed for treating
              exciton formation and   tunneling in confined semiconductor structures, e.g.
              quantum wells,   wires, dots and clusters.    There are many interesting
              biochemical, chemical and solid state systems   in which an electron interacts
              with a complex environment.  The   spectroscopy of the electron connects this
              interaction to observable   quantities and gives us a chance to understand the
              underlying dynamical   mechanisms.  Furthermore the properties of electrons and
              holes in   confined semiconductor structures are being extensively studied in
              the   hope of using them in opto-electronic and tunneling devices.  Metiu will 
               employ the techniques of time dependent quantum mechanics to study the  
              behavior of electrons, holes and excitons in these systems.  This work   will
              help to provide useful intuitive models for the behavior of these   complex
              systems.
