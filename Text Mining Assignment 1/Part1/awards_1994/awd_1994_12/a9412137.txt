Abstract    :
                This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              will assist the  Department of Chemistry at the Pennsylvania State University
              in the purchase of a parallel  computational facility using IBM SP2.  This
              equipment will enhance research in a number of  areas including the following: 
              (a) Quantum Chemistry, (b) Chemical Reactions Induced by  keV Particle
              Bombardment , (c) Solvation and Solvent Effects on Chemical Reaction, (d) 
              Interaction of Fusion Peptides and Fusion Inhibiting Peptides with Model Lipid
              Bilayers,  and (e) Simulations of Molecular Liquids and Absorbed Phases.      A
              workstation network of fast, modern computer workstations is a new way to
              satisfy the   computing needs of chemistry departments.  Such a "computer
              network" also serves as a   development environment for new theoretical codes
              and algorithms, provides state-of-the-art  graphics and visualization
              facilities and supports research in state-of-the-art applications of  parallel
              processing.
