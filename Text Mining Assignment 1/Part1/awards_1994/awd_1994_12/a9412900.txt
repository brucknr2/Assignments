Abstract    :
              Tufts University has teamed with Analog Devices, Raytheon  Corporation, Sipex
              Corporation, Analogic Corporation, and Cadence  Systems to retrain defense
              industry engineers in the design and  manufacture of "Mixed Signal" VLSI
              circuits combining analog and  digital technology into "systems on a chip" for
              both commercial and  defense applications.  This project features an internship
              program  combining in-class instruction and laboratory exercises, industrial 
              mentoring and classroom training given by industry representatives.   In
              addition, the industrial partners will employ trainees during  the program.
