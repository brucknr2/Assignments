Abstract    :
              9412705  Pandya       This summer faculty internship permits the investigators
              to be   involved in industrial designs, evolve their own realistic design  
              examples, incorporate such experiences in the Very Large Scale   Integrated
              Circuits (VLSI) courses taught at the university and   develop video tutorials
              useful for both the students and industry   engineers.       This project
              addresses the intermediate-level tasks and uses  two separate commercial tools
              for mapping from top-level design,  synthesis with
              pre-designed/vendor-supplied/custom-built modules,  optimization and
              back-annotation interfaces to low-level or  physical design.  This project's
              material is targeted to senior  undergraduate/graduate courses on VLSI System
              design.
