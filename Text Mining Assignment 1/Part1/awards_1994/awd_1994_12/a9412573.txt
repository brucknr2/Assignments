Abstract    :
              Under the direction of Professor Donna Haraway, Mr. Joseph Dumit is  producing
              an ethnographic study and contemporary history of  positron emission tomography
              (PET) functional brain imaging.  He is  combining intensive archival work and
              the collection of primary  oral histories with participant observation of PET
              centers and  popular culture content analysis.  He is focusing on 
              interdisciplinary interactions and the ways in which popular  theories of human
              nature and categories of persons interact with  the experimental production of
              scientific knowledge.  His thesis is  that functional brain imaging, through
              PET and other techniques, is  actively helping to redefine our notions of the
              interdisciplinary  negotiations involved in producing, distributing, and
              interpreting  functional images of living human brains. This study offers a 
              unique and much-needed contribution to understanding the  implications of the
              ongoing "biologization" of human nature in  science, medicine, popular
              theories, and in the legal system.  A  second objective is to make available to
              other researchers a basic  history of PET scanning by collecting primary
              sources and documents  and organizing a qualitative index to these materials. 
              These will  be stored in archives and made available electronically.
