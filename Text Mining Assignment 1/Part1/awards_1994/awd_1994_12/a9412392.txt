Abstract    :
              9412392  Slodkowski  The problems in this proposal are concerned with polynomial
                convex hulls and their applications. The proposer intends to   pursue his
              long term interest in polynomial hulls fibered over   the unit circle. he will
              concentrate especially on analyzing   the structure of polynomial hulls with
              non-connected fibers   and finding their new applications. He also plans to
              study   weak solutions of Levi equations in two or more dimensions and   their
              applications to description of polynomial hulls and   envelopes of holomorphy
              of submanifolds of n-dimensional   complex Euclidean space.  The role of
              mathematical analysis is to provide qualitative,   quantitative and geometric
              information concerning the   solutions of equations. When the equations are
              defined over   domains in several complex variables the approximation of  
              functions and solutions is complicated by the geometry of the   domain. This
              project studies this interplay between the   complex geometry and
              approximation. In particular, the project   will have application to the
              location of extreme values of   solutions to complex equations.  ***
