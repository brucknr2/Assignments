Abstract    :
              9412482  Colglazier    This grant to the National Academy of Sciences  NAS ,
              through the  Office for Central Europe and Eurasia of the National Research 
              Council  NRC , provides support from 1 May 1994 through 31  October 1994 for
              the Young Investigator Programs  YIPs  on:   Health Impacts of Environmental
              Degradation with the Czech and  Slovak Republics; Nuclear Accidents and
              Radioactive Contamination  with Ukraine and Belarus; and Ecological Concerns in
              the  Development of the Arctic and the Far Northern Regions with  Russia. 
              These YIPs are part of a larger series of programs  designed to initiate
              multi-disciplinary, collaborative research  among the new generation of
              scientists in the United States,  Central Europe, and the former Soviet Union,
              in fields of  national and global significance.  Each VIP consists of a two- 
              year summer program for ten American and ten foreign specialists.   Each
              program phase is three weeks in length, with one summer  session in the foreign
              country and the other in the United  States.  The NRC selects an
              interdisciplinary team of American  specialists through a national competition.
               To be eligible,  American applicants must have received their Ph.D. since
              1986.   The foreign specialists are chosen by carefully identified  foreign
              counterpart organizations.  These three YIPs began in  summer 1993 and will
              conclude with a three-week program in the  United States in summer 1994.  The
              U.S. Department of State has  provided support to cover the costs associated
              with the American  participants in the second phase.  ***
