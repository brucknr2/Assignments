Abstract    :
              9412964  Jenks  Iowa State University    The photochemistry and photophysics of
              aromatic sulfoxides will be studied. Three specific objectives will be pursued:
              (1) Elucidation of the photophysics of aromatic sulfoxides, including the
              nature of the excited states and mechanisms of intermolecular quenching, (2) A
              detailed study of the following photochemical reactions and primary mechanistic
              steps: stereochemical inversion at sulfur, a-cleavage, hydrogen atom
              abstraction, deoxygenation, and addition to olefins, (3) The design of classes
              of useful transformations based on mechanistic understanding of the reaction.
              The experimental studies will be coupled with molecular orbital calculations.  
               This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work of Professor
              William S. Jenks at Iowa State University. Photochemistry and Photophysics of a
              class of organic compounds will be studied. These compounds are characterized
              by having sulfur bonded to one oxygen atom and to a benzene-type group. The
              latter group is sometimes referred to as aromatic, and consists of six-carbon
              atoms bonded in a ring. The individual steps by which these compounds undergo
              reaction upon radiation with ultraviolet light will be investigated in detail.
              These studies will form the basis for the design of useful synthetic routes to
              complex organic molecules.
