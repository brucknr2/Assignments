Abstract    :
              A concurrent computational and experimental study will be conducted which
              focuses on explaining the physics of vortex breakdown through observing the
              kinematics of vortex lines of the flow, as well as their topology in bundles
              which constitute the vortex core.  To establish the importance of vortex
              tilting and stretching in vortex breakdown, axisymmetric swirling flows as well
              as those with elliptic cross sections will be studied.  To support the theory a
              novel experimental device is proposed which consists of a large Plexiglass
              sphere containing a smaller sphere and oil filling the large gap.  The inner
              sphere is suspended and spun magnetically.  The device allows for
              nonaxisymmetric spinning of the inner sphere and is fully  nonintrusive: 
              neither the hardware nor the visualization method (based on laser velocimetry)
              intrude  into the flow.  Vortex breakdown has proven to be a problem of
              fundamental interest with applications  to areas as diverse as air-traffic
              safety, flame holding in swirl combustors as well as supersonic  combustors,
              and laminar-flo w control.  A vast body of literature has been devoted to the
              study of  this phenomenon; however there is still no consensus as to its
              underlying physics.
