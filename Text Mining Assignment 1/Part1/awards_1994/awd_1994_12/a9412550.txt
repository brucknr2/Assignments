Abstract    :
              9412550 Alford  Research will be carried out to develop a  fundamental
              understanding of  the processes associated with the low  temperature oxidation
              of Silicon in contact with Cu silicide.   It  is planned to:  1) investigate
              the kinetics of the phenomena,  2)characterize the oxide layer, and 3)use the
              orientation  dependence on growth rate to form vertical isolation oxides in 
              integrated circuits.  We expect to characterize the growth kinetics  to obtain
              activation energy, substrate orientation, identity of  moving species through
              the use of implanted markers, and the  influence of dopants and impurities. 
              The integrity of the grown  oxide will be quantified by electrical measurements
              of metal oxide  capacitor structures, ion beam analysis of composition,
              density,  and impurities, and transmission electron microscopy to assess 
              microstructure properties. %%% The primary goal of this program is  to develop
              a fundamental understanding of the low temperature  oxidation of Silicon in
              contact with Cu silicide.  An important  feature of the project is the training
              of students in a  fundamentally and technologically significant area of
              materials and  processing research.  This research will contribute to improving
               the general perform ance of advanced devices and integrated  circuits used in
              computing, information processing, and  tele communica tions.  ***
