Abstract    :
              The Simulation and Modeling Group at AT&T Bell Laboratories has  recently
              created a circuit simulator for dc simulation of their in-  house integrated
              circuits.  This simulator, called SFRAME has a  number of advantages over
              Newton-Raphson-based simulation programs  such as SPICE.  These advantages
              include global convergence, the  ability to find more than one or sometimes
              even all of a circuit's  operating points, and the ability to incorporate the
              sophisticated  bipolar junction transistor models used at Bell Laboratories; 
              running SPICE on circuits incorporating these models has led to  severe
              convergence problems.    This research will affect major enhancements to
              SFRAME, including  initialization capability, ability to simulate circuits
              containing  MOS transistors, and identification of the stability of operating 
              points found.  It is expected that the work proposed herein will be  a starting
              point for a long and productive industry-university  collaboration.
