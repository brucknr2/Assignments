Abstract    :
              9412764  Lubkeman  The objective of this proposed project is to investigate and 
              develop a scheme to further automate the monitoring, recording,  and diagnosis
              of power disturbances for power quality studies,  using a combination of
              artificial neural network (ANN) and case-  based reasoning (CBR) approaches.   
              The proposed research is (a) to develop a scheme to automate the  data
              collection process of recorders--this involves an ANN  methodology for the
              classification of waveforms that are captured  and a rule-based relational
              database design for the effective  archival of data, and (b) to investigate the
              applicability of a  case-base reasoning approach towards aiding the diagnosis
              of  disturbances.  This research represents a step in the direction  of
              intelligent diagnostic and measurement tools using state-of-  the-art
              artificial intelligence technologies which are just  emerging.  It would be a
              significant improvement over present-day  recorders, providing for further
              automation of the measurement  and diagnosis of disturbances.  ***
