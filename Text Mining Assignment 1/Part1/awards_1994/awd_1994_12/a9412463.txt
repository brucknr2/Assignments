Abstract    :
              9412463  Reid    Dr. Reid, at Cal Tech, will participate on a collaborative
              project with Drs. Ian  Thompson and Steven Majewski, at the Carnegie
              Institution, which involves  the first systematic study of a classical
              starcount problem using modern  detectors.  Starcounts -- the stellar magnitude
              distribution as a function of  Galactic latitude and longitude -- have served
              as an effective probe of the  overall structure of our Galaxy for many years. 
              Despite considerable interest  in Galactic structure, little new starcount data
              have been published in the  past decade.  The aim of this project is to obtain
              deep, accurate observations  with state-of-the-art detectors to test and
              improve on an interim Galactic  model prepared by these researchers.  With a
              profusion of parameters that  define a starcount model (including the density
              laws, luminosity functions,  and three-dimensional form of each population and
              sub-population) further  observations are essential to test how well the
              interim model matches the  Galactic structure.  These researchers aim to
              produce a model of the Galaxy  which is globally self-consistent and physically
              interpretable.
