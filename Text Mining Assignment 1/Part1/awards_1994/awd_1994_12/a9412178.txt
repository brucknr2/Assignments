Abstract    :
              This proposal is for funds to purchase additional equipment to augment a present
              Ti: Sapphire  laser system for applications in a pump/probe and degenerate four
              wave mixing (DFWM) configurations.  The requested equipment will allow the
              development of a picosecond, mode locked laser based diagnostic which would
              make it possible to obtain high frequency turbulence statistics, to observe
              rapid transient events, and to analyze stability behavior of turbulent
              combustors through the measurement of species concentration and temperature on
              a very short time scale.  The effects of collisions should be minimized.
