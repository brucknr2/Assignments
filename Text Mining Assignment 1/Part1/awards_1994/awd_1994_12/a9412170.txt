Abstract    :
              Sojka  ATM-9412170  A workshop will be held near Boulder, Colorado, from June 
              27-29 to discuss research and experiments on ionospheric  plasma structures at
              middle and high latitudes.  This is the  second workshop convened by the HLPS
              (High Latitude Plasma  Structures) Working Group of the CEDAR program.  This 
              workshop will also include members of the GAPS (Global  Aspects of Plasma
              Structures) Working Group which is part of  the international Solar Terrestrial
              Energy Program (STEP).   The discussion topics will emphasize the modeling of
              middle  and high latitude macro- and meso-scale plasma structures.  ***
