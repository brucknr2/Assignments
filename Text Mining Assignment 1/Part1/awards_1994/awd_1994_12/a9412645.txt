Abstract    :
                 This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation
              Research Program.  It is a study of whites' racial attitudes and the
              appropriate scientific methodologies for measuring them, focusing on the fact
              that whites are more supportive of abstract principles of racial equality than
              they are of policies directed at achieving these goals.  This study
              investigates two explanations for this "policy/principle gap:"  1) survey
              research is not capturing true racial attitudes due to social desirability
              pressures to respond according to what are perceived to be the prevailing
              social norms;  2) models predicting a perfect relationship between principles
              and policies are inadequate, and additional attitudes, beliefs and values must
              be considered.  This study attaches fresh data collection and analysis to the
              on-going Detroit Area Study in order to address these questions.  %%%   The
              research engages important issues in both research methodology and sociological
              theory, and the results will contribute to the knowledge base concerning
              American racial tensions.  In addition to the scientific gains to be achieved
              by the research, this award will materially assist a highly promising student
              in completing research for the Ph.D. dissertation.  Thus it contributes to the
              future scientific manpower of the nation and the thorough training of the next
              generation of social scientists.
