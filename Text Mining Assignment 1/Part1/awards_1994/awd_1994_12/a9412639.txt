Abstract    :
              9412639  Famouri       The objectives of the proposed research are to develop a 
              mathematical and computer simulated model for permanent magnet  brushless DC
              machines, which have been targeted for use in electric  vehicles and hybrid
              electric vehicles.       Issues such as geometric complexities, configuration,
              armature  reaction effects and nonlinear characteristics of the ferromagnetic 
              materials will be addressed in the development of the model.         The
              approach will be a nonlinear mathematical modeling.  It is  anticipated that
              the magnetic filed will be solved by use of  finite-element techniques.      
              Once an algorithm is developed to obtain the model, the  accuracy of the model
              will be evaluated and compared with actual  machines.       The development
              methodologies are expected to extend beyond  the model of permanent magnet DC
              motors to models of the other  electric machines and electrical systems.  ***
