Abstract    :
              This proposal is for funds to purchase an intensified CCD Camera to replace
              obsolete equipment.  It will be used in the following research activities: 2-D
              imaging of liquid and vapor phase fuel concentration measurements in IC
              engines, using fluorescence techniques; 2-D imaging of Raman scattering for
              major species concentration and temperature measurements; and the development
              of new fluorescent dopant system for fuel imaging.
