Abstract    :
              9412821  Fornaess    This award supports dissertation enhancement in mathematics
              and  travel to France of Gregery Buzzard, a graduate student of Jon-  Erik
              Fornaess at the University of Michigan.  Mr. Buzzard will  collaborate with
              leading French mathematicians in the field of  complex dynamical systems at the
              University of Paris (Sud),  Orsay. The visit takes advantage of his thesis
              advisor's long-  standing collaboration with French mathematicians, Nessim
              Sibony,  Michael Herman, and Jean-Christophe Yoccoz.    Mr. Buzzard's primary
              research interest is in complex analysis of  several variables and in dynamics
              in several complex variables.   He plans to study the density of hyperbolic
              dynamics of  polynomials in higher dimensions. The University of Paris is 
              considered an international center of activity in complex  dynamics.  The
              exposure to a new (French) perspective will  advance Mr. Buzzard's research and
              establish a foundation for  future collaboration with this group.  ***
