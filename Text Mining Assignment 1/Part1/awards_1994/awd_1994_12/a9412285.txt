Abstract    :
              9412285  Sites  Coral snakes (Elapidae:Micrurus) constitute a large and colorful
              group of highly neurotoxic New World snakes that attain high species diversity
              in the tropics and have served as models for a variety of studies of mimicry. 
              Recent studies of their phylogenetic (genealogical) relationships have failed
              in many respects; species groups have only been tentatively identified and
              remain weakly supported.  The present study will address this problem using a
              combination of morphological, isozyme, and mtDNA sequence data.  Its second
              objective will be to develop a hypothesis about the history of change in venom
              biochemistry within this group of snakes using 10-12 commonly assayed venom
              enzymes.  This hypothesis will provide a framework for additional natural
              history and venom toxicity studies of the species within an ecological context.
