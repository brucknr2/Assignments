Abstract    :
                          Project Summary  Clegg, James S.  9412883  The Bodega Marine
              Laboratory (BML) is a research unit of the  University of California (UC
              located on the Sonoma coast 80  miles north San Francisco.  Since 1966 the
              Laboratory has  provided unique opportunities for field research on a rich 
              floral and fauna in close proximity to the Laboratory  buildings.  BML has
              well-equipped laboratories, and  excellent seawater system, strong on-site
              support staff and  a firm commitment from the Davis campus to continue 
              developing the facilities and support needed by the growing  number of resident
              and visiting researchers.  The Laboratory  is located on the Bodega Marine
              Reserve (BMR), A 362-arce  protected field site with a diverse set of marine
              and  terrestrial coastal habitats.  Adjacent subtidal areas are  protected and
              available for study within the Bodega Marine  Life Refuge.    The Research
              programs of visiting scientists and graduate  students have been constrained in
              recent years by the lack  of adequate laboratory and office space. 
              Fortunately, a new  expansion building is under construction (UC funds) that 
              will rectify this problem.  However, the lack of adequate  housing for visitors
              is becoming an ever worsening problem  as requests for use of the site for
              research and instruction  continue to increase.  The project will provide
              support for  new housing unit that will remedy this situation, and  provide a
              suitable balance between Laboratory facilities and  the ability to accommodate
              the housing needs of visitors.
