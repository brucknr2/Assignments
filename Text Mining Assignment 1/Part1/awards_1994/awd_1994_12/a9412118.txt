Abstract    :
              IBN- 9412118  Gilbert, Ryan and Deinert                              Abstract   
                                            Darwin originally proposed two types of selection
              that could  affect animals.  Both are complicated phenomena that we  continue
              to struggle to understand fully.  In this doctoral  dissertation research,
              Gilbert, Ryan and Deinert have  identified a system in which the evolutionary
              dynamics of  both types of selection can be studied in detail.  A series  of
              experiments on competition between males and on mate  choice by males will
              further our knowledge of how different  types of selection interact in the
              evolutionary process.
