Abstract    :
              IBN-9412109  Joseph Martin    The goal of this research is to understand how
              thyroid hormones influence the adult mammalian brain. In adulthood, the
              metabolic rate of many cell types is accelerated when thyroid hormones enter
              the tissue. This is not true of brain cells. However, some of the most serious
              consequences of excess secretion of thyroid hormones include changes in sleep
              patterns and induction of seizures. Preliminary evidence from the PI's
              laboratory indicates that thyroid hormone in the brain may bind to GABA-A
              receptors. These GABA-A receptors are proteins on the outside membranes of
              nerve cells that are responsible for the inhibitory effects of
              gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a chemical messenger between nerve cells.
              Studies will be performed in rats to determine the effects of thyroid hormones
              on the GABA-A receptor binding, the subsequent effects of this binding on the
              responses of the nerve cells and the resultant electroencephalogram (scalp
              recordings of brain waves that show changes in brain activity such as those
              that occur during sleep or seizures). These studies will determine the
              biological significance of the action of thyroid hormone on brain tissue as
              compared to its action on other tissues in the body.
