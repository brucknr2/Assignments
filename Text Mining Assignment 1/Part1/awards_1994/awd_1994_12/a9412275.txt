Abstract    :
              IBN 94-12275  Marler & Partan                              Abstract             
                                  Animals often communicate using both sight and sound. 
              Analysis of this use of two modalities presents substantial  procedural
              difficulties.  In her doctoral dissertation  research, Ms. Sarah R. Partan will
              take a very exciting new  approach to this problem by using TV and audio tape. 
              This  offers the enormous advantage of allowing experimental  control over the
              presentation of information in the two  modalities both separately and
              simultaneously.  This will  allow Ms. Partan to begin to determine how
              information is  combined across modalities during the process of animal 
              communication, thus making an important contribution to the  study of animal
              communication..
