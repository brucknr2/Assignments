Abstract    :
              Spanos 9412576  This project Supports travel to the Second International
              Conference on Computational Stochastic Mechanics to be held in Athens, Greece
              on 13-15 June 1994.  this conference aims to be a forum for bringing together
              the two fields of computational and stochastic mechanics.  It will provide a
              unique opportunity for exchanging ideas on the status of computational methods
              as they are applied to stochastic analysis of a broad spectrum of problems of
              theoretical and applied mechanics.  the conference theme encompasses:  Boundary
              Elements Aerospace Engineering Control    Earthquake Engineering Differential
              Equations  Environmental Engineering Fatigue and Fracture   Geotechnical
              Engineering Finite Elements  Hydraulic Engineering Monte Carlo Simulation
              Marine and Offshore Engineering Optimization Structural Engineering Random
              Fields Transportation engineering Reliability Vehicle Engineering Vibrations
              Wind Engineering
