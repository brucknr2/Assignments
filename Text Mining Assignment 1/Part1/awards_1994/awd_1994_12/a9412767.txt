Abstract    :
                This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              will assist the  Department of Chemistry at the University of Colorado--Boulder
              in the purchase of a IBM RS  6000/590 computer.  This equipment will enhance
              research in a number of areas including the  following:  Studies of the
              reactions of ions with neutral molecules in the gas phase; Ab initio 
              electronic structure calculations; and Biradical-like Reactive Intermediates.  
               A workstation network of fast, modern computer workstations is a new way to
              satisfy the   computing needs of chemistry departments.  Such a "computer
              network" also serves as a   development environment for new theoretical codes
              and algorithms, provides state-of-the-art  graphics and visualization
              facilities and supports research in state-of-the-art applications of  parallel
              processing.
