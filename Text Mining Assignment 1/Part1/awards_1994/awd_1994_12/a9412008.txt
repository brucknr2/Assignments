Abstract    :
              9412008  Richardson  A high-resolution atomic force microscope will be
              purchased.  This instrument is urgently needed to sustain rapid progress in the
              development of high resolution x-ray microscopy.  X-ray microscopy is now a
              pivotal core technology to the use of in-vitro analysis of sub-cellar features
              of biological structures each as human chromosomes, and to the development of
              x-ray assayiny techniques for computer chip manufacture.  We have established
              at the Laser Plasma Laboratory (LPL) at CREOL, the only university development
              program in the these technologies that is based on the promising use of compact
              laser plasma sources.  Six faculty members and over 15 graduate and
              undergraduate students are associated with this program.  In the past year, our
              success in establishing a dedicated laser plasma x-ray microscopy facility has
              resulted in the wide recognition of the potential this technology, and broad
              interest expressed by a large number of researchers, in this country and
              abroad, in partnering with us to bring this technology to the threshold for
              commercial development.  Moreover, to encourage the latter, we are now
              collaborating with a number of American companies who wish to exploit this
              technology.  ***
