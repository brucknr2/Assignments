Abstract    :
                    This  is  an award under the Grants for Improving  Doctoral  Dissertation
              Research program.  It is a study of the determinants  of  the adoption by
              American corporations of specific programs to  reduce  the  conflict between
              work and family obligations.   Data  will  be  collected from existing
              reference sources  and  through  telephone interviews with corporate human
              resource departments in  order to carry out an event history analysis of the
              factors  that  trigger the establishment of corporate family programs.       
              As  the  proportion of married women in the work force  has  increased
              dramatically, the problems of juggling family and  work  obligations have
              increased.  Some corporations have responded  by  establishing on-site day
              care, flexible work schedules, and other  family  programs, while others have
              done very little along  these  lines.   There is a pressing need to understand
              what factors  are  most  likely  to  lead to the establishment of  corporate 
              family  programs, a need this project will help to fill.  In addition  to  the 
              scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this  award  will  materially
              assist a highly promising student in  completing  research for the Ph.D.
              dissertation.  Thus it contributes to  the  future  scientific  manpower  of 
              the  nation  and  the  thorough  training of the next generation of social
              scientists.
