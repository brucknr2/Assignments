Abstract    :
              9415564  McKee    A weeklong international conference entitled "The Physics of
              the Interstellar  Medium and the Intergalactic Medium" is planned for June
              20-24, 1994 to  take place at the Elba International Physics Center, Marciana,
              Marina, on the  island of Elba, Italy.  The meeting is intended to be a
              once-per-decade event  which will review the theory and observations of the
              fundamental physical  processes occurring in the interstellar and intergalactic
              mediums.  This  gathering will be unique in providing an opportunity for
              mutually beneficial  interaction between the older and more developed
              disciplines associated with  the study of interstellar matter in our own galaxy
              and the new and emerging  disciplines associated with the study of
              intergalactic matter and cosmology.
