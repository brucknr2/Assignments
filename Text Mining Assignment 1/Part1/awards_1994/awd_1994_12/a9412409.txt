Abstract    :
              Project Summary  Khazanov/ATM-9412409         This research will investigate a
              linear stage of the plasma  wave generation in the ionosphere-plasmasphere
              system due to the  presence of superthermal electrons.  The PIs will accomplish
              this  investigation through their continuing development of the kinetic  theory
              of superthermal electrons in the ionosphere and  plasmasphere.  The research
              will include the following tasks:  (1)  conducting a numerical study of the
              non-steady-state Boltzmann-  Landau kinetic equation for superthermal electrons
              in the  ionosphere and plasmasphere along open and closed geomagnetic field 
              lines, (2) incorporating the non-steady-state ionospheric-  plasmaspheric
              coupling of the superthermal electrons in a time-  dependent transport model of
              plasma flows, (3) considering an  electrodynamical aspect of the
              non-steady-state transport of  superthermal electrons and including the effects
              of the electron  distribution function in the formation of a self-consistent 
              electrostatic potential in the space plasma, and (4) exploring the  linear
              theory of plasma wave generation in the ionosphere-  plasmasphere system due to
              the presence of superthermal electrons.
