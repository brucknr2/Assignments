Abstract    :
              9412606  Lambright  This project will prepare a case history of the U.S. Global
              Change  Research Program (USGCRP).  The study will combine and use  appropriate
              social science concepts in a political constructionist  approach.  This
              approach focuses on political and policy processes,  examining the roles of key
              actors in governmental processes that  require networking and strategies.  A
              major issue in this effort is  the negotiation of boundaries between science
              and policy -- and  scientists and politicians.  Recognition of this form of 
              negotiation is the contribution of social constructionism.  The  USGCRP is one
              of the largest and most extensive research efforts in  the federal government. 
              Begun in 1987, it has grown to have a $1.5  billion budget, spread through at
              least nine agencies.  The first  official "Presidential Initiative," it later
              became the first  designated multi-agency endeavor intended both to build good 
              science and usefully serve policymakers.  While criticized for  weakness in
              policy relevance, it nevertheless is also being  expanded and used by the
              Clinton Administration as a model for  other major national research
              initiatives that cut across agencies.   Understanding the forces that have
              shaped USGCRP, particularly the  mechanism that governed the program -- the
              interagency Committee on  Earth and Environmental Sciences (CEES) -- will
              provide some  lessons for national research policy for other endeavors. 
              Results  from this project will include presentations, articles and a book.
