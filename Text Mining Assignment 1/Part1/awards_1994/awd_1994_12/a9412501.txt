Abstract    :
              9412501  Hahn  Partial support is provided for a workshop on the current issues 
              and opportunities in mechanics and materials of sliding and  rolling contact. 
              Active researchers from the tribo-materials  field and from the contact
              mechanics field will bridge the gap  between the two approaches to the same
              general topic, will define  the most promising future areas of research and
              development, and  will explore joint research topics.  ***
