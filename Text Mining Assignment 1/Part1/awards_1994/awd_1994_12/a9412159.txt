Abstract    :
              9412159  IVES       Although diseases are common in many natural animal 
              populations, it is very difficult to document their effects on  population
              abundances because their effects are often subtle and  they often act in
              concert with other processes controlling  population densities.  This study
              will investigate the sublethal  effects of two types of disease on populations
              of mountain spiny  lizards (Sceloperus jarrovii).  Animals in the natural
              populations  will be medically treated to cure them of intestinal worm 
              parasites, malaria, or both with an additional group of lizards  left as
              controls.  Subsequently, their growth rate, survival, and  fecundity will be
              measured.  Additional studies will be conducted  on the physiological
              performances of infected versus uninfected  lizards.  Studying the effects of
              disease in natural populations is  important, because disease could be a major
              impediment to the  survival of numerous endangered species.
