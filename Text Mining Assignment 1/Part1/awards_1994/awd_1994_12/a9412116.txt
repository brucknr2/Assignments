Abstract    :
              IBN-9412116  Ramirez  Sex steroids, including progesterone, modify specific
              tissues in  the body by binding to unique proteins called nuclear steroid 
              receptors andactivating specific genes in the cells of that tissue.  Dr.
              Ramirez is studying how the sex hormone progesterone exerts its  action upon
              the central nervous system (CNS) of female and male  rats. In the CNS,
              progesterone appears to bind to specific binding  sites on the membranes,
              indicating that progesterone, besides  acting on the genes of the cells, can
              also alter the function of  neurons by binding to the cell membrane.
              Progesterone appears to  bind to a membrane progesterone receptor that is
              unique to the CNS  of female rats since it is not functionally active in the
              CNS of  male rats. The specific objectives of this study are: 1) to study  the
              characteristics of the membrane binding sites in membranes  isolated from
              different regions of the brain, 2) to isolate and  characterize a protein from
              the cerebellum of the brain that may be  the membrane progesterone receptor,
              and 3) to demonstrate that this  membrane progesterone receptor in the CNS is
              regulated by the  estrous cycle of the female rat. The unambiguous proof of the
               existence of membrane molecules from the CNS that bind progesterone  will help
              to clarify some of the actions of steroids upon mood and  behavior.
