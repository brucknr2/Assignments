Abstract    :
              9412918  Hockfield    This award provides primarily scholarships for graduate 
              students and postdoctoral researchers to attend a two-week  lecture and
              laboratory course in Computational  Neuroscience:  Vision to be given at Cold
              Spring Harbor  Laboratory in July 1994.  Twenty-four students will be  accepted
              for the course, mostly graduate students and  postdoctoral researchers in
              visual neuroscience, computer  vision, and visual psychophysics.  The aim is to
              provide  intensive instruction in the application of computational  techniques
              to a variety of problems in visual science in  which these methods have proved
              fruitful for  interdisciplinary investigations.  The course is unique as  it
              brings together lecturers, graduate students and  postdoctoral researchers who
              share an interest in vision but  have diverse backgrounds including expertise
              in artificial  intelligence, psychophysics, computational neuroscience, 
              cognitive neuroscience, and retinal and visual system  neurophysiology.  This
              provides the participants with both  exposure to other perspectives and
              possibilities for  developing new collaborations.
