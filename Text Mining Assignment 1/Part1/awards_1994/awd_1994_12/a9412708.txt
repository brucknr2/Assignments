Abstract    :
              9412708  Shankar       This summer faculty internship permits the investigators
              to  work with industrial designs, evolve their own realistic design  examples,
              incorporate such experiences into the Very Large Scale  Integrated (VLSI)
              courses taught at the university and develop  video tutorials useful for both
              the students and the industry  engineers.       This project uses a commercial
              package for top-down design and  simulation and a commercial suite of custom
              VLSI tools for bottom-  up design.  This project's materials is targeted to two
              junior  undergraduate courses in computer architecture and VLSI.
