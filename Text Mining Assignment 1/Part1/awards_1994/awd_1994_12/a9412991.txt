Abstract    :
              9412991  Bradley       The principal objective of this project is to interact
              with  industrial personnel during the development of a model-based  knowledge
              system for casting design and manufacturability  assessment.  The work will
              extend and integrate ongoing applied and  fundamental research within a
              framework for the intelligent design  and production of castings.  Key elements
              of the project include  object-orientation to model the casting process; 
              feature-based  design; integration of process control and casting design; and 
              industry-university interaction within the foundry environment.         By
              integrating design and manufacturing, the model-based  knowledge system will
              facilitate concurrent engineering and lead to  more productive interaction
              among foundry personnel and between the  foundry and its customers.  This will
              help ensure the  manufacturability of customer designs prior to costly
              production  trials, improve productivity and product quality.
