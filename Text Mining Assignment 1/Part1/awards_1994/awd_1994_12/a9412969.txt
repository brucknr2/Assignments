Abstract    :
              9412869  Raikhel       This proposal requests support for a new Keystone 
              Symposia on Plant Cell Biology: Mechanism, Molecular  Machinery, Signals and
              Pathways to be held at Taos, New  Mexico, January 7-13, 1995.  The Organizers
              of the Symposia  are Natasha Raikhel, Michigan State University, East  Lansing,
              and Chris Lamb, Salk Institute, La Jolla.  The  contributed talks and
              discussion sessions will highlight  recent progress in plant cell biology and
              will bring  together scientists studying plant cells from a different 
              perspective.  This is a rapidly developing area of plant  science and there is
              a lot of room for young people to learn  and contribute.  The specific section
              that the Symposia  addresses are: cell surface and the extracellular matrix,; 
              cell adhesion , cytoskeleton and the recognition process;  plasmodesmata and
              nuclear pores; cell division; membrane  signaling; tonoplast and plasma
              membrane; endoplasmic  reticulum; plastids; cytoplasmic regulatory mechanisms; 
              signaling to the nucleus; transport vesicles; heath shock  proteins and
              molecular chaperones.  To maximize the personal  interactions an attendance
              limit of 300 has been set.  %%%  The Keystone Symposia format will provide a
              unique forum for  sustained, focused, in depth discussion of emerging topics 
              that are critical to the understanding of the unique  properties of plant
              cells.  The symposium will bring  together in addition of established
              scientists, as many  young, talented scientists as possible.  The conference
              will  be distinctly different from other s in the field because it  focuses on
              functional plant cell biology.  The funds  requested are mainly to bring
              graduate students to the  Symposium.    ***
