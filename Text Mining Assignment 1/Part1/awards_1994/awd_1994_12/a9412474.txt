Abstract    :
              9412474  Weis  High resolution seismic sensing could improve earth-drilling
              safety  and efficiency, and provide a better exploration tool for  geophysics. 
              To achieve high spatial resolutions (on the order of  1 m) a seismic detector
              must have a frequency response up to about  2 kHz.  Detectors made of fiber
              Bragg gratings should provide the  required frequency response and be simpler,
              and more rugged than  prior detectors.  The immediate goals of this project are
              to  design, fabricate, and test a prototype borehole seismic detection  system
              using optical fiber-Bragg-gratings.  The longer term goals  of this project
              are:  (1) build and test an array of fiber-grating  seismic sensors, (2) refine
              the proposed seismic detection system,  (3) establish a working relationship
              between RockBit International  Inc. (RBI) and the faculty investigator, and (4)
              work together with  RBI on further applications of optical fiber sensors to
              borehole  and measurement-while-drilling (MWD) sensing.    This project will be
              significant in at least three ways.  First,  the proposed seismic detector will
              be simple, reliable, easily  multiplexed, and potentially less expensive than
              present detectors.   Second, it will allow the faculty investigator and an
              undergraduate  student to learn the problems and challenges of a local 
              manufacturing company.  Third, it will provide "real-world"  engineering
              examples for instructional motivation in the classroom.  ***
