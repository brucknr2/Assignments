Abstract    :
              9412430 Peterson   This project will develop the software and neurobiological
              connections that are important to making progress in the areas of real-time
              learning and control.  The research will focus on methods using the Pontryagin
              optimality and Hamilton-Jacob-Bellman (HJB) equation in conjunction with
              on-line ( or real-time) measurements of state data to build local models of
              control law.  These techniques share the spirit of the adaptive-critic
              methodologies for construction of models of the control law, but are tightly
              bound to the premise of real-time problems.   The focus here is on pertinent
              refinements and extensions of these techniques in three major arenas:
              theoretical analysis, locally scoped artificial neural architecture and object
              oriented software architecture design.    General software code using C++
              language will be developed to support these research efforts.  The graphical
              interface will be designed using X windows with the Motif widget set.  The
              software environment will then be tested on problem domains of interest, e.g.
              reduced order model of Large Space Structures (LSS) and flexible robotic arms.
