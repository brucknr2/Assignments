Abstract    :
              9412769  Technical Abstract:  The research on this renewal grant will focus on
              transverse        dynamics and relxation of Fermi systems. The main theoretical
               objectives are to obtain macroscopic equation for spin dynamics  at finite
              temperatures, study zero-temperature attenuation in  longitudinal dynamics,
              apply the theory to itinerant magnetic  systems and study the zero-temperature
              attenuation in Heisenberg  models.  In addition, the boundary effects will be
              studied by  reducing the problem to an equivalent problem of random 
              imperfections.    Non-Technical Abstract:  This is a continuation of the work
              on transverse spin dynamics  in spin-polarized Fermi liquids at zero and finite
              temperature.  The previous work of quantum liquids will be extended to metallic
               and itinerant magnets.
