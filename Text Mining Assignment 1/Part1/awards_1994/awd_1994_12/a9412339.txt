Abstract    :
              9412339  Hansen         The most common model used in applied econometrics to
              study  the properties of time series is the "unit root model."  A  multivariate
              generalization of univariate unit roots which allows  for common unit root
              components is the model of cointegration.   In most applications, testing for
              unit roots or cointegration are  viewed as useful preliminary steps in the
              building of an  empirical models.  But in many cases, cointegration emerges as
              an  implication of an economic model and cointegration tests can be  used to
              directly test the model.  Examples include studies of the  life-cycle model,
              the present value model of stock prices, real  business cycle models, models of
              the term structure of interest  rates, a model of intertemporal consumption,
              and the long-run  money demand function.  But unit root and cointegration tests
              can  not be used for many economic applications because they are not  powerful
              enough to discriminate among competing hypotheses given  the typical number of
              observations available in economic data.    This project develops a method for
              increasing the power of unit  root and cointegration tests dramatically by
              using information  that is ignored by more conventional methods, generalizes
              this  method to all cases, uses the technique of local-to-unity  asymptotics to
              investigate the adequacy of the asymptotic  approximations in finite samples,
              and reexamines the Nelson-  Plosser data set to see if the improved tests can
              shed light on  the stochastic properties of the series.
