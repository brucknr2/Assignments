Abstract    :
                  During  development, gonadal steroids (androgens  and  estrogens)  confer 
              permanent  sex-specific differences  (sexual  dimorphism)  onto  the 
              organization and function of the  brain.  This  sexual  dimorphism in the
              brain, in turn, leads to production of behavior  that  is different in male and
              female animals. The estrogens  and  androgens act during a very specific and
              limited period in  early  development to induce these permanent sex-specific
              differences in  brain structure and in behavior. The best studied brain
              structure  which  is both sexually dimorphic and is known to be critical  in 
              mediating sex-specific behavior is the hypothalamus. We know that  much  of 
              the information transfer in neurons in the hypothalamus  depends  upon  the 
              presence of a class of proteins  called  GABA  (gamma-aminobutyric acid)
              receptors. The goal of this work is  to  determine  if  androgens and estrogens
              act during  this  critical  period  in early development to alter the types of
              GABA receptors  that  are  expressed  in the hypothalamus  and  to  determine 
              if  steroid-dependent  changes in GABA receptor  expression  lead  to  changes 
              in sex-specific behaviors in adult animals. The  results  from this study may
              help us to understand how development in  the  brain is regulated to produce
              sex-specific behaviors.
