Abstract    :
              9412416  This grant is supported jointly by the Materials Theory Program in  the
              Division of Materials Research and the Mathematical Physics  Activity in the
              Physics Division.  The theoretical research  concerns several different
              mechanisms that may play a role in  generating spatial or temporal order in
              systems governed by simple  dynamical rules.  The emphases are on controlling
              chaos in high-  frequency systems and spatiotemporally complex systems and on 
              coherent global oscillations and self-organized critical  correlations in
              slowly driven dynamical systems.  Immediate goals  include a more complete
              understanding of a novel technique for  controlling chaos using continuous
              feedback, the development of  tests for detecting this type of control
              mechanism in natural  systems, and the analysis of simple models of sandpiles
              that  exhibit global oscillations and novel forms of self-organized  critical
              behavior.  %%%  This theoretical research is in the general area of nonlinear 
              science and is jointly supported by the Physics and Materials  Research
              Divisions.  The work focuses on a class of problems which  are governed by
              simple local rules.  The work may impact the design  of individual
              semiconductor laser devices, the design of feedback  mechanisms for inducing
              coherence in arrays of such lasers or  arrays of Josephson junctions, and
              better methods for  characterizing the instabilities observed in natural
              dynamical  systems ranging from cardiac chaos to avalanches in granular 
              materials.
