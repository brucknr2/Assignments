Abstract    :
              9412611  Levine         This is a group travel project to assist American 
              participants in the thirteenth World Congress of Sociology, to be  held in
              Bielefeld, Germany, July 18-23, 1994.  The major  conference of the
              International Sociological Association, the  World Congress occurs at four-year
              intervals and attracts  approximately 5,000 participants.  Review of individual
              requests  for travel awards, selection of recipients, and the distribution  of
              funds will be the responsibility of the American Sociological  Association. 
              Competitive criteria for an award include an  invitation or acceptance of a
              paper, the scientific merit of the  paper, and the qualifications of the
              applicant.  %%%       Support for travel of U.S. sociologists permits continued
               growth of international exchange and collaboration in sociology.   This
              project is particularly timely, given the necessity to  promote international
              collaboration on global social processes  and transformations, especially those
              relating to understanding  the causes and consequences of democratization.
