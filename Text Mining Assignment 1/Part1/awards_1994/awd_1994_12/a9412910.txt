Abstract    :
              9412910  Schlosser  The proposed work is the collection and analysis of seawater
               samples for tritium and helium on an oceanographic cruise of the  RVIB
              Nathaniel B. Palmer to the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas in  early 1994. 
              This region has been sparsely sampled in the past, and  little is known about
              the regional oceanographic processes.    The specific objectives of this cruise
              are to investigate the  large-scale oceanographic features, study the evolution
              of the  surface mixed layer and pycnocline in relation to the sea ice cover 
              and the underlying intermediate and deep water masses, determine  the location
              of the Antarctic Slope Front, and to investigate the  impact of warm
              circumpolar water flowing onto the continental  shelf.  Tritium is particularly
              useful in determining the rate of  penetration of continental shelf waters into
              deep oceanic basins,  while helium, in combination with oxygen isotopes, is a
              unique  tracer for water derived from the basal melting of ice shelves.    The
              proposed work complements these objectives of the cruise, since  the physical
              and chemical characteristics of tritium and helium are  well known and well
              suited for the investigation of subsurface  water mass formation and water
              circulation.  Knowledge of the  distribution of trace elements in the ocean
              broadens the time and  space scales of the direct observations, and allows
              inferences  about oceanic processes that go beyond the immediate limits of the 
              cruise.  ***
