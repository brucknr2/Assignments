Abstract    :
              9412783  Hawley           ABSTRACT    Education and Training Program in
              Composite Materials for DoD and Durable Goods Industries    Michigan State
              University (MSU) and the University of Delaware (UD) will develop new
              courseware and software to advance the dual-use potential of low-cost composite
              manufacturing.  Education delivery mechanisms to be used include computer-based
              simulations and interactive learning, broadcasting of classes over satellite
              networks, and workshops on design and processing of composites.  Resources
              available to the universities include the National Science Foundation's Center
              for Polymer Processing at MSU and the Center for Composite Materials at UD,
              sponsored by the Army Research Office.  These centers are also supported by
              large industrial consortia, and have excellent research and manufacturing
              facilities.  Industry involvement in this effort will include guest lectures
              and planning workshops.  ***
