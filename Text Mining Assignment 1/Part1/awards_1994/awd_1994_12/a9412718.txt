              Alo  This project is designed to strengthen the research and related
              educational activities in computer and information science and engineering at
              minority institutions without doctoral programs.  For the twenty-five selected
              institutions, it provides funds for Visitation Programs by recognized computer
              scientists, engineers and educators who can respond to the needs of the program
              proposal submitted by the institution to the Program Committee and who will
              establish a working relationship with the institution that is expected to
              extend beyond the period supported by this grant.  The project includes a
              strong evaluation component that extends throughout the period of the grant.
