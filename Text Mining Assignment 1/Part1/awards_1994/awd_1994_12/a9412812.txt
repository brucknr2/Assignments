Abstract    :
                  9412812  Naaman  The main goal of the workshop is to provide a forum for
              discussion,  primarily among specialist, as to the latest developments, to 
              identify research needs, and to suggest directions to follow.  The  following
              issues are included in the scope of the workshop: 1)   Constitutive modeling of
              composite mechanical and fracture  properties, 2)  aspects of modeling at the
              macro, meso, and micro  levels, 3)  incorporation of the bond stress vs. slip
              relationship  in analytical models, 4) analysis of cyclic and reversed cyclic 
              response, 5)  improved manufacturing and production processes  compatible with
              high performance, 6)  rational testing and  meaningful test standards, 7)  the
              use in combination with  reinforcing bars and prestressing tendons, and 8)  the
               interrelationships of causes and effects between tailored composite 
              properties and required performance in structural and non-  structural
              applications.
