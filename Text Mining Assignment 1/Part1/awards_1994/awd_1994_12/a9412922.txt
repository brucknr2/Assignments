Abstract    :
                9412922  Baker      This planning grant award is oriented to the investigation
              of a  knowledge-based scientific visualization assisting system with the 
              purpose of providing intelligent assistance to a user upon the  description of
              the type of data, the analysis of the task, and the  system environment for the
              visualization project for which the  advice is sought.  The paradigm of
              task-directed visualization  involves the automatic construction of the
              visualization for the  task that has been described.  This planning
              investigation involves  understanding the types of tasks for which scientists
              use  visualization, as well as the relation between the task and the 
              effectiveness of different visual displays.  Empirical studies are  carried out
              as part of this planning to determine the relative  effectiveness of different
              visualizations of different tasks from  a collection of tasks reflecting common
              analysis goals of the  visualization-user to be incorporated in the rules of
              the automated  visualization assistant.
