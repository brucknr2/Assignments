Abstract    :
                  The goal of this study is to understand the relationships between  motivated
               behaviors, such as feeding, drinking,  aggression  and  sexual    behaviors,  
              and   the   chemistry   of   the    brain.  Neurotransmitters  are  chemicals 
              released  by  nerve  cells  to  communicate   with   other   nerve   cells.  
              Dopamine    is    a  neurotransmitter thought to be involved in motivation and
              reward.  In  this  study the relationships between changes  in  levels  of 
              dopamine  and  the expression of the motivational  components  of  sexual 
              behavior  in  female hamsters will be examined.  Dopamine  will  be  sampled
              from specific parts of the brain  to  determine  which  attributes of the male
              effectively contribute to the  rise  in  dopamine levels, what effects prior
              sexual experience have on  the  response  to  the  male,  and  whether 
              conditioned  stimuli  associated  with sexual behavior will induce a rise in 
              dopamine.  Studies will be also be done to identify the nerve cells  in  the 
              brain that release this dopamine. The results of this study  will  contribute
              to our understanding of the role of dopamine in sexual  behavior.  The  results
              of the study could  also  have  important  implications  for our understanding
              of drug abuse, since  several  types of additive drugs have dopamine-like
              action on brain cells.
