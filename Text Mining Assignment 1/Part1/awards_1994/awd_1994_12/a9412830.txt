Abstract    :
              9412830  Caulton  Indiana Univ. - Bloomington  Dr. Kenneth G. Caulton, Chemistry
              Department, University of Indiana at Bloomington, is supported by the
              Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
              Division for an investigation of the structure and function of hydrogen ligands
              which are attached to catalytically active late transition metals. Methods of
              forming complexes of osmium, platinum, and rhodium which contain hydride and
              dihydrogen ligands will be developed. The kinetics and thermodynamics of ligand
              binding and exchange, and the mechanism of magnetic exchange within these
              molecules will be evaluated. Attempts will be made to extend dihydrogen
              coordination to new metals and to new oxidation states. The results of these
              studies will be utilized to design new catalysts for, in particular, olefin
              hydration.    Hydrogen molecules may become activated by interacting metal
              atoms. This property has been exploited for a long time in both laboratory and
              industrial chemistry to increase the ability of hydrogen to undergo many
              reactions. In another respect, the interactions between hydrogen and metals has
              become an important topic with the increased interest in hydrogen as a clean
              fuel. This project will evaluate the fundamental ways in which hydrogen becomes
              attached to a metal. Using this data, new compounds containing hydrogen will be
              designed and a new method of performing the industrially very important
              addition of water to an unsaturated organic compound, i.e. "olefin hydration",
              will be developed.
