Abstract    :
              The Principal Investigator (PI) plans to assemble a quadruple mass spectrometer
              for assisting with mechanistic studies of chemical vapor deposition (CVD)
              processes.  The vacuum system for the spectrometer is to include two stages of
              differential pumping to allow in-situ sampling of gas phase species from CVD
              systems under reaction conditions.  The system will be assembled as a portable
              unit with an adjustable sample probe orientation in order to allow flexibility
              for using the system with different CVD reactor configurations and multiple
              users.    One application for the equipment will be to assist with the PI's
              current research into the reaction mechanism, kinetic parameters, and reactor
              design models for the CVD of copper thin films.  The equipment will also be
              suitable for a range of other projects, both in the PI's laboratory (e.g. TiO2
              CVD using alkoxide pyrolysis) as well as other investigators who are studying
              gas-solid reaction kinetics (e.g. methane oxidation research).
