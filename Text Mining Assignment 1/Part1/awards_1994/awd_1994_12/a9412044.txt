Abstract    :
              9412044  HELMHOLZ  This project uses quantitative methods and economic theory to
               understand how, when, and why key aspects of modern Anglo-  American criminal
              law emerged.  Modern Anglo-American criminal  law is characterized by two
              features that differ from the origins  of public legal authority: (1) public
              agents, rather than the  victim, exercise the power to prosecute; and (2)
              criminal  sanctions are punitive rather than compensatory.  The proposed 
              research explores the origins and consequences of the shift to  public
              prosecution and punitive sanctions in medieval England.      Through analysis
              of manuscript sources in Great Britain's Public  Records Office, the project
              will seek to confirm preliminary  research that suggests that this key shift
              occurred in the early  thirteenth century, nearly a century later than usually
              believed.  It will also seek evidence to document the hypothesis that the 
              shift to public prosecution and punitive sanctions was the  unintended
              consequence of a procedural change to judicial  prosecution of discontinued
              private accusations, which was  probably introduced for other reasons such as
              increasing royal  revenue.  The consequences of this shift away from a system
              based  on private incentive were primarily negative, however, including  a
              doubling in the rate of flight from justice and a decline in  the rate of
              prosecution of most crime.      The proposed research will develop important
              historical data and  contribute to our theoretical understanding of the
              development of  criminal law.  It also has implications for criminal justice 
              policy-making.  ***
