Abstract    :
              Project Summary  Nagy/ATM-9412363         This continuation of an ongoing grant
              will support ionosphere-  plasmasphere studies.  The project will explore the
              role of the  ring current as a major source of energy for the subauroral to low
               latitude ionosphere.  One focus of the program will be on the decay  of the
              ring current as a result of pitch-angle scattering and  energy diffusion and
              the associated aeronomical consequences.  In  addition, the investigators will
              continue to explore the Coulomb  interaction between the ring current and
              plasmaspheric particles .   Another important element of the proposed program
              will be an  investigation of the ionospheric response to energetic inputs from 
              the ring current and electrodynamic coupling processes in the  subauroral
              region.
