Abstract    :
              9412095  Brookhart  University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill  Dr. Maurice
              Brookhart, Chemistry Department, University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill, is
              supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
              for an investigation into the metal catalyzed olefin polymerizations and
              oligomerizations. The energetics of metal migration along alkyl chains will be
              determined, methods will be developed for the preparation of terminally
              functionalized polyethylene, and highly functionalized polyethylene will be
              prepared using previously identified cobalt catalysts. New nickel and palladium
              catalysts, based on cationic allyl complexed, and highly selective rhodium
              catalysts will be prepared for the production of functionalized polyethylene. 
              Some of the highest volume commercial polymers are obtained from the
              polymerization of olefins. Most commercial catalysts are based on metals which
              occur on the left side of the periodic chart. This study is aimed at metals in
              the middle of the chart since these metals are more compatible with a wide
              variety of  olefins which will permit the design of new catalysts for the
              improved production of plastics with a wide range of properties.
