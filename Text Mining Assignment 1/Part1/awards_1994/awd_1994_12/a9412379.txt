Abstract    :
              9412379  Saiz      After developing a statistical model to test the empirical 
              relationship between a measure of racial bias in voter turnout  and
              quantitative indicators of state public policies, this  Minority Research
              Initiation Planning Grant will afford the  Principal Investigator the
              opportunity to develop a project on  the consequences of minority participation
              in the political  process.  The investigator will look at the relationship
              between  minority voting and policy responsiveness and will test  hypotheses
              regarding rival explanations of public policy  behavior.
