Abstract    :
                                                      9412476  Riemer         This grant will
              support a study by the Commission on Physical  Sciences, Mathematics, and
              Applications' (CPSMA) Board on Physics  and Astronomy (BPA) Committee to assess
              the present status of  optical and infrared astronomy and recommend strategies
              to optimize  progress in this field within constrained support.  The study will
               be carried out by a panel under the Committee on Astronomy and  Astrophysics. 
              As part of this study, the panel will consider the  role of the National
              Optical Astronomy Observatories (NOAO) in  meeting the goals of this field. 
              Broad input from the astronomy  community will be solicited, and site visits
              will be held.  The  report will be completed by approximately January 1, 1995.
