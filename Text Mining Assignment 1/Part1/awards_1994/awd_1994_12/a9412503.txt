Abstract    :
              9412503  Ghattas  The joint research project between Carnegie Mellon  University
              and Shadyside Hospital proposes to improve our  understanding of basic
              biomechanical issues related to  cementless joint replacement surgery, resolve
              related  computational problems, and consequently lead to better  support and
              further improvement of preoperative surgical  simulation systems.  Specific
              tasks of the proposed research  are: (1) to characterize the assembly strains
              in the  proximal femur and the acetabulum, which occur with the  implantation
              of a cementless press-fit component, (2) to  optimize the shape parameters for
              implant and bone, and (3)  to develop an efficient procedure to create a
              reliable 3D  finite element model of the hip joint based on CT scan data. 
              Analytical models will be developed to describe the  mechanical performance of
              the bone/implant construct, and  subsequently the mechanical environment due to
              normal joint  loads.  The mechanical performance of the full-scale three- 
              dimensional analytical models will be compared to the  results from simplified
              analytical models and published  experimental results.  ***
