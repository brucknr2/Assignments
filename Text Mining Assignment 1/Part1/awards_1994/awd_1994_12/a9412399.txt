Abstract    :
                        9412399  Payne      Brood parasitic birds lay their eggs in the nest
              of other  species, the fosters, which rear their young; the parasite  birds do
              not rear their own young.  In the African finches,  field work suggests that
              adult parasites copy the song of  the birds that rear them, and females mate
              with males with  songs like their own foster parents.  This style of behavior 
              may have led to new races and species.  The project tests  these ideas with
              behavior experiments, field work, and  molecular genetics to compare the
              evolutionary history of  the parasites and their foster species.  In
              experiments, the  parasites will lay in aviaries in their normal fosters' 
              nest.  The eggs will be moved to a new foster species, and  the young will be
              reared by this foster.  Then the behavior  of the adult parasites will be
              tested to determine if males  sing the song of the bird that reared them, and
              females  prefer males that sing like their foster father.  The  experiment
              recreates the conditions when the parasite  switches to a new foster species,
              at the beginning of a  cultural speciation event.  This is a novel model of the
               origin of species in birds. In the field in Africa, young  parasites will be
              photographed to test how similar they are  in appearance as begging young to
              their fosters' young,  which have bright mouth colors.  Morphology and genetics
               will be tested for evidence of a past switch of foster  species in natural
              condition.  Molecular genetics of adults  and of young finches will be compared
              for the gene histories  of the species of brood parasites and their foster
              species  group, to test whether the parasites evolved along with  their old
              foster species, or switched from old to new foster  species.
