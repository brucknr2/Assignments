Abstract    :
                 This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation
              Research Program, and it is a study of  the publics and politics of theater in
              the early Soviet Union.  In the 1920s, the Soviet government sought to use
              theater as an instrument of ideological indoctrination, at the same time that
              Russian dramatists were experimenting relatively freely with a range of new
              approaches to drama that were influential around the world.  Therefore, this
              research project will contribute both to an understanding of the role of the
              arts under dictatorship and to the sociology of cultural innovation.  Primary
              data collection at archives in Moscow and St. Petersburg will greatly
              strengthen the information available from American sources about this crucially
              important phase in twentieth-century culture and political transformation.  %%%
                This research will provide insights for the rapidly growing area of sociology
              that examines the production of culture, and a deep understanding of the
              radical transformations that produced the Soviet Union will be valuable for
              comprehending the equally massive changes in the wake of its disintegration. 
              In addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this award
              will materially assist a highly promising student in completing research for
              the Ph.D. dissertation.  Thus it contributes to the future scientific manpower
              of the nation and the thorough training of the next generation of social
              scientists.
