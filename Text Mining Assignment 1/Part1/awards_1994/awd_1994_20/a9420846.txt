Abstract    :
              9420846  Billard    The American Statistical Association (ASA) requests a travel
              grant for 20 United States participants to attend the 50th Session of the
              International Statistical Institute (ISI) in Beijing, China from August 21-29,
              1995.  The ISI meeting includes the meetings of the Bernoulli Society,
              International Association for Official Statistics (IAOS), International
              Association for Statistical Computing (IASC), International Association of
              Survey Statisticians (IASS), and the International Association for Statistical
              Education (IASE).  Thus it is an umbrella meeting with sessions of interest for
              thousands of Statisticians.  The travel grant will provide partial support to
              defray transportation costs for individuals selected from institutions and
              non-profit associations.  An emphasis of the award is to encourage and provide
              the opportunity for younger statisticians to participate in the meeting.  ASA
              proposes to make twenty travel grants available, with the major emphasis on
              providing partial travel support to individuals who received their Ph.D. after
              1984.  The grant recipients will be primarily engaged in the meeting activities
              as invited speakers, discussants, organizers, and presenters of contributed
              papers.  Examples of titles of some of the papers presented in 1993 include,
              "Object Oriented Methods in Statistics - Graphical Construction and Editing of
              Plots" "The Strata of Random Mappings," "Bayesian Analysis of Space-Time
              Evolution of Earthquakes," and "Time Series Applications of Astronomy and
              Meteorology."     The American Statistical Association (ASA) requests a travel
              grant for 20 United States participants to attend the 50th Session of the

              Education (IASE).  Thus it is an umbrella meeting with sessions of interest for
