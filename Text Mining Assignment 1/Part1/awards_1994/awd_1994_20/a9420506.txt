Abstract    :
                                        ABSTRACT                                  AST-9420506 
              GREENE, Thomas    The PI proposes to purchase a set of circular variable 
              filters (CVFs) for the CSHELL spectrograph of the NASA  Infrared Telescope
              Facility (IRTF).  These will eliminate  interference fringing patterns in
              spectra, provide  additional wavelength coverage, and reject out-of-band 
              radiation from adjacent orders of the echelle grating.  These CVFs incorporate
              a wedged substrate design which has  been successfully tested on
              discrete-wavelength narrow-band  filters, but this will be the first time such
              a design has  been incorporated into a CVF.    Interference fringing of CVFs is
              a common problem which  seriously limits signal-to-noise in astronomical 
              spectrographs.  Low signal-to-noise caused by interference  patterns in CSHELL
              spectra has limited the scientific  results of many key projects.  The new
              filters should  greatly improve the signal-to-noise performance of CSHELL.  ***
