Abstract    :
              Trumbo, Stephen  IBN-9420985                        NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY       
                                        Behavioral flexibility is the key to relating
              behavior to  ecology and to reproductive success.  The research proposed  here
              will develop the first invertebrate model of a  biparental organism for
              studying the behavioral and hormonal  mechanisms that regulate reproductive
              behavior.  Blood  levels of juvenile hormone will be determined and correlated 
              with detailed changes in parental behavior.  Topical  application of juvenile
              hormone will be used to test the  hypothesis that increased male parental
              effort will increase  the rate of larval development and lead to a decrease in 
              parental effort by the male's partner.  Hormone levels will  also be measured
              during competitive interactions between two  females to test the hypothesis
              that contests for the  breeding resource result in elevated levels of juvenile 
              hormone.  Furthermore, Juvenile hormone will be administered  to subordinate
              females during competition for resources to  examine hormonal influences on
              dominance, reproductive  output and parental contributions to broods of mixed 
              parentage.  This study will be based on an already thorough  understanding of
              behavioral variation in the animals in a  natural ecological context.  The
              ability to integrate  behavioral and physiological analyses in a group amenable
              to  experimental manipulation will contribute to a broader  understanding of
              the flexibility of reproductive behavior.  The proposed project promises to
              advance our understanding  of how complex sequences of behavior are organized,
              and how  behavioral flexibility contributes to effective parental  care.
