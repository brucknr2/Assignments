Abstract    :
              9420335  Sander  A series of projects in the theory of statistical physics far
              from  equilibrium will be studied.  The growth of random rough surfaces  will
              be considered; new work is proposed in the description of  growth by
              molecular-beam epitaxy.  An inverse method will be  applied to the generic
              theory of interface growth, and the  Kuramoto-Shivashinsky equation of flame
              fronts will be investigated  using the same techniques.  Three problems related
              to the  diffusion-limited aggregation model will be studied:  the question  of
              lacunarity, a statistical analysis of the homogenieties of the  fractal
              clusters produced by the model, and the inverse method will  be applied to
              generate a continuum equation.  Finally work will be  done in the field of
              patterns and fluctuations in chemical  reactions.  In the context of two simple
              statistical models an  attempt to understand the effects of noise and disorder
              on the  formation of chemical patterns will be undertaken.  %%%  A series of
              projects will be undertaken on systems which are not in  equilibrium.  Examples
              of these systems include:  the growth of  surfaces in materials, the behavior
              of flames, models of  aggregation of particles, pattern formation occuring in
              chemical  reactions and the effects of noise on these systems.  Common models 
              which describe these various phenomena will be studied.
