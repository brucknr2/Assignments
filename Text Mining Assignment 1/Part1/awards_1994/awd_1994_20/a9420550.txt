Abstract    :
              9420550  Deluisi  There is growing concern in the scientific community and the
              public  at large regarding reports of increasing solar ultraviolet  radiation
              reaching the Earth's surface. Of particular concern is  the increase in
              biologically damaging ultraviolet-B radiation as a  consequence of
              stratospheric ozone depletion. In response to these  concerns, several U.S.
              federal agencies are conducting ultraviolet-  monitoring and research
              activities to better understand trends and  effects of ultraviolet radiation.
              These efforts are coordinated  through the development of a U.S. interagency
              ultraviolet radiation  monitoring plan. The establishment of a National
              Ultraviolet  Radiation Calibration Facility is critical to the interagency 
              efforts. The mission of the facility is to insure that the data  archived by
              networks that utilize the facility's calibration  resources will not suffer
              from disparate and ambiguous calibrations  that could compromise the validity
              of scientific conclusions  derived from the use of the data. This award
              provides funds for  equipment for the facility, which is being supported
              through the  efforts of the National Science Foundation, the Environmental 
              Protection Agency, the United States Department of Agriculture, the  National
              Institute of Standards and Technology, and the National  Oceanic and
              Atmospheric Administration.
