Abstract    :
                The objective of this research is to develop a haptic interface  system that
              allows force interactions with computer-generated  virtual reality graphical
              displays. This system is based on  coupling the human hand with a robotic
              manipulator using  electromagnetic principles. The development and interfacing
              of the  mechanical hardware used to implement the force feedback system is  a
              major aspect of the research. A six degree of freedom robot  manipulator is
              used as the motion platform for the force interface  device and to provide
              reactions for the electromagnetic forces. The  robot will hold the magnetic
              force generation device near the hand  of the user, using position and
              orientation tracking to follow the  motion of the user's hand. Virtual forces
              will be computed from the  interactions between objects and the user's hand in
              the virtual  environment and transmitted to the human by energizing electrical 
              coils attached to the finger tips of the user. Development of a  virtual
              environment for studying real-time interactions is also a  part of the
              research. Geometric models of the virtual objects will  be developed and
              displayed using a head mounted display coupled  with a Silicon Graphics, Inc.,
              Onyx Reality Engine. The position of  the user's head will provide visual
              orientation of the graphics  scene. The motion of the user's hand will be
              measured using the  relative position of the robot. Finally, strategies for
              real time  motion and collision detection of the objects in the virtual 
              environment will be developed.
