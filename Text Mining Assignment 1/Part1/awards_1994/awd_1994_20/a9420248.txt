Abstract    :
              Determining whether or not a previous event occurred represents a central use of
              memory in everyday life. This form of memory, referred to as recognition
              memory, plays an important role in a diverse range of practically-important
              behaviors, from eyewitness accounts of past events to childhood memories and
              the assessment of their validity.  A recognition memory judgment requires
              people to say whether they have or have not experienced a particular event. 
              Traditional investigations of recognition memory have emphasized the role of
              decision processes, as well as memory representations in influencing such
              recognition memory judgments.  The work proposed here attempts to uncover the
              mechanisms underlying decision processes in recognition memory using a range of
              experimental techniques and theoretical approaches.  We attempt to discover the
              factors that sytematically influence decision processes and the relation
              between these factors and observed memory performance. We hope to use these
              discoveries to construct models for measuring the validity of recognition
              memory across a range of situations.
