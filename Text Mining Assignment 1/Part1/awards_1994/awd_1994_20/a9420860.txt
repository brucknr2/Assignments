Abstract    :
              9420860  Howe  This study will examine whether seed-eating birds, and
              seed-eating and foliage-eating rodents influence community structure of
              tallgrass prairie. The objective is to determine whether predictable foraging
              behaviors have predictable consequences for composition and dominance in model
              tallgrass communities. To do so, the investigators will establish controlled
              communities of plant species stratified by seed size, form, and phenology.
              Plots protected from vertebrates should show dominance of large-seeded species
              and dicots. Plots accessible to rodents should show a depression in cover of
              seedlings of plant with seeds favored by rodents, while plots accessible to
              birds should show a depression in cover and seedlings of plant with seeds in
              their optimal handling range. Plots exposed to both will be dominated by
              species with the smallest, least desirable seeds. To refine predictions, the
              PIs will integrate censuses of vertebrate populations on and off the treatment
              plots with selectivity trials of common birds, mice, and voles on seeds or
              foliage of 12 plant species. Ranking of selectivities will determine whether
              seed preferences conform to predictions of foraging theory based on seed size
              and/or encounter rate. Rankings of seed and foliage selectivities will also
              provide specific predictions of how key animal species are likely to influence
              plant communities in the field. Concordant evaluation of on-site and off-site
              vertebrate populations will permit assessment of influences of treatments as
              compared with off-site effects of birds and mammals.
