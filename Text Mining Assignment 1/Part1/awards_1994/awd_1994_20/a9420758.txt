Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic  Chemistry Program
              supports research on sonochemistry by Dr.  Kenneth S. Suslick of the Department
              of Chemistry, University of  Illinois at Champaign-Urbana.  Sonochemistry
              concerns the nature  and application of ultrasound to chemical reactions. 
              Areas of  investigation in this research project include: (1) mechanistic  and
              spectroscopic probes of the cavitation event; (2) homogeneous  sonochemistry;
              (3) heterogeneous sonochemistry and the effect of  ultrasound on solids and
              surfaces; and (4) novel materials  synthesis, both inorganic and biological. 
              Sonoluminescence  studies in both homogeneous liquids and in slurries will be
              used  to further understanding of conditions during cavitation.   Activation by
              ultrasound will extend from organic liquids and  organometallic to metal and
              non-metal surfaces, and heterogenous  catalytic systems.  Ultrasound will also
              be used for synthesis of  novel inorganic nanoscale materials and protein
              microspheres,  including those which might have enzymatic activity or have 
              potential application as MRI agents or blood substitutes.    In recent years,
              the chemical effects of ultrasound have been  studied and found to be due to
              acoustic cavitation, that is, the  formation and collapse of bubbles in a
              liquid causing intense  local heating and high pressures.  Fundamental
              understanding of  the phenomenon will continue to be explored, as well as new 
              applications of ultrasound.  Some of these include its  use for  synthesis of
              small particles of materials and proteins, which may  have industrial and
              medical applications.  Catalytic reactions  and synthesis of alloys will also
              be explored.
