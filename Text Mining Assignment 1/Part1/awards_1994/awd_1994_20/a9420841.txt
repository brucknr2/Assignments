Abstract    :
              9420841  Parpia    A Symposium on quantum fluids and solids will be held in
              Ithaca on  June 12 - 17, 1995, on the campus of Cornell University.  
              Instrumentation for physics at low temperatures together with the  results
              achieved by the application of these techniques will be  emphasized.  Attempts
              will be made to integrate the interests of  the quantum fluids and solids
              community with those of physicists in  diverse fields.    % % %    A symposium
              on the properties of solids and liquids at low  temperature will be held in
              Ithaca on June 12 - 17, 1995 on the  campus of Cornell University.  The
              symposium will emphasize the  techniques and technology of low temperature
              physics together with  the results achieved by the application of these
              techniques.   Scientists with established research programs in diverse areas
              such  as gravitational antennas, detectors (gravitational, microwave, 
              infrared), micromechanical devices, and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance  Imaging
              will be invited.  ***
