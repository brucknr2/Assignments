Abstract    :
              This award is for support for a three year program to investigate  the response
              of ice domes, such as Siple Dome in West Antarctica,  to changing boundary
              conditions, for example as arising from  fluctuations in thickness or position
              of bounding ice streams.  A  range of models will be used, from simple
              one-dimensional  analytical models to coupled dynamic-thermodynamic flow
              models,  to investigate the response of the ice dome to boundary forcing,  and
              the record that boundary forcing can leave in the ice core  record.  Using
              radar, temperature, and ice core data from the  currently funded field programs
              on Siple Dome, and ice flux and  thickness values from the map view model as
              boundary conditions,  a flow line across Siple Dome will be studied and
              possible ranges  of time scales, the likely origin of ice near the bed, and the
               basal temperature conditions that exist now and existed in the  past will be
              determined.The response of internal stratigraphy  patterns to climate and
              dynamic forcing effects will be  investigated and observed internal layers from
              ice cores will be  used to infer the forcing history.
