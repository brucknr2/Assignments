Abstract    :
              This project is developing techniques and tools for synthesizing 
              three-dimensional layouts of electromechanical systems.  Research  in this
              project is exploring new combinatorial algorithms for the  arrangement of
              mechanical components that will satisfy a large  number of conflicting design
              constraints, including volume, shape,  weight, thermal interactions, structural
              support, and accessibility  for repair.  These algorithms are being
              incorporated into tools for  the design of wearable computers, to be fabricated
              under the  auspices of other NSF-supported research at Carnegie Mellon 
              University.  To improve the educational aspects of this project and  the
              connection to the realities of product design, each graduate  student on the
              project will work as a summer intern for industrial  supporters of the project
              in the thermal analysis and project  layout groups.
