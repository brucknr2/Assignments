Abstract    :
              Abstract    AST-9420759  Schramm, David N.    Dr. Schramm will continue to lead
              a research effort with a center of activity that connects particle physics,
              nuclear physics, cosmology, and astrophysics.  Topics of interest include:
              nucleosynthesis from the big bang; the formation of galaxies and large scale
              structure and their interrelationship with dark matter; ultra-high energy
              cosmic rays; and the evolution of galaxies and globular clusters.    ***
