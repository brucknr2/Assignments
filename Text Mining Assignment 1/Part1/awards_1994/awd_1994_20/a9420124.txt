Abstract    :
              9420124  Pierce  Plants accumulate phytoalexins as one of several active- 
              defense mechanisms.  These infection-induced, low molecular  weight,
              antimicrobial compounds have been shown in several  host/pathogen systems to
              accumulate in planta to  concentrations sufficient to account for pathogen 
              inhibition, judging from in vitro bioassays.  The question  remains whether
              they are essential for resistance.  If  plants rely on phytoalexins for a
              significant fraction of  their resistance, then genes controlling phytoalexin 
              synthesis are worthy targets for genetic manipulation with  potential for crop
              improvement.  This project will test the  necessity of phytoalexins for
              resistance to bacterial blight  in cotton by producing transgenic plants with
              altered  ability to accumulate phytoalexins and evaluating their  resistance
              following inoculation with Xanthomonas campestris  pv. malvacearum.  By
              manipulating phytoalexin accumulation  apart from other aspects of the
              hypersensitive resistant  response, the project will provide a clearer
              understanding  of how plants need to react in order to successfully fight 
              disease.
