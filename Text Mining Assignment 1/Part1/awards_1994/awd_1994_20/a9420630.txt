Abstract    :
              9420630  Salama    Description:  This project supports  participation by a U.S.
              scientific delegation  to a conference/workshop on "Statistics and  Quality of
              Life: A Third World Perspective" to  be held in Hurgada, Egypt, December 14-16,
               1994.  The topics to be covered include:  medical studies and clinical trials;
               epidemiological studies; environmental studies;  genetics and biotechnology;
              and population  studies".  The emphasis will be on the  relevance of
              statistical methodology in the  scientific investigations in these areas.  
              particular attention will be paid to the  prospective and retrospective picture
              relevant  to third world countries along with their vast  cultural and ethnic
              diversities.  Tutorial  presentations by international authorities, as  well as
              contributed papers, will be included.   A conference volume will be published
              for  international distribution.     Scope:  This project will enable six U.S. 
              scientists to participate in this important  meeting and to interact with
              scientists from  Egypt and other countries in the region in a  field where
              advanced mathematical and  statistical tools may be applied to real-life 
              problems of concern to these countries, and  consequently, to other developed
              countries.   The meeting is organized and supported in Egypt  by Dr. A.E.
              Sarhan, President of the Egyptian  Statistical Society, and professor ,
              Institute  of Statistics, Cairo University.  The published  proceedings will
              serve as a reference for  future use by students and researchers.  It is 
              expected that contacts will lead to increased  interest in collaborative
              research by U.S. and  Egyptian scientists.  ***
