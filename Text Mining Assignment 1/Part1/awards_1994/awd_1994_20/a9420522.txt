Abstract    :
              9420522  Rix    ABSTRACT     This proposal describes a plan to develop and
              implement an undergraduate civil engineering curriculum track based on the
              following concepts:    {SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 13 \h} Focus on Assessment,
              Rehabilitation, and Reconstruction Issues: Assessing the rehabilitation and
              repair needs of older facilities requires different knowledge and problem
              solving skills than those needed for new construction.    {SYMBOL 183 \f
              "Symbol" \s 13 \h} Include Input from the Public and Private Sectors: Engineers
              must be trained to understand and accommodate the economic and political
              aspects of public works projects in addition to the technical aspects.  The
              curriculum development effort includes support from the Construction Industry
              Institute and the City of Atlanta to incorporate these views.    {SYMBOL 183 \f
              "Symbol" \s 13 \h} Develop a Sustainable Combined Research and Curriculum
              Development Program:  A framework will be created and implemented that provides
              formal mechanisms for continually integrating research and public/private
              sector issues into an undergraduate curriculum track on infrastructure
              assessment, rehabilitation, and reconstruction.    {SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s
              13 \h} Capitalize on Cognitive Science and Educational Technologies:  The
              proposed curriculum utilizes innovative dissemination techniques and
              incorporates research on engineering learning and pedagogical methods.  ***
