Abstract    :
              9420853      ABSTRACT         This proposal seeks to use experiment and modeling
              of transient flow instabilities in fully condensing two-parallel-tube heat
              transfer systems as a first step in understanding these instabilities in more
              complex systems.  Existing experimental equipment will be used to measure these
              instabilities, and a model based on the behavior of a single equivalent tube
              will be used to correlate the behavior of the two-tube system. The work seeks
              to provide insight into the complex behavior of unstable flow systems, and may
              have important applications in large-scale equipment such as power plant and
              chemical process industry condensers where such behavior occurs.
