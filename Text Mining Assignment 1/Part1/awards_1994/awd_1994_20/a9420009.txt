Abstract    :
              9420009  HOLZENTHAL  Funds from this award will be used to support the travel of
              international participants at the 8th International Symposium on Trichoptera
              (caddisflies), which will be held at the University of Minnesota and Lake
              Itasca, MN during July 1995.  These meetings, where scientists can share their
              most recent research results through formal and informal discussions, take
              place every three years. This is only the second time one of these symposia has
              been held in the Western Hemisphere.  Special attention will be placed on
              identifying and inviting caddisfly biologists from Latin America to the
              symposium and on sponsoring those international participants who might
              otherwise be unable to attend the symposium because of financial limitations. 
              About 100 scientists from around the world are expected to participate and they
              will present papers on all aspects of caddisfly biology, including ecology,
              taxonomy, biogeography, pollution tolerance, physiology, evolution, and
              behavior among other topics.  Publication of symposium proceedings are planned.
               %%%  Caddisflies, or Trichoptera, are a group of aquatic insects that are best
              known for the cases and nets constructed by their immature stages.  Caddisflies
              are very important participants in aquatic food webs, where their larvae serve
              as food for fish and in turn feed on other smaller aquatic organisms or stream
              debris.  Caddisfly larvae are found around the world and occupy many different
              microhabitats.  They are also very sensitive to pollution and are used as
              biological indicators of water quality.  ***
