Abstract    :
              9420077  Bellamy       A joint conference on topology and dynamical systems will
              be  held at the University of Delaware, Newark, Delaware, from March 30  to
              April 2, 1995.  This is one of a series of annual conferences  dating back to
              1967 (for the topology part), and well over 200  mathematicians are expected to
              attend.  Over the years this  conference has managed to maintain its
              traditional identity and at  the same time to expand its breadth.  In
              particular, dynamical  systems was integrated into the conference in 1987 and
              has since  become one of the central topics, with those aspects of the subject 
              that have strong links to the more traditional areas of the  conference having
              been emphasized.       There will be seven major one-hour addresses and
              twenty-one  invited half-hour talks.  There will be three additional concurrent
               sessions of aproximately twenty-eight fifteen-minute contributed  talks, and
              students will be encouraged to participate.  Major  addresses will be given by
              Hames A. Yorke (U Maryland), John W.  Milnor (SUNY at Stony Brook), James T.
              Rogers (Tulane U), Mary  Ellen Rudin (U Wisconsin), John H. Hubbard (Cornell
              U), Mladen  Bestvina (U of Utah), and Ruth M. Charney (Ohio State U).  ***
