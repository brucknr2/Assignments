Abstract    :
                In this proposal we request funding for a Perkin-Elmer / Applied  Biosystems
              Automated Sequencer model 373A-01 . This machine will be  used primarily by a
              group of four labs and will be also open to other  users in the Department of
              Plant Biology and the Department of  Environmental Science, Policy, and
              Management. Prior experience with a  loaned machine demonstrates that we will
              make efficient use of it.  Space, support staff, and collective resources are
              available for  permanent housing and maintenance of the machine. There is
              currently no  core sequencing facility on the Berkeley campus. This machine
              would  double the number of permanent machines on campus and would be the only 
              one available to members of either department .        Access to borrowed
              automated sequencer has accelerated the rate at  which we conduct our current
              NSF sponsored work and has also  facilitated innovations of new approaches or
              expansions of prior  expectations in the fields of microbial ecology,
              population genetics,  plant development, and plant disease resistance. It is
              clear that  automated sequencing will soon be the method of choice for labs
              such as  ours in which sequence acquisition is a rate limiting step, and as
              such  it is also the method that graduate students and postdoctoral  associates
              should learn.
