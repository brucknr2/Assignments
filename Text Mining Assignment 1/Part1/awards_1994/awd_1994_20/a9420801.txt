Abstract    :
              9420801    An Italy-U.S. Symposium in Social Psychology will be held in
              Bertinoro, Italy from May 28 - June 4, 1995.  The conference will include 15
              Italian and 15 U.S. Social Psychologists drawn from the most active and
              productive researchers in the field and covering the majority of research
              topics currently investigated. The goal of the conference is to bring together
              two research communities that have had little contact despite considerable
              domains of mutual interest and to foster cross-fertilization of research ideas
              in these domains, which include: the social psychology of culture; social
              influence; social development; intra- and intergroup relations; social
              cognition; communication and language.  This goal will be accomplished through
              a series of workshops, each of which will be jointly led by an Italian and a
              U.S. expert in that field, who will collaborate in advance to plan the
              workshop.  Other participants in each workshop will prepare posters summarizing
              their research in the area in order to ensure maximal involvement by all
              participants.
