Abstract    :
              9420465  Ballance  A Symposium on the chemical perspectives of microelectronic 
              materials is being held to address current topics in the chemistry  of
              synthesis, processing and use of semiconductors, dielectrics and  metals in a
              wide variety of potential areas in the field of  electronics/photonics with a
              strong emphasis on fundamental atomic  level processes.  Particular focus will
              be on chemical issues  associated with the rapidly expanding and
              technologically relevant  areas of nanotechnology and chemical sensors. 
              Additionally there  will be an opportunity to assess the field, and to
              establish ties  between universities, research institutions, and industry.  It
              is  expected that top scientists in the field will attend, and that the 
              Symposium will provide an effective forum to discuss and delineate  the
              critical scientific issues in this research area, and to  consider and define
              the approaches and techniques needed to address  them.  %%%  An evaluation of
              the status of chemical aspects and perspectives of  microelectronic materials,
              and especially the critical chemical  issues in nanoscale technology, and
              recommendations by the  Symposium participants for the emphasis of future work,
              and their  assessment of the most important contemporary research issues will 
              be of great value to the understanding and enhanced utilization of  chemical
              methodology in the field of microelectronics.
