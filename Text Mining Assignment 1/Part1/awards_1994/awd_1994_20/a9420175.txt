Abstract    :
              9420175  Bradshaw  This research will focus on characterizing ammonia's (NH3)
              impact  on the tropospheric chemistry within the remote marine atmosphere 
              through the quantitative measurement of gas phase NH3, "total" NH3  (i.e.
              gaseous plus particulate), and nitric oxide (NO) on board the  NSF/NCAR C-130
              aircraft during the 1995 Southern Hemisphere Marine  Aerosol Characterization
              Experiment (ACE-1).  This effort will seek  to address NH3's role within the
              primary ACE-1 program objective of  determining the key physical and chemical
              processes controlling the  formation and fate of aerosols and how these
              processes affect the  number size distribution, the chemical composition, and
              the optical  and cloud nucleating properties of these particles.  For a few 
              parts-per-trillion levels of NH3 that are anticipated over the ACE-  1 study
              regions, the Georgia Tech advanced photofragmentation  laser-induced
              fluorescence (PF/LIF) sensor will be used to acquire  high precision ( 10%, 2s)
              data with sufficient spatial resolution  to enable a detailed characterization
              of the small spatial scale  atmospheric inhomogeneities that are thought to
              give rise to bursts  in condensation nuclei (CN) production.  These
              unprecedented  measurement capabilities will produce data capable of yielding
              new  insights into NH3's role in controlling the development of CN and  the
              growth and activation of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN).  In  conjunction with
              other ACE-1 measurements, this project should  provide a unique perspective of
              the relative contributions that  binary and ternary nucleation processes make
              toward controlling the  rate of new particle production in the remote
              atmosphere.  This  investigation will also provide the atmospheric community
              with  needed information of the spatial distribution of NH3 within the 
              troposphere over remote marine environments.  This large spatial  scale survey
              will also provide the basis for the first quantitative  assessment of NH3's
              role as possible source of nitrogen oxides  (N0x) i n the remote troposphere.
