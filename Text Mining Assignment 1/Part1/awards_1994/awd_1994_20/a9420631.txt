Abstract    :
              9420631  Weinberg  An   investigation  will  be  performed  of  two   important 
              anomalies  regarding the crystallization of sol-gel  derived  materials.  These
              are; the observed crystallization of  some  powders  and bulk materials at
              temperatures well  below  the  usual  glass  transition temperature, and  the 
              tendency  of  certain sol-gel thin films to crystallize well in excess  of  the
               powder  (or  bulk) crystallization kinetics  of  highly  porous,  large
              surface area sol gel materials  in  order  to  shed light on these anaomalies. 
              %%%  Experimental studies of the crystallization behavior of gels  in bulk and
              film form as a function of preparation procedure  and substrate type will be
              done and theoretical modeling  of  the crystallization kinetics will be tested.
