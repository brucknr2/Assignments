Abstract    :
              At the heart of a renaissance in the science programs of  Dquesne University is
              a talented and enthusiastic cadre of  faculty carrying out innovative research
              in their various  fields.  This proposal requests funding towards the purchase 
              of three pieces of equipment viz: a scintillation counter,  an automated DNA
              sequencer, and a high speed centrifuge.  Each piece of equipment will be
              regularly used by several  members of our faculty.  Thus, their availability
              will  greatly enhance the research productivity of the PI, co-PIs,  and other
              faculty members.  The quality of our graduate and  undergraduate programs will
              also be enhanced by the  availability of these pieces of equipment.
