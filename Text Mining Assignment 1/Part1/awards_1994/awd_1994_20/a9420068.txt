Abstract    :
                The technique of thermophoretic sampling coupled with electron microscopy,  as
              developed by the PI, has been extensively used in steady flames to help
              elucidate the mechanisms of soot growth and oxidation.  The objective of this
              proposed research is to demonstrate that the technique of thermophoretic
              sampling can be applied to forced flickering flames.  Because of the time
              varying nature of flickering flames, application of the thermophoretic sampling
              technique takes on a degree of high risk, making this proposal an ideal
              candidate for the SGER program.  The PI hopes to optimize both the forcing
              frequency and probing time so that meaningful soot samples can be collected
              from these forced flickering flames.  If this indeed can be shown to be the
              case, the resolution to the question of why flickering flames appear to form
              significantly greater quantities of soot as compared to similar steady flames
              should be closer to a solution.  This could be significant in the understanding
              of soot formation in turbulent combustion since flickering flames are viewed to
              bridge the gap between laminar and turbulent flames.
