Abstract    :
              9420481  Warr    This three-year award will support U.S.-Sweden-Estonia
              cooperative  research in immunology.  The investigators are Gregory Warr of the
               Medical University of South Carolina, Lars Pilstrom of Uppsala  University in
              Sweden, and Sirje Timmusk of the Estonian Marine  Institute.  The objective of
              their research is the study of antibody gene  expression in transgenic rainbow
              trout.  They propose single cell  studies of the following:   (1) channel
              catfish immunoglobulin  enhancer in tissue-specific gene expression in rainbow
              trout; (2)  impact of transgenic expression of the endogenous immunoglobulin 
              genes of rainbow trout; and (3) functional chimeric antibodies in  transgenic
              rainbow trout.    The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration expertise
              with in  vitro studies of gene expression and catfish immunoglobulin genes  and
              enhancers.  This is complemented by the Swedish and Estonian  investigators'
              experience in growing transgenic trout and expertise  with in vivo transgenic
              studies of immunoglobulin expression. The  transgenic fish are grown and
              maintained at the Estonian Marine  Institute.  The project will determine
              whether the catfish heavy chain  gene can be expressed and if so can it assist
              with the formation of a  functional antibody in rainbow trout.  The project
              will advance our  understanding of the immune system and comparative
              immunology.  It also has potentially important commercial applications if
              transgenic  fish with desired traits can be raised.  ***
