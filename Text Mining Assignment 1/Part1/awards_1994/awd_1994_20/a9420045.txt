Abstract    :
              ATM-9420045                                                        The Principal
              Investigator and his research staff will  continue their research on the
              analysis and numerical simulation   of convective storms and associated severe
              weather phenomena. The  research is aimed at furthering understanding of the
              processes  involved in the transformation of thunderstorms to mesoscale 
              convective systems (MCSs) and the quantification of the role of  potential
              vorticity on the genesis and evolution of MCSs.  The  researchers also will
              investigate the physical factors responsible  for the formation and maintenance
              of severe straight line winds and  tornadoes.          The research combines
              the use of an interactive, nested-grid  model, viz. Colorado State University s
              (CSU) Regional Atmospheric  Modeling System (RAMS) with analysis of data
              gathered by high-  resolution observational systems, including the CSU-CHILL
              radar, a  national research facility. The linkage between modeling and 
              observations provides iterative testing of hypotheses by numerical 
              simulations, validation and refinement mf the models and  objectively analyzed
              documentation of storms. An additional  important element of the planned work
              lies in new developments in  the RAMS' physics and numerics.   ***
