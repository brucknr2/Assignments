Abstract    :
              9420557  Verber    ABSTRACT       The development of a senior-level fiber-optic
              communication laboratory sequence is proposed.  The content of the laboratories
              incorporates experience gained through the research activities of several
              members of the faculty of the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering
              (ECE) at Georgia Tech.  This laboratory sequence comprises the final two
              courses of a four-course Area of Specialization (AoS) in Optical
              Communications.     The proposed laboratory sequence has a number of novel
              features including a pipelined approach in which groups of students design a
              system component, evaluate the designs of the preceding class, and fabricate
              the evaluated design of the class before that.  This not only gives the
              students experience in the important areas of design, evaluation, and
              implementation.  It is intended that over time, a complete working optical
              network will evolve which an then be used as a test bed for the implementation
              of applications designed by later groups of students.     In the near term, the
              Design Laboratory will be coupled to on-going research by the introduction of
              devices such as Er-doped fiber amplifiers, electro-optic modulators, and WDM
              components which are being used in current research programs.  In later years,
              system and application concepts developed in the research programs of the
              Computer Engineering and the Computer Science Faculties will be introduced in a
              way which will enhance the relevance of the courses to current and future
              practice in fiber optic communications.  ***
