Abstract    :
              9420286  Murdoch    This research will develop theory for the population
              dynamics of insect host-parasitoid interactions for species with continuous
              reproduction and development.  It will concentrate on mechanisms that depend on
              either the host developmental stage that is attacked (stage-structured
              processes) or the physiological state of the searching parasitoid
              (state-dependent processes), or on both.  Only recently have modeling
              techniques advanced to the point that these types of mechanisms can be
              realistically incorporated into population dynamic models.  The goals of the
              research are (1) to get insight into the dynamical effects of processes seen in
              stage-structured parasitoid-host systems, (2) to obtain generality by showing
              how apparently different mechanisms have similar dynamical consequences, (3) to
              incorporate into population dynamics recent evolutionary ideas about optimal
              parasitoid behavior, and (4) to explain observed dynamical patterns and alert
              us to potential new patterns.    About 10% of all metazoan species are
              parasitoids.  They are important in many natural communities and have been used
              in agriculture over the past 100 years as environmentally safe, and frequently
              highly effective, agents for controlling insect pests.  The results will give
              insight into the processes and mechanisms driving the dynamics of such
              parasitoid-host systems.  In addition, they will bring together population
              dynamics and recent ideas on, and insights into, the evolutionary basis for
              parasitoid behavior.
