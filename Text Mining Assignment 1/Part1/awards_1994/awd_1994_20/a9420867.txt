Abstract    :
              9420867  Calaprice  The development of a new detector for live-time measurements
              of  low energy solar neutrinos is proposed.  To achieve the required  low
              background conditions, the detector must be located  underground and be made of
              materials of natural radiopurity.  It  consists of a large ultra pure liquid
              scintillator operation in  the Gran Sasso underground laboratory in Italy.  The
              required  purity levels are unprecedented and much of the effort of this 
              proposal will be to develop special detector materials by  powerful
              purification methods.  This detector will be the first  of its kind and will be
              the lowest background detector in the  world.  The scintillator detector
              proposed here, which has become  known as the Borexino experiment, is designed
              to detect the 7Be  neutrino in live mode.  The expected count rate in the 100
              ton  fiducial volume is about 50 per day.  The essential requirement  of this
              experiment is a large unsegmented detector with uranium  and thorium
              radiopurities of better than 0.5fg/g.  A prototype  detector with mass of a
              4tons is currently under construction to  test the purity of the scintillator
              an other technic aspects of  the design, the initial research effort is to
              complete the  development of the scintillator vessel and the scintillator 
              purification system an to install these in the prototype  detector.  The second
              major effort will be to employ the test  facility to study the effectiveness of
              purification processes.  The researcher will then design the full scale
              Borexino  experiment.  ***
