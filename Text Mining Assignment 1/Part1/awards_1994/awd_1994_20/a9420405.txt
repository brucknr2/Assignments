Abstract    :
              9420405  Mistree       This grant provides funding for research and development
              of a   Virtual Prototyping environment for use throughout product design   for
              assessing a product's serviceability and demanufacturability.    Design for
              service and demanufacture (i.e., the entire process   involved in recycling,
              reuse, and/or disposal of a product after it   has been taken back by a
              company) lends itself to Virtual   Prototyping because of the expense involved
              in creating hardware   prototypes to be tested for service and demanufacture. 
              The   specific research thrusts in this project are product  representation 
              and model generation, human-in-the-loop simulation,  demanufacturing  process
              simulation, and decision support.  The  overall objectives  are to improve the
              quality of the  decision-making process during  product design and to obtain
              the  resulting product in a reduced  amount of time.  The target  application
              is the service and  demanufacture of automobiles.       This work will result
              in a prototypical virtual design,   service, and demanufacture studio.  The
              underlying product   representation and design information generated during
              virtual   prototyping coupled with the decision-making process enables a  
              better informed and more rational decision-making process.  The   virtual
              design, service, and demanufacture virtual prototyping   environment will be
              used in courseware for enhancing   environmentally conscious product design
              education.
