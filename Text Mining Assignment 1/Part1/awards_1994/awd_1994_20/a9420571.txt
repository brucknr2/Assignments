Abstract    :
              9420571  Babu    ABSTRACT     The goal of this proposal is to assist in the
              presentation, evaluation and dissemination of these underlying principles to
              undergraduate engineering students utilizing menu-driven, easily accessible,
              self-contained, interactive learning modules delivered in the CD-ROM format. 
              Our task will be to cover a broad range of film structures, methods of
              deposition, and characterization techniques emphasizing our expertise and
              involving the student in as much experimental contact as possible.  Our
              collective expertise also includes graphic simulation of film growth and thin
              film device performance as well as multimedia production and courseware
              development.  The CD-ROM software will include a large number of progressively
              complex example case studies.  Simulation is a powerful and visually appealing
              educational tool that can easily lend itself, using the still evolving
              multi-media format, to intensive exploration of many what-if scenarios
              concerning the theory, design and operation of these reactors as well as film
              and device configurations.  Combining the study of the associated experimental
              techniques with that of computer simulations using transparent interfacing can
              sustain the interest of the user even over difficult-to-learn segments of the
              proposed modules.  ***
