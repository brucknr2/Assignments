Abstract    :
              9420470  McKeown  Research will be carried out in high energy electron
              scattering  with the foals of determining the spin and flavor structure of 
              nucleons, observing manifestations of quark degrees of freedom in  quasielastic
              scattering from nuclei, and testing the hypothesis  of color transparency in
              nuclear reactions.  Additional  experiments will be carried out with high
              energy photons and high  energy protons to study the onset and manifestation of
              quark  degree of freedom, and the up- down-antiquark distribution in the 
              nucleon.  Low energy studies will be carried out with beams of  light ion to
              study reactions of importance in understanding  stellar burning of helium,
              big-bang nucleosynthesis, and the so-  called solar neutrino deficit problem. 
              Theoretical studies will  be carried out in support of these experiments and in
              other  forefront areas including: Monte-Carlo shell model calculations,  fusion
              reactions, pion interferometry, and coherent- and squeezed-  state pion
              emission.  Education of graduate students and postdocs  is a strong component
              in every aspect of this umbrella grant to  operate the Caltech Kellogg
              Laboratory.  ***
