Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    9420149  HUMPHREYS, Roberta    The Automated Plate Scanner (APS) of
              the University of Minnesota has been used to scan the glass duplicates of the
              first epoch Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS I) and create an on-line
              catalog, STARBASE, available to the public over the Internet. The database of
              hundreds of millions of stars and several million galaxies includes positions,
              magnitudes, colors, and object classification using a neural network technique.
              Another survey made at Palomar 20 years later is being scanned and measured for
              proper motions of every object possible in the POSS I database. Duplicates of
              the second epoch Palomar Sky Survey (POSS II) plates are to be obtained and
              measured. The resulting databases from the additional surveys will be made
              available over the Internet in a user-friendly form. The new databases will
              include some image information, as well.
