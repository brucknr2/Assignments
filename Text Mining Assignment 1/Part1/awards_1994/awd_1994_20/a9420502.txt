Abstract    :
              #9420502   Rauscher   This proposal seeks funding for the sixth Gordon
              Conference on the Chemistry of Plant-Herbivore Interactions to be held in
              January 1995 in Oxnard, California. The focus of this conference will be a
              critical assessment of the directions in which the study of Plant-Herbivore
              Interactions is heading, as well as identification of the crucial outstanding
              problems in this subdiscipline. In addition, a major goal of this conference
              will be to determine if and how plant-herbivore systems can contribute to
              conceptual generalizations in larger disciplines such as chemistry, behavior,
              physiology and ecology. The conference program is designed to facilitate
              discussion of several specific topics: 1) Is there a coherent, general
              conceptual framework for understanding chemical interactions between plants and
              herbivores? Is attempting to construct such a framework desirable? 2) Are there
              general principles that cut across taxa and environments and apply to many, if
              not most, plant-herbivore systems? Or must each system be studied as a special
              case? 3) What are the important unresolved conceptual issues and unsolved
              problems that need to be addressed in this field? 4) How can the study of
              plant-herbivore systems contribute to conceptual advancement of major
              disciplines such as chemistry, physiology, behavior, ecology, and evolution?  
              %%%   The timing of this conference is ideal. The study of plant-herbivore
              interactions is now in a stage where vast amounts of data have been collected
              and it is now time to step back and synthesize. This subdiscipline has
              important contributions to make on management of crop systems which annually
              suffer huge economic losses to pests. Clearer understanding of the chemical
              underpinnings of the discipline can lead to more ecological forms of pest
              management
