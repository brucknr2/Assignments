Abstract    :
                  This proposal represents a request that the National Science  Foundation
              help to sponsor a symposium entitled "Mechanisms of  oocyte maturation and
              fertilization" organized for the Seventh  International Congress of
              Invertebrate Reproduction and  Development, to be held August 6th-11th, 1995 in
              Santa Cruz, CA.   The symposium considers hormonal and sperm interaction with
              the egg  membrane in invertebrate systems: sea urchins, abalone, etc.   While
              many advances have occuried regarding the molecules that  initiate oocyte
              maturation, the receptor mechanisms and initial  mediating steps are still
              controversial.  The applicant makes the  case that the time is right for
              various workers in the field of  research to come together to discuss recent
              progress.  Travel  expenses are requested.   Many of the invited speakers are
              foreign,  and their acceptance is contingent upon at least partial funding of 
              their expenses. Results of the Congress are published as full  length, refereed
              articles in the journal Invertebrate Reproduction  and Development.   ***
