Abstract    :
                  9420620  Berridge    A region at the top of the brainstem known as the locus
               coeruleus sends nerve cell processes to a number of  locations throughout the
              forebrain and is believed to  modulate behavioral and cognitive functions.  It
              is already  known the locus coeruleus cells change their rate of  electrical
              signaling during different behavioral states, and  it has been presumed that as
              the cells change their  electrical activity they change the amount of the brain
               chemical norepinephrine which the secrete onto forebrain  sites.  Dr.
              Berridge's group will test the exact  relationship between state-dependent
              changes in locus  coeruleus electrical activity and norepinephrine secretion. 
              This work will provide new insights into the mechanisms  controlling the
              release of norepinephrine and should  therefore provide a better understanding
              of the natural  processes that modulate functions such as learning and  memory,
              and reactions to stress.  ***
