Abstract    :
              9420378  Kim   This award is to develop a virtual rapid prototyping system for
              piezoelectric micro systems (PMS).  This is an area of Micro Electromechanical
              Systems (MEMS), where actuator or sensor devices are built to the scale of a
              human hair.  PMS's move and either are driven by or produce electrical signals.
               Some examples are microphones, pumps, or motors.  The rapid prototyping system
              that will be developed used computer simulation to design the PMS devices,
              design the special processes to make them, and do performance tests on the
              virtual prototype.  As part of the program this interdisciplinary team will
              build these devices using this system and compare their virtual system
              predictions with experimental data.   The technological impact of this virtual
              rapid prototyping system will be reduced cost and lead time by providing the
              engineering tools to design both the PMS  devices and the processes to make
              them.  This means new competitive PMS-based products can be designed for
              commercial and industrial applications.  This award will also build the
              research and human resource infrastructure to be competitive in this area of
              technology.
