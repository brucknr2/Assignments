Abstract    :
              9420884  Woo  This award provides partial support for a group of 14 young  U.S.
              investigators to the subject conference that is set for  May 21-27, 1995 in
              Taiyuan, China.  Each of the  investigators is to present a paper on the
              results of his or  her research.  Benefits to U.S. participants in the 
              conference include the opportunity to develop collaborative  research projects
              with investigators in other countries, to  identify the best potential foreign
              applicants for  biomechanics graduate studies in the U.S., and to strengthen 
              ties between the other countries and the U.S.  ***
