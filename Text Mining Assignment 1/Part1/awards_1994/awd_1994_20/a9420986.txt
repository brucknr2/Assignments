Abstract    :
              9420986  Dyer     There is circumstantial evidence that plants absorb certain
              compounds secreted by herbivores (e.g.,in saliva) and use these as cues for
              initiation of compensatory growth or induced defenses.  If this view is
              correct, it has important implication for understanding the dynamics of plant
              animal interactions.  However, to date there is no convincing direct evidence
              that this is occurring.  This project is establishing definitively whether
              carbon-based compounds secreted by insect herbivores enter plant tissues during
              or after herbivory.  This project utilizes the Lawrence Livermore National
              Lab's accelerator mass spectrometry to estimate the carbon mass from herbivore
              regurgitates entering 14C-depleted experimental plants.    This research will
              improve our understanding of the dynamics of plant-herbivore interactions.  The
              results will have potential application to pest control in agriculture and
              forestry.
