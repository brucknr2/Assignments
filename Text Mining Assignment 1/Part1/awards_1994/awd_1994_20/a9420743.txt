Abstract    :
              9420743  Gindikin    This U.S.-Brazil Cooperative Science Program award supports
              travel expenses  related to the visits of Drs. S. Gindikin and J.-F. Treves,
              Rutgers University, to Sao  Paulo, Brazil.  The purpose of the visits is to
              perform research on Hyperfunctions  in Hypo-Analytic Structures. The Brazilian
              counterpart in this research   is  Dr. Paulo Cordaro, from the University of
              Sao Paulo,  Brazil.    The joint work of Cordaro and Treves has led them to a 
              formulation of   hyperfunction  theory, especially well suited for the
              application to Lie groups  representations which were suggested by Gindikin. 
              Cooperative research should be  extended to cover these new applications, and
              include Gindikin.  Visits of Gindikin  to Brazil can  cement the collaboration
              between him and Cordaro, and possibly lead   to joint work between Gindikin and
              other Brazilian mathematicians.    ***
