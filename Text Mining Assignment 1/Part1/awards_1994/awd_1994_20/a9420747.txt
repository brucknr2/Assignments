Abstract    :
              9420747  Whitten    This awards supports the participation of ten  U.S.
              scientists in a U.S.-Japan Seminar on the  Future Prospects of Solar Energy
              Conversions,  to be held January 5-9, 1995 in Kona, Hawaii.   The co-organizers
              are Professor David Whitten,  University of Rochester, and Professor Haruo 
              Inoue of Tokyo Metropolitan University.  The  seminar will be held under the
              auspices of the  U.S.-Japan Program on Photosynthesis/   Photoconversion.   
              The seminar will focus on molecular based  strategies for energy conversion and
              storage,  particularly biological systems, inorganic  systems, polymer systems,
              polychromophoric  organic compounds, and supra molecular  assemblies.  It is
              part of a series of U.S.-  Japan meetings held during the past dozen year  on
              subjects in the field of photosynthesis and  photoconversion.  The U.S. and
              Japanese  participants are drawn from a wide range of  universities.  The
              purpose of the seminar is to  exchange up to date scientific information and 
              provide a forum for discussion of future U.S.-  Japan collaborative efforts.
