Abstract    :
              BENNER    Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is the dominant form of organic matter
              in most aquatic ecosystems and is one of the largest reactive reservoirs of
              organic carbon on Earth. DOM is the major source of carbon and energy for
              decomposer microorganisms. These microorganisms are responsible for most of the
              respiration and carbon and nitrogen cycling in aquatic ecosystems. These
              studies focus on the cycling of DOM in a shallow subtropical estuary that is
              highly productive and dominated by seagrasses. Biological and photochemical
              pathways are hypothesized to be interacting processes which dominate DOM
              decomposition. Thus, from an ecosystem perspective, sunlight can serve as an
              important energy source for the non-biological degradation of organic matter
              and the regeneration of nutrients.    Shallow aquatic ecosystems may be
              receiving a previously unrecognized energy subsidy from sunlight that enhances
              degradative and regenerative processes and thereby increases the overall
              productivity of the system. This is important because the interaction between
              the amount of sunlight an ecosystem receives and the rates of degradation have
              not been studied in detail in aquatic ecosystems. Sunlight may stimulate
              productivity both by enhancing photosynthesis and decomposition.
