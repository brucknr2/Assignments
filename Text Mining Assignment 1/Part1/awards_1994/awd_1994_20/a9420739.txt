Abstract    :
                                                                   Professor Perrin of the
              University of California San Diego will continue his investigations on  the
              effects of nonbonding electron pairs, on reactions, the asymmetry of hydrogen
              bonds in  solution and the effects of ion solvation on stereoelectronic
              properties.  Each of these has subtle  but significant effects on reaction
              rates and stereochemistry.  While they are reported in the  sense of basic
              research, the implications are of wide significance in organic, physical,
              theoretical  and biochemistry.    There are subtle electronic effects caused by
              nonbonded electrons, hydrogen bonds and solvation  of ions which have
              significant consequences in life processes as well as chemical manipulations.  
              Thus, the results of this investigation have broad spectrum potential impacting
              fundamental and  life sciences.
