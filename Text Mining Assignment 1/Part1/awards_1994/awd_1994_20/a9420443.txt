                                          ABSTRACT    AST-9420443  Wolfe, Arthur M.  Tytler,
              David    Drs. Wolfe and Tytler, at the University of California at San  Diego,
              will use spectra of absorption line systems toward Quasi-  Stellar Objects to
              explore gas located at moderate redshift  distances in the Universe (z < 5). 
              The observations will be  obtained using telescopes of the Keck and Lick
              Observatories.  Projects led by Dr. Wolfe will use the properties of damped
              Lyman  Alpha systems to investigate the gas contents, abundances and  dynamics
              of early galaxies.  Dr. Tytler will focus on the  intergalactic medium (IGM)
              and hot ionized gas.                                 ***
