Abstract    :
              9420041  Siegel-Causey   Large water birds-penguins, loons, grebes, albatrosses
              and shearwater, pelicans and allies, herons and storks- have been considered to
              comprise the earliest branching groups of birds.  This project will examine
              phylogenetic relationships among the pelican-like birds (Pelicaniformes) using
              molecular sequence data.  The phylogenetic framework will be used to address
              morphologic evolution as well as the evolution of social behavior in these
              birds.   %%%   The proposed study will help unravel the relationships among
              pelicaniform birds and their close relatives.  It will provide a better
              understanding of the patterns of molecular evolution in mitochondrial ribosomal
              genes.  It will also provide the knowledge necessary to address such
              macroevolutionary questions as whether the Pelicaniformes are a morphologically
              and ecologically diverse clade of birds or, if this diversity is simply an
              artifact of lumping  together unrelated species.   ***
