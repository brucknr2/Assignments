Abstract    :
              9420204  Bolte    Dr. Bolte's observational research project addresses four
              problems: 1) the  absolute age of the oldest globular star clusters in the
              Galaxy, 2) the age  dispersion among the galactic globular clusters and for the
              dwarf spheroidal  galaxies that are companions to the Milky Way, 3) the
              low-mass end of the  Population II star mass/luminosity function, and 4) the
              nature of blue  straggler stars in globular clusters and the frequency of their
              occurrence as a  function of stellar density and velocity dispersion within the
              individual  clusters and for different clusters.
