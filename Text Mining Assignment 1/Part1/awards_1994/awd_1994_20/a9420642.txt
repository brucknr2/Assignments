Abstract    :
              9420642  Flickinger    This project connects the American Film Institute to the
              Internet  over a T1 (1.54 bits per second) line.  The Institute is installing 
              a server to allow Internet access to its film and television  results. 
              Researchers at the Institute benefit from access to the  resources of the
              Internet, including libraries and supercomputers.   In addition, they are able
              to communicate and collaborate with  colleagues at other institutions in
              pursuit of research and  educational projects.  The award provides partial
              support of  the project for 18 months.
