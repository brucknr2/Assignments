Abstract    :
              9420671  Grannis       A group of faculty, support staff and graduate students 
              at the State University of New York at Stony Brook will  continue to study
              antiproton-proton annihilation reactions  at the Fermi National Accelerator
              Laboratory. (FNAL).  The  research aims to uncover fundamental components, the
              quarks  and leptons, basic to all matter, to determine their  properties and
              coordinate observations with predictions of  the standard model of elementary
              particles.  This is done  with the use of the technologically sophisticated
              complex  detector apparatus DO at the Teveatron particle collider in  a
              collaboration of physicists from institutions around the  world.  Partial
              support is provided for a program to improve  the apparatus to fit it better to
              a higher intensity  Tevatron now being developed.  ***
