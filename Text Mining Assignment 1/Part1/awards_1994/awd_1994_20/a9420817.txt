Abstract    :
              9420817  James   This award provides one-half the funds needed to acquire
              computer equipment consisting of 4 workstations, a CD-ROM mass storage device,
              and a color printer all to be installed in the Department of Terrestrial
              Magnetism of the Carnegie Institution of Washington (DTM-CIW). DTM-CIW is
              committed to providing the remaining funds necessary for the acquisition. The
              equipment will be used primarily by the geophysics group  at DTM-CIW who are
              actively involved in computationally data intensive research. The group
              currently operate 20 digital broadband portable seismograph units and 50
              digital borehole strainmeters in a number of seismic experiments worldwide.
