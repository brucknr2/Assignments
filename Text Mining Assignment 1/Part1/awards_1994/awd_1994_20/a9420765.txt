Abstract    :
              This proposal aims to develop theories for a better understanding  of the
              observational results of the ionospheric HF heating  experiments, and thus for
              leading a better planning of future  heating experiments.  The work will focus
              on:  (1) the role of  secondary parametric instability processes together with
              nonlinear  scattering processes on the generation of secondary stimulated EM 
              emissions (SEEs), (2) generation of ELF/VLF waves by thermal  instabilities
              excited in heater-modulated electrojet, (3) new  spectral features of plasma
              lines enhanced by obliquely incident HF  heater, and (4) physical process
              responsible for the generation of  energetic electrons in the context of weak
              turbulence theory.***
