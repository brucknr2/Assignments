Abstract    :
              9420013  Schultz    Because they lack mobility, plants have had to develop
              dynamic responses to changing environmental conditions and stresses such as
              insects and disease.  Most studies have examined responses to individual enemy
              species in isolation.  However, plants are attacked by communities of insects
              and diseases.  Many studies reveal considerable overlap in the key biochemical
              mechanisms of plant responses to various enemies.  We hypothesize that
              overlapping plant responses frequently yield overlapping effects on multiple
              enemies, determining which pests will actually infest a plant at any point in
              space or time.  We will test this hypothesis by examining the responses of
              several cucumber varieties to insect pests and diseases.  We focus on cucumbers
              because they have well-studied resistance mechanisms, insect pests, and
              pathogens.  First, we will characterize overlap in biochemical responses of
              individual plants to infection by a virus, bacterium, and fungus, and
              infestation with one of four cucumber-feeding insects.  We will then
              "challenge" these responding plants with each of the other pests and determine
              which biochemical mechanisms provide "cross resistance" to more than one. 
              Finally, the ecological importance of "crossed" or generalized resistance
              factors will be assessed by exposing young field-grown plants to the same
              infection/infestation treatments as above, but then allowing natural
              development of the pest community throughout the growing season, assessing both
              pest community accumulation and plant yield.    This research will put
              interactions among plants, insects, and plant diseases into a realistic
              community context.  The broad goal is developing a predictive plant-pest
              science that will provide improved plant breeding, genetic engineering, and
              cultivation practices for improved pest resistance and reduced crop losses, as
              well as understanding the development of plant-pest interactions.
