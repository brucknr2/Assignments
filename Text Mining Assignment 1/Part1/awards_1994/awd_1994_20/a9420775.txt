Abstract    :
                        9420775  Schaff  Despite considerable effort, the process involved in
              the  biosynthesis of endogenous cytokinin in higher plants is not fully 
              understood.  Currently, many researchers believe that plants  synthesize
              cytokinins using the same process that Agrobacterium-  transformed plants do. 
              The accepted route for the conversion of  14C-adenine into cytokinin is that
              the adenine is first converted  to AMP, which is then converted to cytokinin. 
              To date, the enzyme  has not been identified in intact higher plants.      In
              contrast to this commonly held theory, Van Staden and Drewes  (1993) consider
              that adenine may function as a substrate for the  production of cytokinin. 
              Their hypothesis predicts higher plant  endogenous cytokinin synthase (EITase)
              condenses IPP and adenine to  produce cytokinin.  The proposed research project
              intends to  develop direct support for this hypothesis using in vitro extracts 
              from adenine phosphoribosyltransferase-less (APRT-) mutants of  Arabidopsis to
              demonstrate the following: 1) the EITase uses  adenine to form i6Ade, the first
              cytokinin and 2) the levels of  adenine and cytokinins increase compared to the
              wild-type (APRT+),  which results in a phenotype that represents an
              over-accumulation  of cytokinin.  ***
