Abstract    :
              9420850  Hoogestraat    This proposal requests funds for Luzerne County
              Community College  to connect to NSFNET.  This connection will provide faculty
              access  to the resources available on the Internet (including, but not  limited
              to e-mail and educational LISTSERV discussion groups) and  provide students
              accesq to the resources available on the Internet.   These connections will
              provide operations management and  information services and it will give the
              college a 56 thousand  bits per second connection to the NSFNET, a high speed
              (1.5 - 45  million bits per second) National Backbone network.    The benefits
              of this NSFNET connection include e-mail between local  and remote researchers
              and educators, file transfer capability and  the ability to use remote computer
              resources.  Also the college  will have the ability to investigate innovation
              in educational  resources and incorporate them into their curricula.
