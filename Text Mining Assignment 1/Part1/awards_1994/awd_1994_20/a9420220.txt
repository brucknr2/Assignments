Abstract    :
                It is known that infant rodents and humans are visually less sensitive than
              adults of the same species, but the mechanisms for the change in sensitivity
              are not known.  This Small Grant for Exploratory Research project has a
              multidisciplinary approach with a biophysicist and an ophthalmologist
              collaborating on this problem.  A new technique is developed for measuring the
              photopigment, rhodopsin, inside the photoreceptor cells of the eye.  A novel
              kind of microspectrophotometer is being used to measure the absorption of light
              from within an area even smaller than the photoreceptor cell itself.  This
              microscale measurement allows estimates of the concentration of rhodopsin that
              is packed on the cellular membranes, and compare the values for infant and
              adult eyes.  This approach also allows measuring the lateral diffusion rate of
              rhodopsin within the membranes, which is important because it determines the
              rate of response of the cell, and so contributes to the sensitivity of the eye.
               This work will have impact on visual neuroscience and infant development, and
              the technology may well prove useful for other kinds of subcellular measurement
              techniques in biology.
