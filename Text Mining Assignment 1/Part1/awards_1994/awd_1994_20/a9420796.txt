Abstract    :
                9420796  Weeks    Hormones often exert dramatic effects on animal behavior, 
              yet the mechanisms by which they act on the nervous system  to alter behavior
              are not yet well understood,  The  identification of  mechanisms for
              hormone-nervous system  interactions is facilitated by studying animals with
              simple  and accessible nervous systems.  In this project, a group  led by Dr.
              Weeks will utilize the hawkmoth, Manduca sexta,  to study profound neural and
              behavioral changes in response  to developmental alterations in steroid and
              peptide hormone  levels.  A specific behavior during the initial phase of 
              metamorphosis in Manduca. pre-ecdysis behavior, is performed  to loosen the old
              cuticle before it is shed at each molt.  The performance of this behavior is
              attenuated at specific  times during development.   This work will correlate
              changes  in hormones with functional changes in specific identified  brain
              cells.  The results of this research will be relevant  to understanding neural
              mechanisms of hormonally-mediated  behavioral changes in a wide variety of
              living organisms.  ***
