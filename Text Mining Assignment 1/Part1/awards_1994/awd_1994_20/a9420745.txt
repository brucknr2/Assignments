Abstract    :
                This project involves the dissertation research of an anthropology student
              from UCLA.  The project will explore how culturally specific rules and criteria
              influence the choice of spouses in Mauritius to maintain ethnic boundaries
              through endogamy.   Through interviews and census data, marriage patterns in
              Mauritius will be determined, including rates of intermarriage between Creoles,
              Afro-Mauritians, Indians (Muslims and Hindus) and other ethnic groups.  The
              researcher will create a decision-tree model of mate choice to assess the
              nature of the decisions and values people use to maintain ethnic group
              boundaries.  This research is important because it increases the expertise
              available about t his area of the world, and advances our understanding of the
              nature of ethnic group boundary maintenance.  In the current `post-modern` era
              the importance of the nation-state with respect to ethnic groups is waning,
              thus research on the nature of ethnic boundaries is increasingly valuable.
