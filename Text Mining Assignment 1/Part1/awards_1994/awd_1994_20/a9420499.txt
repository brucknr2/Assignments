Abstract    :
                   Imaginative use of computational mathematics can provide  insight into some
              of the most difficult questions about nonlinear  partial differential
              equations.  Among these are problems of  transonic aerodynamics and plasma
              physics that appear  superficially not to be well posed, but become so when
              weak  solutions are introduced correctly.  Numerical analysis of the  weak 
              solutions is a major challenge to mathematics.  The investigator  conducts
              research in this area of applied mathematics in  collaboration with both
              graduate students and postdoctoral  assistants.       This project is concerned
              with the numerical solution of  nonlinear partial differential equations, and
              the principal  results are codes that work effectively on the latest generation
               of computers and have significant technological applications.  Emphasis is
              placed on research in high performance computing that  brings to bear on
              previous algorithms the advantages of parallel  architecture.  The investigator
              collaborates with mathematicians,  physicists and engineers, aiming at
              successful transfer of  technology to industry.  A principal area of study is
              the problem  of transport in magnetic fusion energy research.  This phenomenon 
              can be modeled by a Monte Carlo method that provides good  estimates of the
              transport.
