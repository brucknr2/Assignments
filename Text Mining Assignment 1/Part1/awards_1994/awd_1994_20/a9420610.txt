Abstract    :
              9420610  Viney     Nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), which together
              constitute the conserved family NOx, play a key role in the chemistry of the
              atmosphere, especially in the formation of tropospheric ozone. Natural
              emissions of these gases from agricultural soils may be comparable in magnitude
              in rural regions to those from know anthropogenic sources. In particular, the
              role of nitrogen based fertilizers spread over rural agricultural soils in the
              production/emission of NOx is not well documented. Rural emissions similar in
              magnitude to anthropogenic sources make development of effective strategies for
              reducing ozone concentrations problematic.   The objective of this proposal is
              to participate in an intercomparison study of methodologies for measuring NOx
              emissions from an intensively managed agricultural row crop. This study is to
              intercompare chamber and micrometeorological methodologies with extensive
              onsite characterization of soil physical and chemical properties, ambient air
              quality and atmospheric conditions.
