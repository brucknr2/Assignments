Abstract    :
              1                                                                               
                                                             PASTOR    Individual species of
              animals or plants can produce effects which are strongly manifest at the
              ecosystem or landscape level. The population dynamics of such organisms, or the
              elimination of such species, can have dramatic ecosystem impacts. Such an
              animal with such a strong ecological footprint is the moose. This project uses
              state-of-the-art tracking technology linked to a global positioning system
              (GPS) to study the effects of moose at Voyageurs National Park, MN. The project
              studies the energetic balance of individual moose, the effect of moose on plant
              species distribution, the animal's effects on soil nutrient cycling, and
              develops a simulation model to study foraging strategy of moose and the impact
              of moose on landscape patterns.    This research is valuable because it links
              behavioral and population studies with ecosystem and landscape level responses.
              The interfaces between these disciplines often do not overlap, although the
              two-way interaction between population biology and ecosystems ecology is often
              acknowledged. Three components of the research are especially well formulated
              and planned. First, the animal tracking work provides the detail necessary to
              examine animal behavior, foraging strategy, and spatially-explicit landscape
              effects. Second, the simulation model quantifies the impacts of this large
              grazing animal and may find application with numerous other large herbivores.
              Third, the research addresses animal linkages to processes such as nutrient
              cycling and decomposition in addition to structural components of ecosystems
              such as plant community distributions.
