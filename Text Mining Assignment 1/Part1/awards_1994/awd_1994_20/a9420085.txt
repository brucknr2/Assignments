Abstract    :
              9420085  Shapiro  Past reports suggest that Antarctic phytoplankton are 
              hypersensitive to small thermal changes.  However, actual  documentation is
              difficult because of problems associated with  currently available methods. 
              Documentation of cell death and/or  metabolic arrest, associated with changes
              in temperature less  than that associated with formation and retreat of sea
              ice, could  affect our understanding of Antarctic ecology.   This project 
              investigates the potential application of some recently developed  fluorescent
              probes in biomedical research  for evaluating  mammalian cell biology to
              biological oceanography, i.e.,  phytoplankton metabolic activity and cell
              death.   However,  fluorescent probes may or may not prove useful for
              evaluating the  physiological state of phytoplankton cells in response to 
              temperature stress.  If appropriate protocols are worked out,  biological
              oceanographers will be able to examine and evaluate  temperature responses of
              polar phytoplankton in response to  formation and retreat of polar sea ice.
