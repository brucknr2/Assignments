Abstract    :
              9420721  Bandy         The major objective of this research is to quantify the 
              efficiencies for the conversion of dimethylsulfide (DMS) to its  various gas
              phase oxidation products in a remote marine  atmosphere.  This information is
              fundamental to assessing the  significance of DMS as a precursor for
              atmospheric aerosol in the  marine environment.  An enhanced understanding of
              this linkage  will provide a basis for incorporating tropospheric aerosol into 
              global climate models and thereby contribute to a reduction in  the present
              large uncertainty in the calculated climate forcing  due to atmospheric
              aerosols derived from marine sources of DMS.       The experimental work plan
              is centered on the measurement of  sulfur dioxide (SO2), DMS, and carbonyl
              sulfide (OCS) during the  field portion of the Southern Hemisphere Marine
              Aerosol  Characterization Experiment (ACE-1).  A novel gas 
              chromatograph/quadrupole mass spectrometer (GC/MS) system will be  used
              on-board the NCAR C-130 aircraft platform to perform  measurements of these
              sulfur-containing gases.  This GC/MS  instrumentation will measure these three
              sulfur analytes at a  frequency of one sample every four to five minutes and
              with a  minimum detectability of approximately one part-per-trillion  (volume
              to volume).  These researchers will combine their  analytical data with other
              ACE-1 measurements to determine the  mechanisms, rates, and efficiencies of the
              chemical processes  that affect the formation, growth, distribution, and
              radiative  effects of atmospheric aerosols derived from sulfur gas  precursors.
