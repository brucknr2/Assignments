Abstract    :
              9420254  HAMRICK       The columnar cacti of the North American Sonoran Desert
              offer an excellent opportunity to analyze how plants interact with their
              pollinators to produce the patterns of matings that characterize their
              populations.  Each of the four species of cactus to be studied has large, open
              flowers visited by a shared set of pollinators (i.e. bats, birds, insects).  We
              will establish exclusion treatments to insure that individual flowers are
              pollinated by a single pollinator type.  Genetic analyses at multiple gene
              locations will then be used to describe the breeding structure of each
              pollinator-cactus species combination.  These analyses will allow us to
              determine how the different pollinators  distribute the pollen of an individual
              cactus species and will lead to a basic understanding of the relative
              importance of each pollinator to the overall breeding structure of each cactus
              species.         Knowledge of the roles that different pollinators play in the
              reproduction of these dominant plant species will allow more effective and
              efficient management of desert reserves.  For example, the determination  that
              bats may disperse pollen long distances leads to the conclusion that the
              preservation  of  bat roosts which may be outside of the reserve is an
              essential component for the maintenance of genetic diversity in the cactus
              populations.  If we find that a large proportion of  the effective pollinations
              are performed by a single pollinator species for each of the cactus species,
              .the maintenance of this pollinator would be essential to the reproduction of
              an individual cactus species and to the overall integrity of the Sonoran Desert
              community.
