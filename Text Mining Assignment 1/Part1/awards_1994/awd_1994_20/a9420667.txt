Abstract    :
                9420667  Rahman         As a result of the changed priorities in the power
              industry in  the United States, it is believed that environment-sensitive 
              planning with a focus on transmission open-access needs significant  attention
              in power engineering research.  A research effort is  proposed which will deal
              with environmental quality, impacts of  environmental considerations on
              reliability, and ways to  incorporate transmission cost in pricing the cost of
              energy with  environmental externalities.       The proposed research will
              integrate the environmental  considerations explicitly into the power system
              planning process  and incorporate load uncertainties arising from the
              possibility of  the loss of wholesale loads to external suppliers (due to 
              transmission open-access).  This will be accomplished by applying  the
              eigenvector (EVM) and the interdependent data analysis (IDA)  technique in
              extracting expert opinions on scenario likelihoods for  uncertainties related
              to transmission access.  ***
