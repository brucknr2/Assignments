Abstract    :
              9420087  Balamuth       Research will be carried out in high energy electron 
              scattering with the goals of determining the spin structure of  nucleons and
              observing manifestations of quark and gluon degrees  of freedom in the nucleon.
               With funding in the present proposal,  a new electron polarimeter will be
              constructed for use in the  Hermes experiment at the HERA facility in Germany,
              where this  research will be carried out.  Research in this area will advance 
              our understanding of the nucleon in terms of constituent quarks  and sea-quarks
              (quark-antiquark pairs surrounding the constituent  quarks).  This topic is
              among the most exciting in nuclear and  particle physics.  Education of
              graduate students is integral to  this grant and to the overall research
              program which will be  carried out.  ***
