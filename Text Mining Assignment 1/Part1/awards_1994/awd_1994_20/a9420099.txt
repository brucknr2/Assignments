Abstract    :
              This project is working to make rapid prototyping and reverse  engineering
              facilities available over wide-area computer networks.   It includes several
              research thrusts along with an integration  effort to ensure that the
              facilities will be usable remotely with  little on-site intervention.  The
              project has four major thrusts:   (1) development of algorithms for checking
              consistency of geometric  descriptions; (2) development of new languages based
              on  constructive solid geometry for communicating geometric  descriptions; (3)
              connection of rapid prototyping equipment to a  wide rear network, with device
              drivers and server software to allow  remote access; (4) connection of a 3D
              scanner to the network for  remote access.
