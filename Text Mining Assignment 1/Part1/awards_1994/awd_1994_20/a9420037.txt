Abstract    :
              In this request for an LTREB grant renewal the principal investigators describe
              results of previously supported  multi-year whole-lake food web experiment at
              Castle Lake, California.  The investigators then outline a design for continued
              whole-lake manipulations.  The project incorporates a continuous record of
              summer primary production dynamics dating back to 1959.  The investigators
              manipulated the Castle Lake food web by varying rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus
              mykiss) stocking rates from zero fish per year for a three-year period
              (1989-1991) to 30,000 trout per year ( or three times background rates) for a
              following three-year period (1992-1994).  Using a three- variable model they
              explained 77% of the interannual variability in Castle Lake primary production.
              This was regulated by negative relationships with total precipitation and
              winter snowfall and a positive one-year time lag.  Whole-lake food web
              manipulations produced perturbations in mean annual primary production on a
              scale  comparable to those seen for the climatic variables.  During the
              drought, 1989-94, mean annual primar y production values were at or higher than
              the highest values seen since 1959.  While trophic interactions among the
              microbial components of this and other lake food webs have been studied by
              other researchers, but direct comparisons of microbial dynamics in response to
              whole-lake climatic and food web processes have not been made.  Continued LTREB
              support will allow the investigators to complete Phase II of their
              investigation (30,000 trout stocked per year), and conduct a new cycle of low
              and high trout stocking rate manipulations.  They also will monitor microbial
              components of the food web (bacteria, picoplankton, mixotrophic phytoplankton,
              heterotrophic flagellates, and ciliates) into future whole-lake monitoring,
              food web manipulations. The proposed investigations will span a variety of
              spatial and temporal scales that will enhance understanding of whole-lake food
              web and microbial dynamics through longer term climate changes.
