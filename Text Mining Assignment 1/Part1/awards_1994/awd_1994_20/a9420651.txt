Abstract    :
              Martin  9420651    New Heavy alkali and light alkaline earth thioborate glasses 
              will be prepared and characterized for the first time.  While having some
              similarity to the analogous oxide borates,  these glasses have striking
              differences, such as the  formation rate of six to eight tetrahedral borons per
              every  added sulfide anion compared to two tetrahedral borons for  the alkali
              oxide borate glasses.  This research will explore  the relationship between
              nanometer length scale effects of  intermediate-range order and physical
              properties of glass.  Raman, Nuclear Quad Resonance, and neutron scattering 
              spectroscopies will be used to probe longer range  structures.  Nanosecond time
              scale measurements (Giga hertz  frequencies) of the conductivity and of nuclear
              spin lattice  relaxation will be used to probe the relationship between  these
              properties that arise from cationhopping dynamics in  these fast ion conducting
              glasses.  An attempt will be made  to develop a new class of chemically robust
              fast ion  conducting glasses that push the suitability envelope for  these
              materials in elechochemical applications.  The  proposed research seeks to
              probe deeper into the structure  of glass, long length scales, and farther back
              into the  dynamics of cation motion, shorter time scales, than ever  before. 
              These chaecognide glasses provide a nearly perfect  template upon which these
              experiments can be staged.  %%%  New heavy alkali and light alkaline earth
              thioborate glasses  will be prepared and characterized.  The research will be 
              aimed to explore the relationship between nanometer length  scale effects and
              physical properties of glasses.  ***
