Abstract    :
              Blyth/Abstract           The objective of this research is to investigate the
              formation  of raindrops in cumulus clouds.  Existing observational data from 
              several previous field experiments will be used.  Additional  measurements are
              proposed in a new field experiment (SCMS) to be  deployed in Florida
              (July-August, 1995). The results of this  research will provide a better
              understanding of the length of time  and the sizes of cloud droplets involved
              in producing raindrops in  cumulus clouds, how the largest cloud droplets are
              formed, and how  entrainment and mixing influences the cloud droplets.
