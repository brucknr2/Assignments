Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    AST-9420454.   Salah, Joseph E.  The 37m-diameter Haystack radio
              telescope is the primary astronomical instrument of the Haystack Observatory, a
              facility owned by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and operated
              under agreement with MIT by the Northeast Radio Observatory Corporation
              (NEROC), a nonprofit consortium of 13 educational and research institutions. 
              The Observatory is a broadly multidisciplinary facility, and includes not only
              the 37m Haystack Radio Telescope, but atmospheric and satellite tracking radars
              and research groups, lidars, and geodetic and astronomical VLBI groups.  The
              Haystack radio telescope was built in 1964, primarily for use as a radar
              antenna in the 8-10 GHz range. At present, more than 80% of telescope time is
              used for radio astronomy.  In the middle 1980's, a series of upgrades to the
              antenna were carried out which have permitted reasonably efficient operation at
              7mm wavelength and limited operation at 115 GHz.  Observing time at Haystack is
              made available to qualified astronomers solely on the basis of scientific
              merit.   This award will support astronomical research and education with the
              37m antenna for a period of three years. Graduate and undergraduate research
              projects will be encouraged in order to provide training opportunities for
              students in scientific research, experiment design and instrumentation
              development and usage. Observations with the telescope during this period will
              exploit the antenna's abilities to make high-resolution 3mm maps of
              astronomical objects on arcminute scales in the continuum as well as in a
              number of molecular transitions.  This work will help reveal physical
              conditions within dense molecular cloud cores, thus enhancing understanding of
              the star formation process, and will probe the structure of radio sources
              within the Galaxy.  A search will also be carried out for highly redshifted
              emission from quasars in order to investigate the interstellar processes which
              occur in young galaxies.  ***
