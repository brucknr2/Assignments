Abstract    :
              9420963  Lutz  Wesley College proposes to network the entire campus and to
              provide  a link between the institution and powerful computing facilities 
              worldwide using SURAnet.  This connection will also afford improved  sharing of
              resources by and with other educational institutions by  providing connectivity
              with federal and state agencies and  institutions of higher education
              worldwide.      The benefits of the Internet connection include e-mail between 
              local and remote researchers and educators, file transfer  capability and the
              ability to use remote computer resources.  Also  Wesley College will have the
              ability to investigate innovation in  educational resources and incorporate
              them into their curricula.
