Abstract    :
                  9420988  KATSOUROS    The National Academy of Sciences, through its Ocean
              Studies Board  (OSB), provides guidance to the National Science 
              Foundation/Division of Ocean Sciences and other Federal Agencies on  major
              ocean science policy issues.  This request is for continued  partial Core
              Support for the OSB.  The OSB plans to consider  scientific issues related to
              coastal oceanography, the carbon  dioxide cycle, biodiversity and partnerships
              between the Federal  Government and the Oceanographic academic community.  The
              OSB will  also support US scientists to provide leadership in the Scientific 
              Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR) of the International Council  of
              Scientific Unions (ICSU).  The OSB will, thus, continue to  contribute to
              maintaining the health of Ocean Sciences in the US  and to furthering
              international cooperation in Ocean Sciences.
