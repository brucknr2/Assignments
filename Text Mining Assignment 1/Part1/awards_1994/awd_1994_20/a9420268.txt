Abstract    :
              9420268  Specker      Mammals lactate and birds produce crop sac milk to feed
              their young.  Fishes are known to guard their young in a nest or to brood them
              in their mouth.  Dr. Specker's finding of vitellogenin, the precursor for yolk
              proteins, in the surface mucus of mouthbrooding cichlids suggests that some
              fish may be supplying the young with nutritionally important molecules in
              addition to protecting them from predators.  She is examining aspects of
              reproduction in two species of cichlids that exhibit parental care.  The
              species differ in that one is a maternal mouthbrooder and the other is a
              paternal mouthbrooder.  The oral cavity of these fish contains paired
              pharyngeal glands.  She proposes to examine the biochemistry of secretions from
              the glands.  If it is found that the pharyngeal glands in mouthbrooding tilapia
              are secreting highly nutritive vitellogenins for ingestion by the offspring,
              then a major step toward changing the conventional wisdom about the
              evolutionary significance of parental care in this class of vertebrates may
              occur.  Such biochemical and physiological contributions would provoke
              additional debate about the evolution and endocrinology of larval-parental
              relationships.  ***
