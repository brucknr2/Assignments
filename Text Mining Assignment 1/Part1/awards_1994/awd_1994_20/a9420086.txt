Abstract    :
              9420086  Rowell  This award supports a series of workshops by the Antarctic 
              Lithosphere Working Group (LWG).  This group affords a broad  conduit for
              exchange of information between the earth sciences  program within the US
              Antarctic Program (USAP) and the diverse  parts of the earth science community.
               As such it is a forum for  discussion of the future goals of Antarctic geology
              and  geophysics research and the future needs of researchers from the 
              operational portion of the USAP.  More specifically, the group  brings to the
              program, ideas about new scientific and technical  opportunities, programmatic
              needs, and programmatic opportunities  as perceived by the wider earth science
              community.  The LWG also  serves to provide feedback to the program on
              logistical support  questions relating to the USAP.  In providing this
              function, the  LWG constitutes a useful management tool to help integrate 
              science goals with operational portions of the US Antarctic  Program.  ***
