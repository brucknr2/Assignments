Abstract    :
              9420233  La Duke   Combining detailed knowledge of the morphology and breeding
              systems of plants of the cotton or hollyhock family Malvaceae with new
              molecular data from restriction enzyme analyses of chloroplast DNA, the team of
              Drs. John La Duke and Paul Fryxell is studying taxonomic relationships among
              the 110 genera of this important group of tropical and temperate-zone plants. 
              Representative samples from nearly all genera are being acquired throughout the
              world, for extensive surveys of morphology, chromosome number, and DNA data. 
              Analyses of the combined datasets promise to provide robust estimates of the
              phylogenetic or genealogical relationships among all the genera.  In turn, the
              genealogical framework will guide the testing of ideas about historical
              patterns of migration and dispersal and about the origins of the family and its
              major subgroupings.   The combination of traditional morphological analyses
              with new DNA data, applied to a large and interesting group of plants, many
              with economic value (cotton, okra, hibiscus, hollyhock), promises to provide a
              sound phylogenetic framework for comprehending the evolution and biogeography
              of Malvaceae.  ??
