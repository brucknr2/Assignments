Abstract    :
              9420592  Morris    ABSTRACT     The faculty in the Colleges of Engineering,
              Science and Earth and Mineral Sciences at the Pennsylvania State University
              have combined to develop a curriculum in advanced computation that emphasizes
              the capabilities and uses of parallel computers.  The goal of the program is to
              train undergraduate and graduate students in advanced computation.  This will
              be achieved through the development of a sequence of undergraduate and graduate
              courses that involve the hands-on use of different parallel machines, the
              development of software demonstrations for class use, and the use of
              high-technology classrooms.  The courses will form the basis for a new "Minor
              in High Performance Computation."  The course will be taught by faculty in
              different departments and colleges and will emphasize the common aspects of
              high performance computation that cross the boundaries between disciplines. 
              The project will be evaluated by an external advisory panel with members drawn
              from academia and industry with expertise in advanced computation and pedagogy.
               Student evaluations will be developed and administered.  Information about the
              project will be available by provision of external electronic access to
              computer-based classroom demonstrations, by publicity through the Engineering
              Coalition of Schools for Excellence in Education and Leadership (ECSEL),
              through training workshops for instructors, and through the development and
              distribution of traditional course materials.  ***
