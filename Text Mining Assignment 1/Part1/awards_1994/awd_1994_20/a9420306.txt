Abstract    :
              This is an accomplishment-based renewal based on previous work in  probabilistic
               reasoning  and  qualitative  probabilities  within  computational
              implementations.  Some important problems are to be  addressed   in   the  
              acquisition  and  processing   of   causal  information. These include (1)
              learning of causal structures from  empirical   data   using   combinations  
              of   observations   and  manipulations  and  (2)   planning  under  uncertainty
               by  using  qualitative  approximations of probabilities and utilities.   The 
              approaches to be pursued are indirect experimentation,  syntactic  derivations 
              , and feedback mechanisms.  The short  term  results  are  expected  to  be
              improved reasoning methods in  applications  such   as   medical  diagnosis, 
              sensor  fusion,  and   automated  management and control of manufacturing 
              processes.
