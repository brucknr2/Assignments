Abstract    :
              This project conducts enabling research on virtual prototyping  tools for
              collaborative design, construction, and startup of  semiconductor manufacturing
              facilities.  This extends and  integrates ongoing research within the Center
              for Integrated  Facilities Engineering and the Center for Integrated Systems at
               Stanford.  The focus is not on design of actual projects or  processes, but on
              the implementation and startup of the factory  building and support systems of
              the manufacturing enterprise.   Research is being performed in collaboration
              with Intel, which is  providing specifications and is guiding testing of theory
              and  software.  The resulting tools will radically shorten the time to  bring
              new semiconductor facilities on-line.
