Abstract    :
              9420004  Wang   The PIs will study abundantly and exquisitely preserved fossil
              borophagine canids, distant relatives of living canines (dogs, wolves, foxes,
              and jackals) to determine their evolutionary relationships, patterns of
              origination and extinction and their ecologic role in the biological community.
                %%%   Living in the last 2-30 million years in the North American Tertiary,
              borophagines represent a large group of carnivores with over 66 species and
              exhibit an ecological diversity much greater than their modern canine relatives
              ranging from small ominivores like living raccoons to extremely power
              predators/scavengers like living hyena.  Results of this study will shed light
              on the evolutionary history of a group of carnivores that played dominant roles
              among their contemporaneous predatory mammals and thus helped shape the
              vertebrate community over the last 30 million years.   ***
