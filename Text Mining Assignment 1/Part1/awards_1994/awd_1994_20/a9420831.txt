Abstract    :
              9420831  Curtin  This project will develop the general concepts needed to 
              predict the damage accumulation and ultimate failure of  materials subject to
              slow damage formation.  This work will  develop models to describe the scaling
              of failure times and  distribution on system size and on the underlying damage 
              formation rate by using stochastic methods to calculate the  time evolution of
              the damage distribution.  Numerical  simulations of the damage evolution using
              newly-developed  efficient algorithms based on lattice Green functions will  be
              utilized to verify and guide the analytic model  development.  An important
              goal will be to identify well-  defined precursors to the failure, such that
              failure can be  anticipated.  The models developed here will also provide a 
              broad framework for interpreting experiments.  Relationships  between the
              spectrum of experimental data will be  elucidated.  %%%  This theoretical
              project involves investigating the  accumulation of damage in a variety of
              materials.  Both  modeling using equations and also computer simulations using 
              newly-developed algorithms help to understand damage.  How  damage accumulates
              is directly related to failure, i.e.,  when the material breaks.  The work
              involves applying models  for specific systems in materials such as ceramics, 
              polymers, composites, metals, bones, and earthquake faults.  This research
              area, spanning physics and materials, is  underrepresented in the Materials
              Theory Program, so it is  one of high priority.  ***
