Abstract    :
              We are requesting $72,000 from the National Science Foundation to  purchase the
              Applied Biosystems ProciseTM Protein Sequencing system  from Perkin Elmer. This
              will replace the Applied Biosystems 470A  Protein Sequencer, now at the end of
              its useful life, and allow us to  use the 477A Sequencer either as a backup
              amino-terminal sequencer or  as a carboxyl-terminal sequencer. The ProciseTM
              Sequencer will give the  Molecular Genetics Instrumentation Facility here a
              sequencing capacity  equal to or greater than the present capacity even if both
              current  instruments are retired. This will allow undiminished sequence 
              determination for all users of the facility, particularly for sequence 
              determination of proteins from hyperthermophiles, proteases and  inhibitors
              involved in protein processing and development of diseased  states, proteins
              involved in methane and C02 metabolism and in  degradation of cellulose,
              proteins employed as redox carriers in  microbes and proteins involved in
              mammalian fertilization. The carboxyl  terminal sequencing capacity will enable
              us to more easily obtain  complete sequences of proteins using PCR technology,
              confirm sequence  changes near the carboxyl terminus of site-directed
              mutagenized  proteins, help elucidate the specificities of proteases and their 
              inhibitors, help identify peptides in terms of their sequence position  and
              help complete sequencing of peptides and proteins.
