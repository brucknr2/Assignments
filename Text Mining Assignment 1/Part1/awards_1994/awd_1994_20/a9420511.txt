Abstract    :
              9420511 Hirth   This research examines mixed-mode loading effects on the
              fracture and fatigue behavior of metal alloys.  A high purity steel and a
              special aluminum alloy, for which base-line data already exist, are the focus
              of the study.  Mechanical property measurements include low-cycle fatigue and
              fracture tests under mixed mode type I-II-III loading, with multiaxial and non
              proportional loading conditions.  Deformation and fracture behavior are
              characterized by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron
              microscopy.  Theoretical modeling includes a continuation of dislocation
              modeling of the onset of failure in the form of a localized shear deformation
              by a translating and bowing discontinuous tilt wall.  Theoretical work employs
              finite element modeling of crack propagation in terms of a damage mechanism
              associated with the mode II and mode III loading components. %%% This research
              is of fundamental importance in material design standards since it establishes
              the mechanism of degradation of fracture toughness under mixed-mode I-II-III
              loading.  It also examines the role of such loading on damage under low-cycle
              fatigue. ***
