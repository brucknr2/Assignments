Abstract    :
              This award supports a study to use biological indicators, namely  fossil records
              of cryptoendolithic microbial colonization of  Beacon sandstone and
              microorganisms in permafrost, to reconstruct  paleoclimate history of the Late
              Plio-Pleistocene period in the  McMurdo Dry Valleys.  The work will attempt to
              address the  stabilist versus the dynamicist view of the Antarctic ice sheet 
              using past and present occurences of distributions of  climatically sensitive
              living and fossilized biological  indicators in the Dry Valleys region. 
              Specifically, soil derived  from Beacon Sandstone and permafrost cores will be
              analyzed for  the occurence of living and fossilized microbial groups whose 
              viability zones are already known or will be determined by  mapping the
              distribution of present occurences.  This information  will be integrated with
              the distribution of characteristic  exfoliation patterns (recent and fossil)
              caused by microbial  activity to reconstruct relative age sequences.  The 
              sedimentology of the permafrost cores will be characterized and  integrated
              with microbiological and chronostratigraphic data.  Absolute chronologies will
              be provided (where appropriate) by  carbon-14, thermoluminesence dating and
              analysis of cosmogenic  radionuclides.
