Abstract    :
              9420141  Parker    A pivotal mutualism in the dynamics and productivity of
              natural and agricultural ecosystems is the plant/fungus ectomycorrhizal
              symbiosis.  This study joins two distinct approaches and investigator
              backgrounds, field ecology and molecular biology, to provide the first rigorous
              field test of the hypothesis that specificity in plant-fungal mycorrhizal
              interactions may influence forest succession rates and patterns. 
              Ectomycorrhizal community structure and plant-fungus specificity patterns will
              be determined by a combination of soil coring, seedling bioassays, mushroom
              collections, and molecular methods.  By working in conifer forests that span a
              successional age series, long-term dynamics of the mycorrhizal fungi can be
              assessed.  Experiments are planned that (1) determine the diversity and
              dynamics of fungi that can form ectomycorrhizae in 3 age classes of conifer
              stands, (2) statistically test conflicting hypotheses regarding mycorrhizal
              specificity, (3) test conflicting hypotheses regarding the nature of early vs.
              late fungi in a disturbance ecosystem, and (4) determine whether mycorrhizal
              fungi are partitioning along spatial/temporal gradients.    This study will
              provide a first glimpse into ectomycorrhizal community structure and dynamics
              in mixed conifer forests on a regional scale, and will provide insight into its
              importance in conifer forests.  This research will also provide expanded and
              refined molecular methods to investigate mycorrhizae for widespread use by
              ecologists.
