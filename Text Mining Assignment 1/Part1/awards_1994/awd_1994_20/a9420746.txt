Abstract    :
              9419200  Gould    Dr. Gould will develop new methods of extracting additional
              information  about the massive compact objects (MACHOs) that have recently been
               detected in ongoing experiments.  Dr. Gould will undertake several inter- 
              related investigations aimed at laying the basis for practical measurements of 
              additional MACHO parameters.  There are three basic approaches to  extracting
              additional parameters: (1) measure the MACHO parallax; (2)  measure the MACHO
              proper motion; and (3) measure the distribution of  MACHOs.  The PI will pursue
              all three approaches.
