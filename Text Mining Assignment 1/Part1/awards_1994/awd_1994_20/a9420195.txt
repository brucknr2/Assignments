Abstract    :
              9420195  Bowers     There is much information regarding the responses of animals
              to changes in the size and configuration of their habitats, but there is little
              scientific information concerning which processes underlie those responses. 
              While much is known about how local populations respond to variation in habitat
              quality, and something about how individuals and populations respond to habitat
              patches, there has been little experimental work that connects these processes
              at the population and landscape scales.  This study uses the meadow vole,
              Microtus pennsylvanicus, in an ecological model system (EMS) approach. 
              Researchers will create 12 replicate microlandscapes, each comprised of four
              habitat patches, where the ratio of good to poor habitat patches and dispersal
              rates among patches are under experimental control.  Local patch quality will
              be manipulated by adding supplemental food, and dispersal rates will be
              manipulated by either mowing or not mowing areas between patches.  This design
              allows one to tease apart the relative importance of within- and between-patch
              processes to local and regional population dynamics.     The present lack of
              information connecting population and landscape processes greatly hinders the
              ability to mange natural systems and to minimize anthropogenic effects
              involving habitat destruction and fragmentation.  Studies like the present one
              are critical to developing process-based, sound species management plants.
