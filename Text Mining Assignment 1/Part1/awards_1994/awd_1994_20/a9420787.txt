Abstract    :
              9420787  Nathan  Research will be carried out in high energy electron
              scattering,  photonuclear reactions, and in fundamental properties of the muon 
              with the goals of determining the spin and flavor structure of  nucleons,
              observing manifestations of quark degrees of freedom in  nuclei, and in probing
              the hadronic structure of the muon (a  twenty-fold improvement on the
              determination of the muon's  anomalous magnetic moment).  Research in these
              areas will advance  our understanding of the nucleon in terms of constituent
              quarks  and sea-quarks (quark-antiquark pairs surrounding the constituent 
              quarks) and probe TeV mass scale hadrons and how they affect  electro-weak
              processes through radiative corrections.  These  topics are among the most
              exciting in nuclear and particle  physics.  Development and construction of
              major state-of-the-art  equipment, including laser-pumped polarized gas
              targets,  specialized detectors, and spectrometers, is integral to this 
              activity.  Education of graduate students and postdocs is  a  strong component
              in every aspect of this umbrella grant for the  Illinois Nuclear Physics group.
