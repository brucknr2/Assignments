Abstract    :
              9420283  Barneby   The species-rich American tropics remain poorly documented,
              and this obtains even for woody plants important in agroforestry.  Dr. Rupert
              Barneby of the New York Botanical Garden is conducting fundamental taxonomic
              studies of the leguminous trees of several genera in the tribe Ingeae,
              including the mimosa relatives Calliandra and Pithecellobium.  From study of
              extensive collections of herbarium material and past field work in selected
              sites in South America, he is describing and classifying ca. 200 species native
              to the Neotropics, placed in four genera.  Older classifications have confused
              the generic limits of American, African, and Asiatic representatives of these
              groups, and thus prevented biogeographical analysis of migrational history. 
              Barneby's monographic research will provide precise descriptions for all the
              species, reliable identification keys, accurate mapping of the geographical
              distributions of the taxa, and synthesis of the taxonomic relationships among
              the groups.    Taxonomic monography, also characterized as alpha-level
              taxonomy, provides comprehensive documentation of the species resources for a
              major lineage of organisms.  For the woody legumes of the Calliandra and
              Pithecellobium complex, Barneby's research will complete the study of a major
              portion of the American tropical Leguminosae.  ??
