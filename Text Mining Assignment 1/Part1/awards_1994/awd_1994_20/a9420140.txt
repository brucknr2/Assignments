Abstract    :
              9420140  Richardson   Initiated in 1954, the annual Systematics Symposium
              sponsored by the Missouri Botanical Garden in St. Louis, and held in October of
              each year, has highlighted significant research, training, and policy issues in
              biological systematics throughout its impressive duration.  Topics of interest
              both to botanists and zoologists have been emphasized, and efforts made as well
              to involve scientists in under-represented groups.  The 1995 symposium
              addresses the role of systematists in the National Biological Service, and
              features speakers from academe, government, and private organizations.  Future
              symposia cover biogeographic, paleontological, molecular phylogenetic, and
              technological aspects of modern research in biological systematics.  The
              symposium proceedings are typically published in the Annals of the MBG, and in
              timely manner, and thus the impact of the presentations and discussions extends
              throughout the profession and beyond.   Complementing the symposium
              presentations and discussions, participants, usually numbering 400 or so, make
              use of the rich herbarium and library resources of the Missouri Botanical
              Garden, and the mix of graduate students, young investigators, and senior
              researchers ensures a productive exchange of viewpoints.  ??
