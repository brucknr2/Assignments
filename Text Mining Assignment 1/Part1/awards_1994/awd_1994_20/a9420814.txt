Abstract    :
                This project involves a summer institute in comparative anthropological
              research.   The institutes will be supported for 3 years at the Claremont
              college in California.  Building upon a previous 3-year series of summer
              institutes, the purpose is to teach the state-of-the-art in comparative and
              cross-cultural research to professional academic anthropologists and other
              social scientists.    Issues to be taught include primary data comparisons,
              within-region versus world-wide comparative research designs, and comparisons
              where the historical period varies versus comparisons within one time. 
              Preference is given to applicants with the Ph.D. who teach research methods to
              graduate students or undergraduates in the US.  This institute is an important
              resource for advancing our technical capacity to study and explain the
              variation in culture in the world.
