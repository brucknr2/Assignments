Abstract    :
               This research involves two cultural anthropologists from CUNY and Fordham
              Universities in New York  in a study of the local reaction to anti-Mafia
              activities in Palermo, Sicily, Italy.   The researchers will live in a
              lower-class neighborhood of the city and study the reactions of people to the
              tension in contemporary Italian society between reformers who wish to change
              the nature of Sicilian civil society to give less support and encouragement to
              Mafia activities, and the `Sicilianist` reaction to anti-Mafia activities which
              defends local identities, language and customs against a `modernist` critique
              which is seen as disloyal to Sicily.   Using techniques of participant
              observation the anthropologists, both fluent in local languages and very
              familiar with local cultural and historical issues , will study the successes
              and failures of the contemporary anti-Mafia movement.   This research is
              important because as the European common market (and other such agreements such
              as NAFTA) expands to control more cultural and social issues, the tension
              between democracy movements of restructuring local civil society are being
              undermined by regional nationalism.  Understanding in depth of one case study
              will illuminate general processes in common with other situations, and aid
              policy makers in the search for improved democracy which is sensitive to local
              history and culture.
