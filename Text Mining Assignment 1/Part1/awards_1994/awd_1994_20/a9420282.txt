Abstract    :
              JACKMAN, TRISKA, and DUFF    The interface between ground water and surface
              water is a dynamic boundary where strong gradients in nutrients, dissolved
              oxygen, and redox potential occur. This interface zone, termed the hyporheic
              zone, exerts considerable influence on the biotic communities of streams and
              rivers, the flux of nutrients from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems, and upon
              the hydrology of streams, rivers, and floodplains. This project focuses upon
              this dynamic interface with emphases on the cycling of nitrogen and effects on
              aquatic macrophytes. The project combines a thorough study of hydrology of the
              hyporheic zone with the biogeochemistry and biological interactions at this
              interface.    This research will yield significant progress in coupling the
              hydrology and biogeochemistry of catchments at the terrestrial/aquatic
              interface. Riparian zones have been shown to provide buffering capacity for
              reducing the import of excessive nutrients of terrestrial origin into aquatic
              ecosystems. These initial studies on this filtering capacity of this interface,
              however, have not been coupled to a rigorous characterization of the hydrologic
              flow paths in space and time within this zone. This project quantifies major
              components of nitrogen cycling along known flow paths and follows the impact of
              these processes to the biota of stream and river ecosystems.
