Abstract    :
                What accounts for the size and shape of the head and face region of humans and
              our relatives continues to be a critical area of study for anatomists and
              paleoanthropologists.  The approach of Hylander's group has been to
              characterize patterns of surface bone strain along the face bones of a monkey. 
              Then, in combination with various sorts of anatomical and physiological data,
              the strain data are used to formulate and test different hyptheses about
              loading patterns in various facial bones.  One of the primary goals is to
              determine whether, how much, and in which direction a given bone is bent,
              twisted and/ or sheared during different chewing and biting behaviors.  These
              data the allow some insight as to whether certain aspects of the primate face
              are structural adaptations to dissipate chewing forces.  This work will help
              explain why primate (including human) facial bones look the way they do.  This
              is particularly important for formulating functional and adaptive
              interpretation of the fossil record of both human and nonhuman primates. 
              Moreover, by characterizing the mechanical environment of facial bones, these
              data may provide insights into how and why facial bones respond to various
              sorts of altered mechanical stress, and thereby contribute to a better
              understanding of processes related to skeletal maintenance of mechanical
              strength.
