Abstract    :
                9420972  Luh       Scheduling power systems and determining inter-utility
              power  transactions are important activities faced by electric  utilities. 
              These two activities form an integrated problem since  they are coupled through
              system demand and reserve requirements.   The objective is to supply reliable,
              economic and clean power.   This problem is becoming very important because of
              the  deregulation trend making the power market more competitive, and  because
              of the Clean Air Act making utility operating conditions  more stringent.  The
              University of Connecticut, with support from  Northeast Utilities Service
              Company, proposes to explore three  vital and closely linked areas:  (l) a
              Lagrangian relaxation  based fuzzy optimization approach for short-term
              scheduling and  transaction to handle uncertainties such as transaction and
              fuel  prices and system demand; (2) transaction and scheduling for a  long time
              horizon up to one year with the consideration of  emission constraints and
              transmission line capacity constraints  by using the time aggregation idea; and
              (3) a new class of  algorithms to optimize the concave, piecewise smooth, and
              non-  differentiable Lagrangian dual functions by exploring their  geometric
              characteristics for improved performance.  These areas  form a synergistic
              research program, with one area leading to the  next and supporting the others.
               Our aim is to help utility  engineers make effective scheduling and
              transaction decisions  based on sound mathematical principles, and to advance
              the state-  of-the-art and practice of optimization techniques for systems 
              characterized by uncertainties in general and power systems in  particular.
