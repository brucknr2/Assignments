Abstract    :
              9420858  Oliver       This proposal requests funds for Rust College to connect
              its campus  network to NSFNET.  This connection will be done via SURAnet.  This
               project will provide operations management and information services  and it
              will give the college a 56 thousand bits per second  connection to the NSFNET,
              a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per  second) National Backbone network.   
              The benefits of this NSFNET connection include e-mail between local  and remote
              researchers and educators, file transfer capability and  the ability to use
              remote computer resources.  Also the college  will have the ability to
              investigate innovation in educational  resources and incorporate them into
              their curricula.
