Abstract    :
              This proposal is composed of both research and continued operations  of the
              neutron monitors at Climax, Colorado and Haleakala, Hawaii.   The motivation
              for research is to understand the physics of the  electrodynamical processes in
              three dimensions in the inner  heliosphere, with special emphasis on the
              solar-terrestrial region.   In addition, the PIs will continue their long-term
              studies of the  apparent bimodal character of cosmic ray modulation through the
               next solar minimum.  Finally, the PIs wish to implement the  continuation of
              the Climax and Haleakala neutron monitors extending  into the solar minimum
              period with the same level of precision  maintained over successive solar
              activity cycles.
