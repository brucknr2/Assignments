Abstract    :
              The project develops a virtual prototyping facility for the design  of
              mechanical assemblies containing polymer composites.  Design  approaches are
              investigated for lowering the cost of manufacturing,  especially methods which
              replace mechanical subassemblies by a  unitary composite part.  A suite of
              automated design tools is  developed for virtual prototyping of assemblies made
              of polymer  composite materials AND making these tools accessible on the 
              Internet.  Industrial relevance is insured by direct participation  of a
              midsized company specializing in advanced polymer composites  design and
              fabrication.
