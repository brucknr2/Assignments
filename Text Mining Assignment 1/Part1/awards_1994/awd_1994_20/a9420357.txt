Abstract    :
              9420357  Chartoff  This research deals with a family of diacrylate liquid 
              crystalline monomers that can be photopolymerized to produce  functional parts
              in the stereolithography process.  These  materials will be designed to have
              low shrinkage approaching  zero) when polymerized in the ordered state; will
              maintain  their order after polymerization so as to retain  preferential
              anisotropy; and will have glass transitions  (Tg) approaching 200C because of
              their rigid rod segmental  structures, orientation, and high degree of
              crosslinking.  The project will have two major objectives:  The synthesis  and
              characterization of liquid crystalline diacrylates and  process optimization
              and construction of model parts in the  stereolithography process with layered
              molecular alignment  directions similar to ply orientation in continuous-fiber 
              composites.  These may be referred to as "self-reinforcing"  composites.  The
              appropriate orientation sequences will be  determined by a part design
              incorporating stress analysis    This is an interdisciplinary project in the
              Rapid  Prototyping Initiative involving personnel with backgrounds  in chemical
              and materials engineering, chemistry, and  physics.  It also will involve a
              collaboration between the  University of Dayton and Case Western Reserve
              University.  The research emphasis will be on the engineering aspects of 
              materials processing in stereolithography.  The University  research team will
              work with an advisory group of  individuals from industry who have a direct
              interest in the  outcome of the project.  ***
