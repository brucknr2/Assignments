Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    AST-9420460.   Rogers, Alan E.     Millimeter-wavelength very long
              baseline interferometry (VLBI) achieves the highest angular resolution in
              astronomy--typically 50 microarcseconds at 3mm and 20 microarcseconds at 1mm. 
              Only such resolutions can begin to reveal the compact astrophysical structures
              associated with the massive central engines of active galactic nuclei such as
              quasars and BL Lacertids, and only at millimeter wavelengths does one minimize
              the inherent limitations of continuum VLBI due to scattering by the
              interstellar plasma and optical depth effects. The millimeter band is also rich
              in molecular masers whose structure can only be resolved by VLBI.   This three
              year award will provide support to form and operate a "Coordinated mm-VLBI
              Array" (CMVA).  Replacing previous ad-hoc efforts in this field by a the
              unified scheduling, support and analysis infrastructure, the CMVA will make
              mm-wave VLBI available to all astronomers, not just those who are experts in
              the technique.  The CMVA will consist of a core group of mm-wave observatories
              who have agreed to make approximately two weeks per year available for VLBI; an
              additional group of facilities will make time available on a per-proposal
              basis.  The CMVA will be managed out of the Haystack Observatory. which is also
              one of the CMVA's core institutions.  Haystack will coordinate the solicitation
              and review of mm-wave VLBI proposals from the astronomical community, and will
              coordinate scheduling, hardware and tape allocation, as well as in absentia
              data correlation; it will also provide the technical support necessary to make
              the CMVA reliable and fully functional, will loan two data acquisition systems
              to various CMVA sites, and will continue to develop advanced VLBI
              instrumentation.    ***
