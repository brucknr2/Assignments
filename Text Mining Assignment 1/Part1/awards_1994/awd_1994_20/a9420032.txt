Abstract    :
              This group proposal seeks funds to purchase three major  items of equipment: a
              cryostat, a compound, research-grade  microscope and a confocal microscope. 
              These items will be  housed in the Histological Facility at the Monell Chemical
               Senses Center and will be utilized Center-wide.  The  equipment is requested
              by eight major users for research  programs directed at a fuller understanding
              of the chemical  senses.  The projects utilize standard histology, lectin and 
              immuno-histochemistry, in situ hybridization and in situ  PCR, and focus on a
              range of issues from intracellular  localization of proteins and neucleotides
              in peripheral  sensory receptor cells to metabolic activity within large  organ
              systems, e.g. the brain and the liver.
