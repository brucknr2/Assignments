Abstract    :
              9420560  Rezayi  Numerical work is proposed to investigate some outstanding
              problems  in the phonomenon of the fractionally quantized Hall effect, which 
              is observed in a two-dimensional electron gas subject to a  transverse magnetic
              field.  The electron layer is formed at the  semi-conductor interface of a high
              quality gallium-arsenic  heterostructure semi-conductor device.  The proposed
              research  addresses the nature and properties of the Fermi-Liquid state  formed
              at even fractions of the lowest Landau level occupation,  novel parafermion
              quantum Hall states and the physical conditions  which stabilize them, edge
              states, the quantum fluid to classical  Wigner crystal transition, and optical
              properties of quantum Hall  state.  %%%  This research is aimed at
              understanding the behavior of a  system of electrons (carriers of electric
              current) confined  spatially to a plane and subject to a perpendicular magnetic
              field  as prepared in gallium-arsenic heterostructure devices.  Under  suitable
              conditions the electrons exhibit the phenomenon of  Fractional Quantum Hall
              Effect.  The phenomenon results from the  condensation of electrons into a
              highly collective state with the  little semblance of their initial individual
              characteristics.  This  is the subatomic realm of quantum mechanics - an area
              of  considerable scientific interest.  In addition, the quantum Hall  effect
              has potential technological applications in semiconductor  industry.  This RUI
              research will be carried out at  California State University, Los Angeles - a
              predominantly  undergraduate minority institution - and will involve both 
              undergraduate and Master's level students.
