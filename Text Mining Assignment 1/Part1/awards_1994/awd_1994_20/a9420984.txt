Abstract    :
              9420984  Grunwald  A new method for mutagenizing zebra fish (Danio rerio) will
              be developed and optimized. Mutations will be induced in mature sperm with
              ethylnitrosourea, a potent point mutagen. Founder zebrafish derived from such
              mutagenized sperm are a rich source of new mutations and can be selected by a
              failure to complement pre-existing mutations. There are three features of this
              method which make it a potentially powerful source of new mutations: Germ lines
              will harbor independent mutations at a frequency of 1-2% at  any pre-specified
              locus; the germ lines of the founders are genetically mosaic; preliminary
              studies indicate that most of the induced mutations are intragenic mutations. 
              The goals of this proposal are to optimize the mutagenesis procedures and to
              establish the frequency of germ line specific locus mutations in the founder
              population; to demonstrate that new and informative mutant alleles of a
              developmentally important gene can be recovered; and to recover and analyze
              mutations that affect single genes encompassed by a deletion mutation.  %%% 
              Zerbrafish are rapidly becoming important experimental organisms for the study
              of development. However, while their are many advantages to their use, one
              serious disadvantage is the lack of an easily manipulated genetic system. The
              development of a method to generate new and different developmental mutants for
              analysis will serve the purpose of  optimizing this system .   ***
