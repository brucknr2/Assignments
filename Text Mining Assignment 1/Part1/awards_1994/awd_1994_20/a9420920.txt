Abstract    :
              9420920  Cox  This project addresses two pressing theoretical questions in  the
              area of superconducitivity.  First, what is the origin  of superconductivity in
              the heavy fermion materials?  Second, can the odd-in-time reversal Cooper pair
              really be  found in a physical system?  To address these questions, 
              superconductivity in the heavy fermion materials will be  studied using a
              variety of techniques based upon the primary  assumption that it arises from
              odd-in-time-reversal Cooper  pairs whose microscopic origin is in the
              two-channel Kondo  model using a variety of techniques.  Effects of doping, 
              disorder, and symmetry breaking fields will be studied as  well.  Several
              phenomenological approaches will also be  attempted.  This study should answer
              definitely whether the  two-channel Kondo model is a viable candidate for a 
              comprehensive theory of heavy fermion superconductivity and  whether
              odd-in-time-reversal pairing may have a solid basis  in these materials.  %%% 
              In this work a variety of theoretical techniques is used to  study a class of
              materials known as heavy fermion materials.  In some ways these materials act
              as if the electrons have a  much larger mass than an isolated electron.  These
              materials  are of special interest because at low temperatures they 
              superconduct in a way that cannot be understood using the  traditional theory
              of superconductivity.  Here a particular  model will be studied to see if it
              agrees with the known  properties of heavy fermion superconductors. 
              Understanding  superconductivity in these materials should contribute to  the
              theory of superconductivity in high temperature  superconductors, with the
              ultimate goal of being able to  design materials which are superconducting at
              higher and  higher temperatures.  ***
