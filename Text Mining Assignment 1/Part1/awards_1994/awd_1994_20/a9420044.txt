Abstract    :
              The PIs will study solar and stellar magnetic cycles and  chromospheric activity
              using a dedicated fiber-fed spectrograph  facility at Lowell Observatory.  The
              goals of this research will  (1) discern the nature and relative importance of
              three effects  which produce observed solar and stellar variability, i.e., the 
              long-term activity cycle, rotational modulation, and short-term  stochastic
              variability; (2) infer the time history of cyclic  behavior for a star like the
              Sun over its entire lifetime,  including information about the statistical
              frequency of major  departures from "normal" behavior; (3) obtain a broad
              perspective  on the total ensemble of stellar cycles possible, thus gaining 
              insight into the nature of stellar dynamos and the effect of  stellar magnetism
              on the radiative output from the stellar  envelope.
