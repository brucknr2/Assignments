Abstract    :
              9420699  Metzger  The goal of this project is the synthesis of electron 
              donor-acceptor molecules that can be used as fast unimolecular  rectifiers of
              electrical current at the ultimate molecular, or  nanometer, limit of
              electronic processes. The molecules will be  tested as one molecule thick
              Langmuir-Blodgett films configured  on metal substrates such that the molecular
              conductivity can be  studied by scanning tunneling microscopy. In addition, 
              photo-excitable molecules will be synthesized and tested as  unimolecular
              photodiodes, and suitable doping schemes will be  devised to explore the
              behavior of these devices as molecular  transistors.    %%%    This
              interdisciplinary research project will cover aspects of  chemical synthesis,
              physical characterization, and the design of  fast unimolecular rectifiers,
              photodiodes, and transistors at the  ultimate molecular or nanometer scale of
              electronic behavior.  This proposed study is crucial to the development of next
               generation, molecular based electronic devices particularly in  view of
              advances in this area in Europe.
