              Mankin The focus of this research is the function of different regions of
              ribosomal RNA. A new approach for identification of functionally significant
              rRNA segments is proposed. Namely, an expression library of random rRNA
              fragments will be screened for RNA species which can affect ribosome functions
              in  vivo. The efficiency of the approach has been tested in preliminary studies
              where an active rRNA fragment conferring resistance to the ribosome targeted
              antibiotic erythromycin has been isolated from a random library of rRNA
              fragments. Analysis of the function of the erythromycin resistance RNA is one
              of the aims of the research. Further, functional selection protocols will be
              used to identify clones which express other active rRNA fragments that 1) alter
              sensitivity to ribosome targeted antibiotics, 2) interfere with ribosome
              assembly and rRNA processing, 3) affect accuracy of translation and 4)
              interfere with protein biosynthesis. Genetic and biochemical analysis will be
              used to determine structural requirements for biological activity of the
              selected rRNA fragments and the mode of their a ction. This should lead to a
              better understanding of the functions of corresponding rRNA regions in the
              ribosome. %%% All proteins in the cell are synthesized by ribosomes. The
              ribosome is composed of ribosomal RNA and protein molecules. Function of the
              ribosomal RNA is the subject of the proposed research.  A new approach will be
              used in the proposed research. Ribosomal RNA will be cut into small random
              pieces. Functional fragments will be isolated and their function studied. An
              attempt will be made to identify fragments of the ribosomal RNA that can
              influence assembly of the ribosome, accuracy of protein synthesis and
              sensitivity to antibiotics. In general, the proposed approach should lead to a
              better understanding of the functions of rRNA in the process of protein
              biosynthesis. ***                                 @
