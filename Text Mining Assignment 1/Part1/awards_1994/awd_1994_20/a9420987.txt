Abstract    :
              Harris    Under the direction of Dr. John Harris, Mr Kyara Onesphor will 
              collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will conduct both  field and
              laboratory analysis and study stone tool assemblages  from sites located at
              Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania. He will focus on  materials included in the Bed II
              geological strata which are  significant because they document a major
              archaeological and  physical transformation in human evolution. Stone tools
              recovered  from this interval are made on a number of different raw  materials
              and archaeologists wish to know what insight this  variety might provide into
              early human behavior. Mr. Onesphor  will analyze the tools by typology and by
              raw material. He will  also conduct experiments to determine which kinds of raw
               materials are best suited to specific functions. He will then  travel to
              Olduvai gorge, locate raw material sources, collect  specimens and note the
              distances to archaeological sites. With  the data thus collected he hopes to
              reconstruct aspects of the  cognitive and land use systems of early hominids.  
               The research will produce data of interest to many  archaeologists. It will
              shed new light on the development of  human capabilities and assist in the
              training of a promising  young scientist.
