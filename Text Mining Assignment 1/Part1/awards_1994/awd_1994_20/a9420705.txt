Abstract    :
              94-20705  Smyth  The Principal Investigator will conduct a theoretical study of
              the dynamics, structure, and escape of Io's atmosphere.  The objective is
              two-fold:  To understand (1) the vertical transport dynamics and gross
              structure of the satellite's atmosphere and (2) the escape rate and velocity
              distribution of neutral gases at the satellite's exobase.  The long-term goal
              is detailed aeronomy studies that include multi-species chemistry.     The work
              will couple 1-dimensional (1-D) hydrodynamic models of the lower atmosphere
              with kinetic models of the middle and upper atmospheric regions.  A 2-D
              description will be developed for the mid-levels to determine the interactions
              of the co-rotating heavy-ion plasma flow with the neutral lower atmosphere. 
              The chemistry of such chemical species as sodium, potassium, sulfur, and sulfur
              oxides will be considered.    This project will further our understanding of
              Io's atmosphere, the interactions of the atmosphere with the magnetospheric
              plasma, the nature and composition of the heavy ion sources for Jupiter's
              plasma torus, and the effect of these gases on the satellite's magnetosphere.
