Abstract    :
                This project involves the collaborative research of two social scientists, one
              at Brown and one at Harvard University, in rural Mali, West Africa.   The
              researchers are interested in explaining variations in women's' (and
              children's) health.  The research design is to compare two communities of
              different ethnicities living in different ecological zones, who face different
              environmental constraints and have contrasting systems of production (one
              agricultural, one agro-pastoral).  The researchers will examine the effects of
              these variables on the social networks, both kin and non-kin, that women can
              draw upon to gain social support and accrue resources for health.  The research
              design will also examine the seasonality of health outcomes.  Methods include
              focus group discussions, semi-structured interviews, a sample survey of 1000
              women spread across 10 villages, 5 in each ethnic group, wealth rankings of
              each community, a household census and specific questionnaires relating to
              social networks and health.   Respondents will also be measured and weighed to
              assess their growth status.  This research is important because the health of
              children is crucial to their growth and development, and the health of mothers
              is a critical determinant of their children's health.  Advances in our
              understanding of how ecological and seasonal variations in non-mechanized
              agricultural and agro-pastoral economies affect health is important for
              planners to design policies to safeguard and improve the existing situation.
