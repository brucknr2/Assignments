Abstract    :
              9420585  Rosenbaum  Three questions  will be investigated and the answers will
              provide a practical focus for future work on the subject of silicon dioxide. 
              First, physical experimentation will be used to study reliability of very thin
              oxides and to discover deficiencies in the current understanding.  Second,
              through analysis of experimental data and extensive discussions will
              reliability engineers from industry, present models for oxide reliability will
              be evaluated and note will be made of those which are considered inadequate. 
              Finally, a determination will be made as to which aspects of oxide reliability
              will, in practice, limit the reliability o future integrated circuits.  A
              variety of circuit types will be considered, such as, logic circuits,
              non-volatile memories, and DRAM, as different circuits may be limited by
              different oxide reliability problems.    The final goal of this work is
              incorporation of models for oxide reliability in a design-for-reliability CAD
              tool; however, the focus of the activities on reliability physics and modeling
              rather than on algorithm development.  Since development of a useful design
              tool provides the motivation for this research, significant effort will be made
              during the grant period to interact with the intended users of such tools,
              namely, industrial reliability and design engineers.  ***
