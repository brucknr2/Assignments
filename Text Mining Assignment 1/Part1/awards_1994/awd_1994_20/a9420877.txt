Abstract    :
              9420877  Tulane   The Tulane University Fish Collection - a "National Center"
              Category collection with over 6 million fluid-preserved specimens in more than
              168,000 lots, is the largest collection of post-larval fishes in North America.
               The existing catalog for the Fish Collection is a hand-written ledger in nine
              volumes.  There are no data cross-references available (e.g., catalogs of
              holdings by state, species, etc.).  Thus, the task of providing information on
              holdings to potential users is extremely burdensome.  Computerization of the
              Fish Collection catalog will permit immediate and efficient respond to complex
              information requests and thus enhance use of the collection in research. 
              Computerization will also make the collection records available to the user
              community over the internet so that researches can access the data at their
              convenience.  Georeferencing the collection data will permit investigators to
              spatially relate material in the collection, ultimately providing distribution
              maps of holdings by species and other taxonomic groupings to potential users. 
              Latitude and longitude coordinates provide a standard geographic referencing
              system that supersedes all other location descriptions and thus is important to
              networking efforts.  Finally, having coordinate data will help enhance the
              Tulane Fish Collection as a repository for  repetitive, time-series samples in
              ecological, environmental and conservation research.
