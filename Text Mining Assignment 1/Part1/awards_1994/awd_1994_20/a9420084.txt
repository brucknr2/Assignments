Abstract    :
              9420084  Topoleski  An SGER award will support feasibility testing of a 
              conceptual coating process which involves alternating steps  of ion
              implantation and plasma deposition.  The aim is to  combine the excellent
              adhesion created by the ion implanted  mixed layers with the more rapid
              deposition of material by  the plasma technique. The coatings will be processed
              at a  facility in Russia which has the capability of switching  between the two
              processes without sample removal or bpeaking  of the vacuum.  The integrity and
              strength of the coatings  will be determined by scratct testing and microscopy.
