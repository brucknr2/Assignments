Abstract    :
              Pattern formation in plants depends upon the precise spatial  and temporal
              control of cell growth.  To dissect the  molecular mechanisms controlling
              pattern formation, these  investigators have isolated Arabidopsis mutants with
              altered  body organizations.  One of these mutants, emb30, is unable  to form a
              true root, a true hypocotyl, stems, or flowers.  Instead, most emb30 seedlings
              contain only abnormal  cotyledon tissue and sometimes an abnormal shoot apical 
              meristem.  As a result, emb30 mutants are seedling lethals.  Microscopy
              analysis has shown that EMB30 is essential for  normal cell division, cell
              expansion, and cell adhesion in  plants and molecular studies have revealed
              that a region in  the predicted EMB30 protein is similar to a region in the 
              yeast Sec7 protein, which is involved in the secretory  pathway.  The PIs have
              termed this region the Sec7 domain.  Two other open reading frames, one from
              humans and one from  C. elegans, also contain Sec7 domains.  The goal of this 
              proposal is to define the specific role of EMB30 in cell  growth and organ
              development.  Cell biology and molecular  techniques will be employed to
              examine the effect emb30  mutations have on undifferentiated tissue and adult
              organ  development.  Experiments in which the EMB30 gene is placed  under the
              control of an inducible promoter will also allow  the examination of the role
              of EMB30 in the initiation and  maintenance of organs, such as the root.  To
              elucidate the  specific function of EMB30 in plant cell growth, the  components
              of processes that have been shown or suggested to  be affected in emb30
              mutants, such as glycoproteins and the  cell wall, will be analyzed.  The
              subcellular localization  of the EMB30 protein will also be determined. 
              Experiments  to determine if EMB30 can complement a yeast sec7 mutant  will
              also be performed.  In addition, an Arabidopsis EMB30  homolog will be cloned
              and characterized.  These experiments  should elucidate the specific function
              of EMB30 in  particular, and provide i nsight into the processes  regulating
              cell growth and pattern formation, in general.
