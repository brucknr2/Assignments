Abstract    :
              9420583  O'Melia    ABSTRACT       The proposal is presented in five major
              components.  First are described the four major research thrust areas related
              to contaminant transport, fate, and remediation within which our proposed
              educational objectives will be implemented.  This theme represents an important
              and timely topic both in research and in engineering practice.  Curriculum
              development is then discussed, including a description of new courses for our
              revised program, modifications to existing courses, and detailed examples of
              plans for integrating modeling and measurements into selected courses.  The
              participants in the proposal are briefly described.  In addition to Hopkins
              faculty, these include interested individuals from private and government
              sectors, to help bring real-world problems into the classroom and to assist in
              designing a program that will produce graduate who are to advance the practice
              of environmental science and engineering.  Next we describe our plans for
              ongoing, substantive project evaluation and assessment, as well as for
              dissemination of results.  Finally, we conclude with a detailed schedule of
              activities.  ***
