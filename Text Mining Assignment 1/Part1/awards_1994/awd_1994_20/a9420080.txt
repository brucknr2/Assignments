Abstract    :
              Abstract     AST-9420080  Peterson, Bradley M.  .    The variability of the
              broad emission lines in the spectra of active galactic nuclei (AGN) reveals
              fundamental information about the structure and kinematics of the line-emitting
              region and about the nature of the central source. Broad emission lines arise
              in clouds that are photoionized by a central continuum source and respond to
              variations in the continuum flux with a delay due to light-travel time; the
              structure and velocity field of the broad-line region can be determined by
              closely monitoring the response of the emission lines as the region
              reverberates in response to the continuum variations, making repeated
              observations of a limited number of sources. This is an ongoing project, as
              part of the International AGN Watch.
