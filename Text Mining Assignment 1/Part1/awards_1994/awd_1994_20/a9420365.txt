Abstract    :
              This project is creating a design paradigm for solid free-form  fabrication,
              based on that for VLSI.  Elements of the VLSI paradigm  to be translated to the
              mechanical domain include one-directional  information flow, the clear
              delineation of levels of abstraction,  formulation of design rules and design
              libraries, and the  development of intermediate representations for storage and
               transmission of various levels of abstraction of a design.  Several  types of
              structures that are ill-suited to present design methods  are the motivation
              for new languages, libraries, and tools.  These  include surface textures,
              functionally gradient materials, and  thermally and chemically active
              materials.  All of these structures  require instantiation of cells, possibly
              parameterized, which is  not well supported by current languages such as .stl.
