Abstract    :
              9420694  Persson    The New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology's 
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Energetic  Materials is
              being funded for one year under the "Self-Sufficient  Partnership for Research"
              Program.  The Center continues to meet  the renewal criteria of the
              Industry/University Cooperative  Research Centers Program.    Additional
              funding is provided for an evaluator to study the  university/industry
              interaction occurring in the Center.    Funding is also provided for an
              undergraduate student to augment  the Center's ongoing research program with a
              study on "Small Scale  Safety Research."    The Program Manager recommends New
              Mexico Institute of Mining and  Technology be awarded:  $38,000 for one year
              (includes $8,000 for  an evaluator); and $5,000 for one year with funds
              provided by the  Research for Experience Undergraduates Program.
