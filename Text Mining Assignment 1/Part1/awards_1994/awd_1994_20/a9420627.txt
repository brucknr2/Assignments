Abstract    :
              This project will conduct fundamental theoretical research on  selected topics
              in the collective behavior of dusty plasmas with  applications to phenomena in
              dusty space.  The physical effects  studied include (1) grain charging, (2)
              grain dynamics and  transport, and (3) waves, instabilities, and anomalous
              transport.   This research will investigate how realistic attributes of grains 
              in space such as finite grain size affects grain charging processes  such as
              secondary electron emission and photoemission.  The  research will specifically
              address the motion of dust grains or  aerosols in noctilucent clouds and polar
              mesospheric clouds in the  Earth's ionosphere.  The proposed research will
              substantially  advance knowledge in the collective behavior of dusty plasmas.
