              9420297  Brown, Jerram                              Abstract                    
                           Students of natural selection do not agree on the way in  which
              selection has determined the natural mating  preferences of wild animals.  For
              example, it is unclear  which male qualities are preferred by females and why. 
              Do  they prefer males who will feed their young; or males whose  genes will
              cause the offspring to be more vigorous and  competitive, or both?  A
              prerequisite for studying this  problem in nature is an accurate means of
              identification of  fathers.  The P.I. is employing new technology, namely DNA 
              microsatellites, for this purpose.  With accurate  information about actual
              genetic fathers the P.I. will then  characterize them according to their role
              in feeding young,  their dominance rank and other individual qualities that 
              might be correlated with competitiveness in their offspring.  The P.I. s
              studies will be among the first to provide  accurate information on the
              qualities of males actually  chosen by females in a complex avian social system
              in which  female choices are not constrained by a system in which  territories
              are owned exclusively by pairs.
