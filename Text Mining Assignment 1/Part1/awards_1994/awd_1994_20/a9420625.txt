Abstract    :
              Wu   9420625  The genetic basis of hybrid sterility between Drosophila simulans
              and Drosophila mauritiana has been shown by this laboratory to be clusters of
              strongly interacting loci which jointly lead to male sterility. One of the
              clusters is between the f and Bx marker, occupying about 5% of the X
              chromosome. The objective of this proposal is to clone and characterize a
              hybrid sterility gene, Ods, which is an important component of that cluster.
              After cloning and characterizing the gene, it will be used to test the various
              evolutionary hypotheses at the molecular level. Specifically, we will test for
              the most significant feature of Haldane's rule, the very rapid evolution of
              hybrid male sterility.  %%%  The genetic basis of speciation and species
              differences is undoubtedly one of the central questions in evolutionary
              biology. It is crucial to clone and characterize a gene which can be identified
              as having a role in functional divergence between species in order to
              understand the molecular basis of speciation. Such a cloned gene will make it
              possible to experimentally test the various contending evolutionary hypotheses
              at the molecular level.  ***
