Abstract    :
              9420612  REINERS  Nitrous oxide (N2O) is an important greenhouse gas that is
              increasing in concentration by about 0.3% per year.  Humid tropical forests
              account for 25-40% of the annual global emissions of N2O, and the conversion of
              forests to pastures or agriculture initially increases the emission rate to
              very high levels.  These high levels of gas emission are sustained in
              ecosystems where fertilizers are applied, but the rates of emission can drop
              precipitously in pastures and unfertilized fields.  Accurately estimating the
              atmospheric input of nitrous oxide on a regional scale must account for such
              complexity and provide estimates of the variance which is occurring.  This
              project develops and test two models which more accurately characterizes the
              regional flux of nitrous oxide to the atmosphere from humid tropical forests.
