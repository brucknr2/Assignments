Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to build a haptic interface to a mechanical  design system. 
              The objective is to demonstrate that part  interaction, assembly, and
              manipulability can be evaluated without  physical prototypes.  Visual
              interactions are provided by a CRT  screen, while haptic interaction is by
              means of force reflecting  telerobotic master arms, which the user wears as an
              exoskeleton.   Instead of controlling slave arms in a remote environment, the 
              masters affect a virtual world in which the  prototype assembly  exists. 
              Geometric and functional reasoning determine part contact,  interference, and
              the propagation of forces and torques.  Visual  rendering techniques display
              the current state of the assembly.   Haptic rendering techniques feed back
              appropriate forces to the  master arms, enhancing the effectiveness of the
              interface.
