Abstract    :
              9420873                              ABSTRACT         This grant will partially
              support a six-week research  workshop on cross-linguistic issues in sign
              language to run  concurrently with, and as part of, the six weeks of the 1995 
              Linguistic Society of America (LSA) Summer Institute at the  University of New
              Mexico in Albuquerque. The workshop has four  objectives. First it will allow
              scholars trained as linguists who  also are fluent in a sign language to come
              together in order to  address a well-defined set of empirical questions about
              sign  language structure and its linguistic representation. The answers  to
              these questions will take us a step further in distinguishing  what is
              language-particular about sign structure from what is  common to all sign
              languages. The group of sign languages  targeted in this workshop are: Italian
              Sign Language, Norwegian  Sign Language, Langue des signes quebecoises, Sign
              Language of  the Netherlands, Japanese Sign Language, Hong Kong Sign Language, 
              British Sign Language, and American Sign Language. The second  objective of the
              workshop is to facilitate the formation of new  cross-linguistic sign language
              research based on a common set of  theoretical tools, to be presented in the
              lectures and readings  of the workshop. The third objective of the workshop is
              to lay  the groundwork for an edited volume on the topic of  cross-linguistic
              issues in sign language phonology and  morphology. Finally, by conducting this
              workshop at the LSA  Summer Linguistic Institute we expect to open the
              discussion of  cross-linguistic issues in sign languages to interested groups
              of  students and scholars and to facilitate interdisciplinary work  concerning
              the analysis of gesture and sign.
