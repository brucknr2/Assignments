Abstract    :
               This project involves the research of a cultural anthropologist from
              Pennsylvania State University.  The project will test the evolutionary
              significance of a system of social paternity among a tribal group in lowland
              Venezuela which allows multiple males to claim paternity of a child.  When
              paternity is recognized, the adult has responsibilities to care for the child
              as a parent.  The hypothesis is that some mothers (in regions with high male
              death rates due to homicide) will claim that men have paternal ties to the
              mothers' children in order to increase their own, and their children's chances
              of successful survival.  The project will collect reproduction data on about 70
              women to add to the investigator's data base, and will complete data on about
              800 children.     This research is important because it will test a theory of
              the positive functions of `multiple paternity` in a relatively simple
              forest-dwelling social group.  This will advance our understanding of the
              likely social arrangements of primitive social groups in human history.
