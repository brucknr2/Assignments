Abstract    :
              9420593  Cowin    ABSTRACT     Active biomedical researchers in a consortium of
              five institutions will collaborative in the development of a first year
              graduate core curriculum in biomedical engineering.  The curriculum will be
              part of a newly established New York Center for Biomedical Engineering (CBE). 
              The five institutions in the CBE consortium are the City College (CCNY) of the
              City University of New York (CUNY), the CUNY Medical School, the Hospital for
              Joint Diseases of the New York University School of Medicine (HJD), the
              Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) of the Cornell University Medical College
              (CUMC) and the Graduate School of CUMC.  The core curriculum will enable
              beginning graduate engineering students to take an organized ancillary program,
              beyond their own engineering specialty, in biomedical engineering, and it will
              enable graduate students to obtain the Ph.D degree in a traditional engineering
              discipline with biomedical emphasis.  Five courses of an interdisciplinary and
              interinstitutional (based at the City College) core program on cell and tissue
              engineering are to be developed.  The five course set will include cell and
              tissue-material interaction, cell and tissue mechanics, cell and tissue
              transport, cell and tissue imaging and cell and tissue signal processing and
              instrumentation.  The research expertise of the biomedical researchers in the
              consortium lies in biomaterials, biomechanics, biotransport, instrumentations,
              imaging and signal processing.  ***
