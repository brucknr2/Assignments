Abstract    :
              9420422  Hannah  Can transposable elements give rise to functional introns? This
               laboratory has recently demonstrated that the maize transposable  element,
              dissociation (ds) and one copy of the duplicated host  sequence can be spliced
              precisely from the from the primary  transcript. In effect, the Ds element has
              created an intron. A  working model of the "intron-late" hypothesis has thus
              been created  and will be tested and characterized by determining the effects
              of  surrounding sequences on Ds splicing, determining the sequence 
              requirements of the 8 bp host duplication on Ds splicing,  determining whether
              fit to consensus of exon/intron borders is  needed for Ds splicing and
              determining whether the Ds-turned intron  confers any change on the gene.   %%%
               A controversy exists as to whether introns, sequences which  although
              transcribed from the DNA of (primarily) eukaryotic cells  are spliced out to
              create a functional message, were created early  in evolutionary history and
              served the purpose of providing  flexibility in the creation of genes by
              providing "movable  cassettes" or whether they are simply sequences which have
              been  randomly inserted into genes late in evolutionary history and serve  no
              functional purpose. The characterization of a known and well  described
              transposable element in corn as a newly created intron  would lend support to
              the "intron-late" theory.     ***
