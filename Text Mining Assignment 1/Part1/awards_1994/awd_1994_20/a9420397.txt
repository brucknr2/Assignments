Abstract    :
              The methods of rapid prototyping are ideally suited to  rehabilitation devices. 
              Because each person requires unique  performance and function in a
              rehabilitation device, devices  specific to each person must be rapidly
              designed and produced.   This project is investigating a completely integrated
              approach to  the design and prototyping of passive mechanical rehabilitation 
              devices.  The approach involves:  the quantitative assessment of  the form and
              performance of human limbs; the design of the  assistive device; evaluation of
              the device using virtual  prototyping; feedback from the consumer and
              therapist; actual  prototyping of the device; evaluation of the function and 
              performance of the device; and redesign based on performance.  The 
              contributions of the product include: the development of new  computer-based
              tools for the assessment of human performance; a  manufacturing technique for a
              new class of hyperelastic materials;  the integration of tools into a rapid
              prototyping system for  rehabilitation devices; and development of mechanisms
              for  systematic evaluation of the final product.
