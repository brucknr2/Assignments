Abstract    :
              9420604  Muller    This supplement provides funding for a Small Grants for
              Exploratory  Research (SBER) award for the University of California, Berkeley's
               Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Sensors and  Actuators. 
              The funds will augment the research of an ongoing  Center project entitled
              "Silicon Integrated Optical Systems for  Robotic Sensor Applications," to
              enable preliminary work on  untested and novel ideas in microoptomechanical
              systems.    This research addresses the integration of micro optical systems on
               silicon, for potential applications in robotic sensing, automatic  optical
              alignment, tunable filters and lenses for fiber-optic  communication systems nd
              holographic displays.  This advance is now  made possible by advances in
              microelectromechanical systems and  binary optics.  This award, In the SGER
              mode, supports initial  exploration of optimal technologies, and methods for
              design and  layout of microactuated optical elements.  Prototype designs will 
              be fabricated and tested    These funds are being cost-shared by the Robotics
              and Machine  Intelligence Program, Division of Information, Robotics and 
              Intelligent Systems and the Solid State and Microstructures  Engineering
              Program of the Division of Electrical and  Communications Systems.    The
              Program Manager recommends the University of California,  Berkeley be awarded
              $40,000 for one year for this SBER award.
