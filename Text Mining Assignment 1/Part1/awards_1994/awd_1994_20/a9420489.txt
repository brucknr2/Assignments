Abstract    :
              9420489  Asmerom   This award provides partial (35%) funding for the acquisition
              of a thermal ionization source mass spectrometer to be installed and operated
              in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at the University of New
              Mexico. The institution is committed to providing the remaining funds necessary
              for the acquisition. Recent developments in mass spectrometry and actinide
              chemistry have made the acquisition of high-quality data possible for a variety
              of earth materials. The new mass spectrometer system will be used in research
              on crust-mantle dynamics, chronology of magma evolution under the continents,
              and continental paleoclimatology.  ***
