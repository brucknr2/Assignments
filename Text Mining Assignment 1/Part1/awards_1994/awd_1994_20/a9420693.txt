Abstract    :
              9420693  Thompson    Underground pipelines and storage tank systems can develop
              leaks  over time and cause significant environmental damage.  A number of 
              Government Agencies have jointly recognized this concern and are  joining
              together to facilitate a research and development program  to be undertaken
              jointly by the New Jersey Institute of  Technology's Industry/University
              Cooperative Research Center for  Emission Reduction and Iowa State University's
              Industry/University  Cooperative Research Center for Nondestructive Evaluation.
                 This proposal address the initiation phase of an envisaged broad  scope,
              multi-year project.    The Emission Reduction Research Center (ERRC) will be
              responsible  for the interface with he sponsoring Agencies, EPA, DOE, DOD, and 
              NSF.  ERRC is conducting a needs assessment, with particular  emphasis on
              environmental and regulatory compliance issues.  These  initial activities are
              to identify existing leak detection/leak  location equipment; assess
              modifications to regulatory and  operating needs; develop experimental plan
              leading to  modifications; and develop bench scale studies leading to new 
              technologies and protocols.  All field testing will utilize the  pipeline
              systems at the EPA UST/Pipeline Test Apparatus in Edison,  New Jersey.    The
              Center for Nondestructive Evaluation is responsible for  assessment of
              technology, based initially on the existing EPA  technology and literature
              information.  This Center will survey  industry consensus on the effectiveness
              of available technologies  and conduct experimental studies of current acoustic
              emission  techniques.    The researchers are fully qualified to perform these
              studies.    Funding for this project is being provided by EPA, DOE, DOD and 
              NSF.    The Program Manager recommends Iowa State University be awarded 
              $196,872 for one year for its portion of this project with funds  provided by
              the U.S. Department of Navy's Naval Facilities  Engineering Service Center.
