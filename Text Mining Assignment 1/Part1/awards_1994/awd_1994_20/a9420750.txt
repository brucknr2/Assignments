Abstract    :
                                          Abstract  9420750  Jong    This award renews partial
              support of a large collection of yeasts and fungi maintained by the American
              Type Culture Collection (ATCC).  The collection currently consists of
              approximately 26,000 strains representing in excess of 6,500 species and 1,500
              genera, and includes a wide variety of fungi and yeasts used in genetic,
              medical and agricultural research as well as strains needed for production of
              food, pharmaceuticals and other chemicals.  Though large, the collection
              represents less than 10% of the known species of these organisms.  Currently,
              about 500 new strains are placed in the collection each year.  On request and
              for a small charge, the ATCC provides researchers, teachers and industrial
              users a sample of any member of the collection; in the most recent year, over
              13,000 such samples were provided.  Periodically, the ATCC also publishes
              information about of the collection, including names and properties of the
              strains, as well as limited information of use in culturing the organisms. 
              Such information is also made available through electronic media such as the
              Internet.  ***
