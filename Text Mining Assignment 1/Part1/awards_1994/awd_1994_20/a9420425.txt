Abstract    :
              9420425  Callcott  The Principal investigators will utilize the extended energy
              range  at  the  Center for Advanced Microstructure Devices and the Advanced
              Light  Sources  at  Lawrence  Berkeley Laboratory  to  study  technologically 
              important  materials such as high temperature superconductors,  multi-  layer 
              magnetic materials, and high temperature materials.  They  will  study  bonding
              of impurities in semiconductors, low abundance elements  in  biological 
              materials,  and of molecules  and  surface  layers  on  surfaces.  The 
              research will lead to a deeper and  more  quantitative  understanding  of
              soft-x-ray fluorescence in various  materials.  This  will  lead  to  a unique
              instrumentation which will be used  to  study  surfaces,   catalysis,  
              interfaces  and   magnetic   dichroism.   The  instruments   will  provide 
              unique  capabilities  for  students   and  scientists from national, industrial
              and university laboratories.  %%%    The Principal investigators will utilize
