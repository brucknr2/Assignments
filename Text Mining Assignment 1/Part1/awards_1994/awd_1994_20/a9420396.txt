Abstract    :
              This project is creating an experimental system using the Internet  that will
              allow students in design courses to use rapid prototyping  services.  Three
              participant institutions, Carnegie-Mellon  University, the University of
              California at Berkeley, and Stanford  University are participating in the
              project.  Each has developed  individual technologies for virtual and physical
              prototyping, which  currently stand alone.  Bringing these technologies
              together will  result in exciting new capabilities.  Partnerships with
              industrial  partners and a Federal laboratory are also anticipated.  This 
              project addresses key issues in prototyping, and is creating a  network of
              interconnected services to support the rapid design,  test, and manufacture of
              mechanical, electro-mechanical, and  electronic products.
