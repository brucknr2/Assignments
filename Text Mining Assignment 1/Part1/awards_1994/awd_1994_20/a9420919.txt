Abstract    :
              Bradshaw  9420919  A Symposium on Mechanisms of Regulated  Intracellular Protein
               Degradation will be held under the auspices of the American  Society for
              Biochemistry and Molecular Biology  (ASBMB) on  October 14 -17, 1994, in
              Whistler, British Columbia, CANADA.  Participation will be 200 to 250
              scientists (including speakers  and moderators), selected on the basis of their
              expertise and  interest in this area, and their expected contribution to the 
              success of this scientific program. Intracellular protein  degradation in
              eukaryotes is clearly a complex process involving  multiple systems and 
              pathways. In part, this reflects the  various types of turnover that must be
              effected by cells. Some  mechanisms are clearly highly regulated and involve
              the turnover  of the specific proteins and enzymes in a carefully programmed 
              fashion, whereas other mechanisms respond more generally to  classes of
              proteins such as internalized ligands or incorrectly  folded or damaged
              proteins. As compared, for example, to  synthetic processes, relatively little
              is known about either the  proteases involved or the signals that identify
              their prospective  substrates. This meeting will focus on the elements in
              protein  structure that are thought to play key roles in the regulation of 
              both general and programmed protein turnover and the proteases  that are likely
              to be involved. The presentations and discussions  will range from evaluations
              of the structure and functional   relationships of individual components to
              physiologically  relevant responses that are known to involve  programmed 
              turnover. Recent advances from a variety of laboratories indicate  that this is
              a particularly good time for an analysis of our  current understanding of
              protein degradation signals and  mechanisms and to evaluate future directions. 
               %%%  This meeting on Mechanisms of  Regulated Intracellular Protein 
              Degradation will serve as a catalyst for stimulating the interest  of
              scientists who may already have the tools in hand to approach   these problems
              with a focus on those young scientists who are yet  to initiate a major area of
              independent research.  ***
