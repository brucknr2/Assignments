Abstract    :
              This project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, will
              continue  Professor Marcus' research into the fundamental and practical aspects
              of the application of  radio frequency glow discharge (rf-GD) devices for the
              elemental analysis of solids by  atomic absorption, atomic emission, and mass
              spectrometries.  The primary focus of the  research will involve the
              development of new methods for the analysis of nonconducting  solids, such as
              oxides, depth-profiling of solid materials, methods for the analysis of polymer
               films, and the development of glow discharge sources for the generation of
              metal ions for  chemical ionization mass spectrometry.    This research,
              supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, will increase our 
              understanding of the fundamental aspects glow discharge devices and their
              application as  sputtering devices and metal ion generators for use with atomic
              and mass spectrometries for  the analysis of solid materials.
