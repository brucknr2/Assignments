Abstract    :
              9420597  Pfeffer    ABSTRACT    A concentration of courses in Particulate
              Technology is proposed.  It will consist of three courses:    {SYMBOL 183 \f
              "Symbol" \s 13 \h} Introduction of Particle Technology:  Fundamentals and
              Applications    {SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 13 \h} Current Research in Particle
              Technology    {SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 13 \h} Experiments and Simulations in
              Particulate Flows.     The courses will be based on the recent research of the
              PIs and their colleagues in the particle technology research community.  The
              collective work of the PIs come from a wide range of areas such as discrete
              element modeling, experimental studies of dry bulk solids, N-body hydrodynamics
              and sedimentation, dust filtration, theoretical studies in solid-liquid flows,
              agglomeration and granulation in fluidized beds, pattern recognition and
              cluster analysis, image analysis, and design of mechanical experiments.  Most
              of the research results are relatively recent and cannot be found in
              text-books.  The objective of this proposal is to incorporate these results
              into the engineering curriculum.  ***
