Abstract    :
              9420205  Ngo       In order to understand how Monolithic Magnetics operates and 
              how it is used, a physics-based modeling methodology will be  developed for the
              large-signal analysis and simulation of both  field-related and terminal
              characteristics of Monolithic  Magnetics - while the device functions in a
              switched-mode power  converter.  (The modeling methodology can also be used to 
              implement large-signal models for conventional magnetics in  standard circuit
              simulators.)  A design methodology and a   library of standard cells will be
              established to facilitate  Monolithic Magnetic design.  Switched-mode dc-to-dc
              converters  employing Monolithic Magnetics will be fabricated and tested to 
              verify the theory and to assess the usefulness of Monolithic  Magnetics.  ***
