Abstract    :
              9420628  Boriakoff    Dr. Boriakoff and his colleague, Dr. T.V. Smirnova, will
              pursue a proof-of-  concept investigation of a new observational technique for
              measuring the  interstellar magnetic field.  The field is measured in the
              direction of pulsars,  and the advantage of this new technique over the
              traditional method of  measuring Rotation Measure are much higher accuracy and
              the absence of  need of calibration of the antenna system.
