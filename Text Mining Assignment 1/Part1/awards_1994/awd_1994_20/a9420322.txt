Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic  Chemistry Program
              supports research by Dr. David N. Hendrickson  of the Chemistry Department,
              University of California at San  Diego, on electronic effects in
              metal-containing solids.   Detailed studies will be carried out on transition
              metal  complexes that have two or more electronic states which are close  in
              energy.  For compounds in which vibrational modes are closely  coupled with
              electronic modes, changes in crystal lattice  parameters such as those caused
              by modifying solvent or  counterions can result in spin-crossover or phase
              transitions in  response to changes in light or other external parameters.  The
               primary goal of this project is to verify and characterize  magnetic
              bistability in a molecular species, specifically a  dodecanuclear manganese
              compound.  Investigation of optically  sensitive iron complexes and
              electronically sensitive cobalt  complexes will also continue.    The long-term
              goal of this research is to develop molecules or  collections of molecules for
              use in electronic circuits and  devices.  Nanoscale devices which change spin,
              number of  electrons, or magnetic properties in response to electric, 
              magnetic, optical, or thermal changes may be useful for switches  or
              information storage.  In this research, compounds containing a  small number of
              metal atoms will be tested for sensitivity and  specificity of response to
              external physical stimuli.  Only a few  examples of molecules in which the
              magnetic field changes in  response to changes in external magnetic field are
              known, so this  research may open a new area of investigation.
