Abstract    :
              9420469  Kadonaga  The third FASEB Summer Research Conference on "Chromatin and
              Transcription" will be held on June 24-29, 1995 at the Conference Center in
              Snowmass Village, Colorado.  A primary objective of this meeting is to bring
              together researchers who study transcription factors, chromatin structure, and
              higher-order nuclear organization.  The prevalent theme of this meeting is the
              role of eukaryotic chromosome structure in the function of basic cellular
              processes.  While the analysis of chromatin and transcription is the central
              topic of this meeting, the function of chromatin/nuclear structure extends
              beyond this domain.  For instance, chromatin assembly is a key step in the cell
              cycle, and for this reason, we have included a session on DNA replication and
              chromatin assembly.  There also appears to be a relation between nuclear
              structure/localization and gene expression, and these topics are represented by
              sessions on locus control regions and boundary elements, heterochromatin and
              position-effect variegation, and nuclear organixation.  The timing of the 1995
              conference is ideal for the presentation and discussion of data in these
              rapidly evolving areas.  %%%  The third FASEB Summer Research Conference on
