              curriculum structure for a new interdisciplinary manufacturing degree, focusing
              on the product realization process.  Proposed for funding are (1) detailed
              specification of degree program; (2) new course development; (3) team oriented
              praticum; (4) new high tech classroom; (5) product and process rapid
              phototyping lab; (6) manufacturing control systems lab; and (7) program
              start-up administration.   ***
