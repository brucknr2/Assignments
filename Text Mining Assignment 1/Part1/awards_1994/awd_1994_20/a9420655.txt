Abstract    :
                                                               With funding from the Organic
              Dynamics Program, Professor DeRosa of Penn. State-Delaware  County Campus will
              characterize seminal compounds in the 2-aminopyrrole class of compounds.   This
              will include both chemical and physical characterization as well as reaction
              profiles.  From  this work, it is anticipated that the electronic effect of the
              2-amino substituent will be clearly  established.  Further, tautomeric isomers
              and roles of hydrogen exchange will be determined.    Pyrrole is a fundamental
              building block in biological systems and its chemical reactions are quite 
              significant.  This project will elaborate the effects that substituents have on
              the chemistry of this  important class of compounds.  This research is also
              designed to have a major impact on  undergraduate students which reflects on
              the future scientific enterprise.
