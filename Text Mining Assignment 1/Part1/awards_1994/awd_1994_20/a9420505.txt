Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT      9503226  Giovanelli, Riccardo      Dr. Giovanelli will carry out a
              program of spectroscopic and photometric observations that will   refine our
              understanding of the distribution of light and dark matter in the Universe,
              provide a   reference frame in the determination of large scale deviations from
              Hubble flow, and improve   the dynamical definition of nearby to intermediate
              redshift clusters of galaxies.  The results   should also clarify the current
              limitations of the redshift-independent methods of measuring   extragalactic
              distances.     ***
