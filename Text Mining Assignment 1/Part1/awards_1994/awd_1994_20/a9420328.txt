Abstract    :
              9420328  Lacy      The motility of sperm is an extremely important factor in
              determining successful fertilization in livestock, game animals, and man. 
              Numerous drugs have been used to increase sperm motility but each has a major
              drawback which includes damage to genetic material, producing defects in the
              embryo, and instability of the drugs.  Dr. Lacy's laboratory has discovered a
              reproductive gland (alkaline gland) in a cartilagenous fish (the stingray)
              which produces a fluid that accelerates sperm motility not only in stingrays
              but also in other fish (bass), bull, and man.  Experiments in Dr. Lacy's
              laboratory further showed that the substance in this fluid which stimulates
              sperm motility appears to be protein in nature.  Antibodies to one particular
              protein, the hormone relaxin, showed that it is likely to be present in this
              fluid and may be the causative molecule for increased sperm motility.  The
              objective of the current grant application is to determine the mode of action
              and physiological significance of alkaline gland fluid protein with attention
              paid to relaxin.  Studies will focus on three specific aims:  1) to isolate and
              purify the sperm stimulating protein(s); 2) to isolate and identify the
              molecules on the sperm surface which specifically bind the alkaline gland fluid
              protein(s); and 3) to determine if stingray relaxin has other effects such as
              contraction of female uterine smooth muscle which would also aid fertilization.
               The significance of this study's results will be to elucidate some of the
              mechanisms for successful fertilization in these fish.  ***
