Abstract    :
              9420832  MOLLER  The University-National Laboratory System (UNOLS) fleet of
              research  vessels, operated by academic institutions, provides support 
              services to those NSF sponsored researchers who require time at sea  to
              complete their investigations.  All of these ships use  oceanographic cable as
              part of this research support.  Arrangements  have been made which allow bulk
              purchases of wire rope resulting in  considerable cost savings.    Sisteen
              reels of cable will be purchased.  The cable is stored  until needed at the
              Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) on  the east coast and at the
              Scripps Institution of Oceanography on  the west coast.    Mr. Donald A.
              Moller, Marine Operations Coordinator, WHOI, will  manage this project.  ***
