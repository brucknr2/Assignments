Abstract    :
              9420961  Celik-Bulter  The purpose of the proposed work is to develop a
              low-cost, simple room temperature infrared detection technology using YBa2Cu3O6
              thin films in a bolometer structure that can be directly integrated to the
              silicon signal processing circuitry.  The material to be investigated is
              YBa2Cu3Ox, well known for its superconductive properties at cryogenic
              temperatures (x=7).  YBa2Cu3O6(x=6) is a low conductivity semiconductor at
              300K.  YBa2Cu3Ox is a ferroelectric (Er=105-106) and has intrinsically low
              noise when compared to competing materials like HgCdTe and amorphous silicon. 
              The oxygen content of the YBa2Cu3)6 thin film can be precisely adjusted to
              obtain the desired conductivity and dielectric constant.  The proposed
              investigation is the first ever attempt, to exploit the nonsuperconducting
              phase of YBa2Cu3O6.  We believe YBa2Cu3O6 is going to surpass all existing
              uncooled IR technologies if a full investigation is done.  ***
