Abstract    :
              9420615  Sakita       This proposal "Problems in Strong and Weak Interactions" 
              deals with attempts to define a consistent superstring theory  which
              incorporates in one framework quantum versions of all know  interactions
              including gravity.  It also books for links between  these field theoretical
              models of strong interactions and certain  properties of electrons moving in
              two dimensions under the  influence of a magnetic field.      ***
