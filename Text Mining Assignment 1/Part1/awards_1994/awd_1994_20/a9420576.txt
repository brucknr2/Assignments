Abstract    :
              9420576  Kim    ABSTRACT     The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is
              proposing an interdisciplinary combined research-curriculum development project
              to develop methodologies for achieving effective collaboration and integration
              of industrial design and product engineering in the early phases of product
              development, and to develop integrated engineering and industrial design
              curriculum where industrial design and engineering students will learn the
              integration methodologies and conduct interdisciplinary product design
              projects.   The project team led by three principal investigators representing
              industrial design, engineering design and manufacturing engineering has been
              developing design support tools appropriate to improve combined evaluations
              from industrial designers concerns and engineering and manufacturing
              considerations.  Specifically, four major tool development efforts will be made
              for (1) design history documenting system, (2) associative, shape design tools,
              (3) design for manufacture comparative cost models and design-to cost tools and
              (4) designer-friendly interface for rapid prototyping tools.   Based on newly
              developed design methodologies and tools for integrated engineering and
              industrial design, fully collaborated, innovative curriculum, composed of two
              core courses, will be developed in a tightly integrated design studio and
              prototyping laboratory.  Emphasis will be on the integrated design methods and
              tools in the first semester course, and on interdisciplinary team-based design
              projects sponsored by industry in the second semester course.  ***
