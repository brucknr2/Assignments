Abstract    :
              9420843  Griffin  This project describes a molecular engineering approach to a 
              new class of materials with remarkable properties.  Negative  Poisson's ratio
              materials  (also known as auxetic materials)  expand laterally when stretched. 
              This is at variance with  usual expectation since virtually everything thins
              when  stretched - a rubber band for example.  Although  theoretically possible
              there are virtually no known examples  of auxetic materials.  It has however
              been recently  discovered that special geometric features are capable of 
              imparting this behavior and large scale macroscopic  structures can be built to
              accomplish this.  Also, special  fabrication techniques can sometimes produce
              this effect by  inducing unusual morphologies in certain polymeric  materials. 
              The Poisson's ratio is a fundamental elastic  constant of a material and is
              interconnected to the other  elastic constants which govern mechanical
              response.  Tailoring the Poisson's ratio offers the possibility of  precise
              control of mechanical performance.  It has been  recognized that ultimate
              control of such behavior lies in a  molecularly designed auxetic material which
              will permit  careful tailoring of this bahavior and which will give the 
              maximum auxetic response.  This proposal describes the  design, the synthetic
              approach and the characterization of  two polymeric classes each of which
              reflects at the  molecular level the geometric features known to be 
              mechanistically operative in producing an auxetic response  at the macroscopic
              level.    %%%    A variety of extraordinary applications can follow:  fasteners
              and rivets which will get fatter (tighter fit)  upon attempted removal and
              gaskets and seals which will seat  better (contraction) when under compression
              loading.  Composites are also envisioned in which an auxetic fiber  will reduce
              or eliminate fiber pull-out, one of the critical  problems in composite
              science.    ***
