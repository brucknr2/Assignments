Abstract    :
              9420431  Akay    ABSTRACT     The proposed curriculum development program will
              transfer new research results to undergraduate engineering students at Carnegie
              Mellon University in the context of new discovery-oriented Open Laboratories
              and Design-Form-Research projects.  Students at the Freshmen through Senior
              levels will learn about, use, and further develop theoretical and experimental
              findings from a team of established researchers.  Technical results will be
              drawn from research programs, institutes, and centers at Carnegie Mellon,
              including the Engineering Design Research Center, the Data Storage Systems
              Center, the Robotics Institute, and the Environmental Institute.  ***
