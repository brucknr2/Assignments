Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT      9420018  Readhead, A.C.S.    There are two major scientific foci
              of this research program directed by Dr. Anthony Readhead at Cal Tech: The
              first is the study of the astrophysics of active galaxies and unified theories
              of active galaxies.  The second is the study of cosmology, particularly
              measurements of the Hubble constant and the deceleration parameter.  The
              successful execution of these programs will depend upon skillful exploitation
              of the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). Much of the research program depends
              upon software developed by this group with close attention to the scientific
              drivers.    ***
