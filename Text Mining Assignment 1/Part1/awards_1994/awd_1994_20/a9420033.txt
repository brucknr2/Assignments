              ecosystems harbor unusual and largely un-described biotic communities.
              Groundwater ecosystems in hydrothermal regions or in areas where reduced sulfur
              is present can receive energy in the form of hydrogen sulfide. Ecosystems based
              around energy from chemical sources (e.g. hydrogen sulfide, methane, ammonium,
              manganese, iron) were found at hydrothermal vents in the deep oceans in 1977,
              and a groundwater ecosystem with similar possible sources of energy was
              recently found in Romania. A comprehensive analysis of this ecosystem and the
              microbial and invertebrate communities is to be studied by this project.   
              This research is important for four reasons. First, this reasonably accessible
              cave ecosystem in Romania provides the chance to test if chemosynthesis, rather
              than photosynthesis, produces the organic matter which feeds the organisms in
              this ecosystem as it does in marine hydrothermal vent communities. Second, the
              cave is home to a large number of endemic organisms previously unknown to
              science which can be more thoroughly characterized and described. Third, the
              project strengthens a strong collaboration between U.S. and Romanian
              scientists. Fourth, the mechanism of producing organic matter from the
              oxidation of sulfide creates sulfuric acid as a byproduct. This process may
              well explain the method by which rapid formation of large caves can occur such
              as is found at Carlsbad and Lechuguilla Caverns in the southwestern United
              States.                                                   X   x
