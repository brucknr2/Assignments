Abstract    :
              9420641  This analysis of the dynamics of a stable atmospheric  boundary layer
              is based on a history of antarctic katabatic  wind studies and the principal
              investigator's work on  boundary layer dynamics at South Pole Station.   
              Several hypotheses have been advanced to explain a number of  consistently
              observed features of katabatic winds.  These  include cold drainage flows
              driven by radiative cooling,  warm surface temperatures, and downward mixing of
              cold air  without depleting the negative buoyancy driving the flow.  These
              hypotheses, reasonable when considered individually,  have not been proven
              quantitatively in an integrated manner.    This study will use high resolution
              models to simulate these  flows in realistic topography, using conditions
              derived from  the fairly extensive number of analytical studies that  currently
              exist in the published literature.  A regional  hydrostatic model containing a
              high resolution boundary  layer will be used to study relationships among the 
              occurrence and strength of these events, the synoptic  setting, regional
              radiative cooling rates, and regional  geomorphological characteristics.  A
              very high resolution  compressible model will be applied to a single valley to 
              simulate details of the flow's evolution, interaction with  topography, and
              exchange of energy within the atmosphere and  with the underlying surface.  ***
