Abstract    :
              9420356  Calvert       The research is for development of a solid freeform 
              fabrication system based on extrusion of a fine jet of  polymerizable slurry. 
              Three-dimensional parts are build up as a  series of layers under computer
              control, based on part geometry  data stored in the computer.  Preliminary
              results have been  obtained in conjunction with a local small business.  The 
              researched work will use two joined heads so that two-component  reagents can
              be used, allowing parts to be formed from a wide range  of strong polymers and
              from organic/inorganic hybrids by  coextrusion of alkoxide/monomer mixtures and
              water/monomer  mixtures.  It will also allow composite materials to be formed
              with  compositional gradients, or with short-fiber reinforced composites,  such
              that mechanical properties can be locally optimized.   Reinforced composites
              will be designed using finite element methods  to seek optimal distributions of
              reinforcements.       Rapid prototyping to near net shape offers numerous
              advantages  in terms of reducing cycle time, waste, and thus manufacturing 
              costs.  The ability to make complex composites should open the way  to
              biomimetic and intelligent materials which can achieve levels of  damage
              resistance and responsiveness found in biological materials.
