Abstract    :
              AST 9420645                                                            ABSTRACT 
                                              This project will design, build, and install a
              versatile and  efficient Medium Resolution Spectrograph (MRS) for the 9-m 
              Hobby-Eberly telescope (HET).  This instrument will cover  the entire visible
              spectrum from 350 to 1100 nm (with a  clear upgrade path for use at 1800 nm),
              have a resolution  range from 3000 < lambda/ delta-lambda < 18000, and reside 
              in an environmentally controlled spectrograph room.  Optical  fibers will
              couple the spectrograph to the telescope;  operating modes for the instrument
              will include single  object, synthetic long slit, and multiple object 
              spectroscopy.  Because of the need for both spectral  coverage and resolution,
              the MRS will be a dual beam system  (split at 590 nm), with a grating
              cross-dispersed echelle,  and a white-pupil that controls vignetting losses
              while  keeping the sizes of costly optical elements small.  This  configuration
              is both economical and highly efficient.    The MRS will be designed to take
              maximum advantage of the  high efficiency optics and queue scheduled nature of
              the  HET.  Among its many programs, the MRS will 1) explore the  broad line
              regions of active galactic nuclei and quasars  through dense time sample
              spectroscopy, 2) examine the  evolution of large scale structure in the
              universe through  measurements of quasar absorption lines, 3) detect and 
              characterize the properties of dark matter via kinematical  measurements in
              elliptical galaxies, and 4) measure the age  and dynamical evolution of the
              Milky Way through kinematical  study of white dwarfs,.
