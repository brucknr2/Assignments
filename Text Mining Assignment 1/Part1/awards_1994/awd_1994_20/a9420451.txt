Abstract    :
              9420451  Russell    ABSTRACT     The purpose of the proposed project is to
              integrate the basic concepts and applications of scanned probe microscopy (SPM)
              into the undergraduate and entry level graduate engineering curriculum by
              developing lectures, laboratories, computer modules, and video-based
              instructional materials.  Scanned probe microscopy (SPM) has grown, in little
              more than a decade, from an instrument used only by surface scientists into a
              broad family of microscopical and microanalytical techniques that are
              increasingly employed for engineering applications.  The rapid development of
              this new technology has outpaced the supply of engineers having the appropriate
              training in the fundamental aspects of scanned probe microscopy, as well as the
              details of engineering applications.  The proposed project will integrate these
              concepts and skills into the educational program of a significant number of
              engineers, so as to fill the present need, as well as facilitate advances in
              technology that may result from taking advantage of SPM's unique capabilities.
