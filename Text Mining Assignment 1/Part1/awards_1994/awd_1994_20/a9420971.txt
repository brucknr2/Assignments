Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the use of Ti(IV) complexes containing  
              Schiff-base tridentate ligands to carry out enantioselective aldol   additions.
                Ligands  will be based upon   2-amino-2'-hydroxy-1,1'-binapthyl and
              2,2'-diaminobinapthyl  scaffolds   upon  which the the counterion and nature of
              the salicylimine are varied.     Enantioselective aldol addition reactions of
              acetate, propionate,   crotonate and ketone derived silyl enol ethers will be
              explored.  The   catalytic methodology will lead to the production of 
              optically active   beta-hydroxy esters and delta-hydroxy-alpha,
              beta-unsaturated esters.    With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is
              supporting the research   of Dr. Erick M. Carreira of the Department of
              Chemistry at the Califonia   Institute of Technology.  Professor Carreira will
              focus his work on the   development of catalytic methodology for the the
              formation of   carbon-carbon bonds.  The optically active products are useful  
              intermediates for the preparation of stereochemically complex systems   that
              have important biological properties.
