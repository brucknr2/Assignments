Abstract    :
              This project is to hold a conference on December 15-16 in Cambridge,
              Massachusetts, to reconcile the diverse results concerning the effect of school
              quality on student achievement and employment earnings.  This literature forms
              a major component of the work on Human Capital, which SBER has launched a major
              research initiative. The conference will invite papers which attempt to
              replicate prior results using the same data set, but different investigators;
              which estimate the same model on different data sets; which estimate previous
              used models on new data sets not used heretofor; and which generally aim to
              reconcile the past collection of conflicting results.  The sharing of data sets
              will be an important feature of the papers presented at this conference.  The
              leading empirical journal in economics, The Review of Economics and Statistics,
              has agreed to devote an issue on the conference papers.  This project has the
              potential of encouraging other journals to publish replications of previously
              published studies and of encouraging economists to share their data and
              replicate each other's work.
