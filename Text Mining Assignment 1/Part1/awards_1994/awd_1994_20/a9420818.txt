Abstract    :
              9420818  Siniff  The Weddell seal is an important upper trophic level species
              that   has been the focus of long-term studies because of its proximity  to
              Antarctic support facilities.  The most extensive  investigations have involved
              the Weddell seal population at  McMurdo Station where research and monitoring
              efforts began in the  early 1960s and have continued since that date.  The
              objectives of  this project are 1) to continue the long-term tagging studies by
               completing the field work necessary to tag all pups born into the  McMurdo
              sound population and to replace tags on previously tagged  individuals so they
              will not be lost from the tagged population  and 2) to update estimates of
              population parameters annually and  to continue the analyses and test of
              hypotheses associated with  this data base.  In support of these analyses we
              will carry out  mark-recapture surveys that are necessary to obtain all the 
              estimates required for current capture-recapture models.
