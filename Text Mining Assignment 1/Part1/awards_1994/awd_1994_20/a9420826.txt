Abstract    :
              This award is made in the Organic Dynamics Program in support of the   research
              of Dr. Charles Doubleday.  Both computational and time-resolved   experimental
              studies of the dynamics of bimolecular reactions which have   low or zero
              enthalpies will be carried out.  Specific computational   studies will  focus
              on reactions of singlet ethylene and methylene with   ethylene, water and
              ammonia, as well as the competition between   combination and 
              disproportionation in the reaction of methyl and ethyl   free radicals. Ab
              initio calculations of reaction potential curves will   be combined with
              variational transition state theory to derive reaction   rate constants.
              Experimentally, picosecond pump-probe spectroscopy of   intramolecular
              entropy-controlled reactions of biradicals will be   explored. The dependence
              of the transient decay trace on temperature and   solvent viscosity will be
              determined.  Entropy-controlled bimolecular reactions such as carbene trapping
              ,   reaction of ylides with olefins, singlet oxygen trapping, radical  
              recombination, cycloadditions and excited-state quenching are common in  
              organic chemistry. This research will advance our understanding, both on   a
              theoretical and experimental level of the dynamics of these important  
              processes.
