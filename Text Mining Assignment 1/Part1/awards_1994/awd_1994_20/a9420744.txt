Abstract    :
              94240744  Lanou  The proposed research consists of a series of experiments to 
              study the use of superfluid helium as a detector of both non-  ionizing and
              ionizing radiation.  The goal of the research is the  development of the
              technology for a new type of particle detector  useful for several important
              experiments in neutrino physics and  astrophysics.  This superfluid
              helium-based detector would have  the ability to measure the energy and
              location of a particle  event as well as, possibly track direction.  Such a
              detector  would be unique in being able to detect 20 keV particles in a 10  ton
              mass of liquid helium.  Superfluid helium is well suited as a  target material
              for detecting low-energy particles in a very  large mass.  It is extremely
              pure, it is inexpensive, and it can  be easily handled in bulk.  Specialized
              equipment already constructed to investigate the use  of helium as particle
              detector will be employed in the proposed  research.  Only minor modifications
              to an existing cryogenic  system and modest additions to the electronics are
              required.  Work on improving cryogenic bolometers is to be performed in 
              conjunction with groups in Munich and Heidelberg who are  interested in the
              same technical problems but have different  research goals.  The group at Brown
              carrying out these experiments is an unique  collaboration among particle,
              condensed matter, and low  temperature experimentalists.  The proposed
              experimental program,  if successful, will provide the technology to make
              possible  frontier experiments in neutrino and astrophysics.  ***
