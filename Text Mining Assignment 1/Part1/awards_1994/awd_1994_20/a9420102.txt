Abstract    :
              9420102  Abele  Many questions about phylogeny or relationships remain
              unresolved for the large arthropod invertebrate group Crustacea despite years
              of study of the morphology of both living and well-preserved fossil taxa.  A
              molecular phylogenetic approach using sequencing of 18S rDNA has resolved
              questions for some groups and this award will support continued DNA sequencing
              work toward developing a phylogeny or pattern of relationship for all major
              crustacean groups.  The molecular phylogeny will then be used to address
              questions of morphological change in crustacean lineages, including whether
              certain suites of characters are correlated and have changed together as
              functional units.  %%%  Knowledge of phylogenetic relationships in this very
              diverse group of invertebrate organisms will contribute to our understanding of
              invertebrate biodiversity.  Crustacea are especially important ecologically as
              they fill several roles.  In both fresh water and marine systems minute
              crustacea are a major component of foodwebs.  Larger crustacea include our own
              food resources of lobsters, shrimp, and their relatives.  And barnacles are a
              negatively economically important group causing major shipping and recreational
              maintenance costs each year.  ***
