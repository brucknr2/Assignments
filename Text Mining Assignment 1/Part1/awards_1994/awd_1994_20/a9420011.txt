Abstract    :
              9420011  Saltzman       Describing, analyzing and predicting the state of the 
              atmospheric dynamical system are all tasks which require  dealing with a wide
              range of scales in both space and time.  The proposed collaboration would
              develop new tools and  concepts for these tasks, by building on the growing
              body of  theoretical understanding and practical application of  localized
              multiscale decomposition realized by wavelet  representations.  Specifically, a
              plan is proposed to  investigate at least three problems of dynamical 
              meteorology: (1) computing the evolution of dynamical  partial differential
              equations such as the vorticity  equation; (2) analyzing remotely-sensed and
              other  meteorological data sets to obtain values of fields such as  wind
              velocity, water vapor and cloudiness; (3) applying (1)  and (2) to a model
              computation and an observational study of  atmospheric energetics.  These
              problems will also provide a  test of recent theoretical results concerning
              efficiency  properties of wavelet representations, and encourage  development
              of new mathematical techniques and concepts to  address intermediate problems
              as they arise.
