Abstract    :
              IBN-9420249  Russell Jacobs    This is a collaborative effort by biologists,
              chemists and computer  scientists to collect images of the developing brains of
              small  animals by developing high-resolution magnetic imaging (MRI)  techniques
              which allow brain imaging in living developing animals.  From these images
              atlases of the developing brains of the quail,  mouse, and marmoset will be
              generated. These atlases will then be  used for tracking the development of
              major neuronal pathways in the  nervous system as a function of developmental
              age in these three  species. To do this tracking, the researchers will develop
              special  MR contrast agents that will mark individual nerve cells so that  the
              evolution of individual cells within the intact nervous system  can be
              observed. Detailed in vivo analyses of developing nervous  systems are
              relatively rare and are of great scientific interest  from an embryological and
              phylogenetic perspective. This Award  represents a part of the NSF BIO
              Directorate's participation in and  contribution to the FICC-Human Brain
              Project.
