                                       The National Academy of Sciences, through the Ocean
              Studies  Board of the Commission on Geosciences, Environment, and  Resources,
              will convene a colloquium on carbon dioxide and  climate change to document the
              present state of research and  knowledge in this field. This colloquium will be
              held in  honor of the late Professor Roger Revelle, a pioneer in  assessing
              anthropogenic effects in the global carbon cycle.  This colloquium will be
              jointly supported by the NAS, DOE,  NOAA, NASA and ONR along with NSF.
