Abstract    :
              This award supports a study to use biological indicators,  namely fossil records
              of cryptoendolithic microbial  colonization of Beacon sandstone and
              microorganisms in  permafrost, to reconstruct paleoclimate history of the Late 
              Plio-Pleistocene period in the McMurdo Dry Valleys.  The  work will attempt to
              address the stabilist versus the  dynamicist view of the Antarctic ice sheet
              using past and  present occurences of distributions of climatically  sensitive
              living and fossilized biological indicators in the  Dry Valleys region. 
              Specifically, soil derived from Beacon  Sandstone and permafrost cores will be
              analyzed for the  occurence of living and fossilized microbial groups whose 
              viability zones are already known or will be determined by  mapping the
              distribution of present occurences.  This  information will be integrated with
              the distribution of  characteristic exfoliation patterns (recent and fossil) 
              caused by microbial activity to reconstruct relative age  sequences.  The
              sedimentology of the permafrost cores will  be characterized and integrated
              with microbiological and  chronostratigraphic data.  Absolute chronologies will
              be  provided (where appropriate) by carbon-14, thermoluminesence  dating and
              analysis of cosmogenic radionuclides.
