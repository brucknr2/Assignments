Abstract    :
              9420386 Bradley  The processing of zirconium diboride/copper composite parts by
              Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) is being investigated.  Zirconium diboride
              powders with a thin polymer coating are processed using selective laser
              sintering of the zirconium diboride powders followed by burn out of the polymer
              binder in a later annealing step.  Infiltration of copper produces the desired
              composite.  Evaluation of the zirconium diboride/copper composites considers
              (1) the dimensional precision; (2) the surface finish; and (3) the performance
              (in the form of electrical discharge machining electrodes by studying the sink
              rate and wear ratio of the electrode as well as the surface finish of the
              cavity produced).  Comparisons of the  performance of the SLS fabricated
              electrodes will be made with electrodes created using conventional machining. 
              Observations of behavior during processing will be made after each step using
              scanning electron microscopy to guide the development of physically based
              models that predict dimensional changes and surface roughness.  Once a workable
              process has been developed, three dimensional electrodes will be fabricated and
              evaluated in an electrical discharge machine.   %%% Zirconium diboride
              powder/copper composites are superb materials for electrical discharge
              machining electrodes, but are so difficult to machine that they are never used.
               Rapid prototyping of zirconium diboride powder/copper composites by selective
              laser sintering will allow fabrication of these composites.  Such composites
              will have significant performance advantages over graphite and copper
              electrodes. ***
