Abstract    :
              9420672  Lee    This award provides partial support for the acquisition of a 
              superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer  (specifically
              a Quantum Design MPMS-7).  This inqtrument will  greatly enhance the ongoing
              work of several research groups  probing the magnetic response of advanced
              materials and novel  solid-state structures at moderate to low temperatures. 
              These  research projects focus on the thorough characterization of  advanced
              metallic and non-metallic materials which display both  uncorrelated and
              ordered magnetic moments, and on the development  of magnetic order in small
              metallic clusters.  It is anticipated  that in many cases of interest the total
              mass of the sample will  be very small, making necessary the unparalleled high
              sensitivity  of a SQUID magnetometer.  %%%  Regular use of the magnetometer
              will be divided among five  principal investigators:  M. Lee, who will be the
              instrument  manager, S. J. Poon, B. Shivaram, L. Bloomfield all of the  Physics
              Department, and R. N. Grimes of the Chemistry Department.  In addition, a
              number of incidental users of the instrument from  physics, chemistry,
              materials science, and electrical enineering  are anticipated, since no
              comparable facility exists on thc UVa.  campus.  ***
