Abstract    :
              Abstract  CTS-9420780  J. L. Anderson, Carnegie-Melon University    An
              investigation of the electrophoretic motion of nonspherical colloidal particles
              is proposed.  The existence of a critical current needed to align slender
              particles at small pore apertures will be experimentally determined.  A
              hydrodynamic model, including the rotation and translation of spheroids and
              spherical doublets in nonhomogeneous electric fields will be develop.  The
              theory will be extended to motion of particles induced by a gradient of the
              particles concentration near a surface-active surface (diffusiophoresis of
              colloids.    The research has relevance to electrofiltration, and provides
              fundamental understanding for other potential applications where
              electrophoretic alignment is important.
