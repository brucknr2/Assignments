Abstract    :
              9420157  Saltzman          This project is part of the Southern Hemisphere
              Marine Aerosol Characterization Experiment (ACE-1),  which will be conducted in
              the remote Southern Pacific in 1995 using aircraft, ship-board, and
              ground-based  measurements of a wide variety of chemical species, physical  and
              meteorological parameters with the central  goal of investigating the
              formation, evolution, and optical properties of atmospheric aerosol. In this
              component,  atmospheric sulfur dioxide will be measured aboard the research
              vessel Discoverer and at Cape Grim,  Tasmania. The instruments to be used are
              HPLC-fluorescent devices which are capable of detecting 10 ppt  sulfur dioxide
              with a measurement period of less than 10 minutes. In addition to sulfur
              dioxide, filter-based  fluorescence decay measurements of hydrogen sulfide in
              air will be made on board the ship. Hydrogen sulfide is  a precursor to sulfur
              dioxide and no data are currently available from this region of the oceans.    
                 The goal of this project is to construct a budget for sulfur dioxide in the
              marine boundary layer over  the Southern Ocean, south of Tasmania.
              Specifically, the following quantities will be estimated: 1) the yield of 
              sulfur dioxide from the oxidation of dimethyl sulfide, 2) the photochemical
              loss rate to gas phase sulfuric acid,  and 3) the relative importance of losses
              to clouds, sea-salt aerosols and to the sea surface. The interpretation of  the
              field data will be done using a photochemical box model of the marine boundary
              layer coupled to a detailed  model of heterogeneous chemistry. Ultimately, this
              work will contribute to the development of mechanistic  models for the
              production and growth of sulfuric acid aerosols in marine air. Such models are
              clearly needed in  order to develop a predictive capability for the
              interrelation between global change and the aerosol/cloud  component of the
              earth s radiative budget.
