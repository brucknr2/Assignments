Abstract    :
              A Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge will be purchased for  use in
              multidisciplinary research in the Biochemistry and Chemistry  Departments at
              Louisiana State University. The ultracentrifuge will be  used to characterize
              peptides, rodlike synthetic polymers, proteins,  and nucleic acids. Molecular
              weights, aggregation states, and mutual  friction coefficients of these
              molecules will be determined. This  information will be used in studies of the
              mechanism of action of lytic  peptides, transport in semidilute solutions,
              protein structure and  stability, and DNA dynamics.
