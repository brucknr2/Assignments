Abstract    :
              9420307  Domach  This project is on research to  further develop a methodology
              for  in situ nuclear magnetic resonance  (NMR) spectroscopy to study  cellular
              metabolism.  The research  focuses on three areas: (1)  improving a cultivation
              system to  allow growth rate control and lower  cell densities in order to
              enhance  the signal to noise ratio, and thus  the NMR results; (2) enhancing
              the  overall system by incorporating on-  line pH, optical density, 
              fluorescent and dissolved oxygen  measurements; and (3) utilizing the  system
              to investigate polyphosphate  metabolism in yeast.  ***
