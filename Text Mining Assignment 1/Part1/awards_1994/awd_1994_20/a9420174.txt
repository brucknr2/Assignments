Abstract    :
              9420174  Fasman  Membrane proteins, such as receptors, ion channels, transport 
              channels, hormone receptors, etc. represent an important class of  proteins. 
              Understanding their structure would reveal important  aspects of their
              functional role.  However, crystallization of  membrane proteins has proven to
              be difficult and this has raised  major stumbling blocks to obtaining their
              three-dimensional  structure.  To date, the structures of only a few membrane
              proteins  have been determined by X-ray diffraction studies or by electron 
              microscopy.  The proposed studies are to further develop a new  approach for
              the crystallization of membrane proteins by making  them water soluble by
              conjugation to methoxypolyethylene glycol  (mPEG), a water soluble polymer. 
              These conjugates have already  been formed with two membrane proteins,
              bacteriorhodopsin and porin  and have been found capable of refolding to their
              native  structures.  Preliminary experiments have shown that one of these 
              conjugates, mPEG porin, can be crystallized, but the crystals are  as yet too
              small for X-ray diffraction studies.  Research is  proposed to further develop
              the method to a point where useful  crystals can be obtained routinely and to
              carry out X-ray  diffraction studies with one or more of these protein
              conjugates.  ***
