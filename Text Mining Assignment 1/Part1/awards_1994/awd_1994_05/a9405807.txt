Abstract    :
              9405807  Person       This award provides 43% of the funds required to  acquire
              a cluster of computer workstations to be installed  and used for research and
              teaching in the Department of  Geology and Geophysics at the University of
              Minnesota. The  University is committed to providing the remaining funds 
              needed for the acquisition.       Much of the research and graduate training
              within the  Department of Geology and Geophysics is focused on  quantitative
              studies of fluid circulation and fluid-rock  interactions within the Earth's
              crust as well as theoretical  investigations in mantle dynamics. The
              acquisition of a  cluster of networked computer workstations will permit 
              research and training on topics as diverse as mantle  convection, mantle
              rheology and melt migration, river  dynamics, sedimentation, subsurface brine
              migration,  sedimentary basin hydrodynamics, and paleolimnology.  ***
