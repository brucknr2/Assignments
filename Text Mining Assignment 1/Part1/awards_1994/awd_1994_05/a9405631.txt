Abstract    :
              9405631  Rojstaczer    This study proposes to extend work on the causes and
              timing of  temporal changes in permeability induced  by seismicity.  The 
              research is designed to obtain a more definitive understanding of  the coupling
              that exists between fault motion and hydrology.  Such  information provides
              constraints on the time dependence  of the  hydrology of the shallow crust. 
              The research also has application  to the storage of high level radioactive
              waste at Yucca Mountain  and to understanding the timing and location of major
              ore and  hydrocarbon deposits.  Finally, it may also provide prehistoric 
              information on the rupture cycle of the San Andreas Fault.    The project will
              examine: whether ground motion induced shear  stress is capable of generating
              increases in permeability near the  San Andreas fault; and whether  the
              influence of seismicity on  groundwater flow over geologic time can be seen in
              the rock record.   The field aspects of the research will focus on the San
              Lorenzo  drainage basin.  This basin accounted for 35% of the excess 
              streamflow produced by the Loma Prieta  earthquake (10/17/89, M  7.0) and has
              already been studied extensively by the PI.  Hydraulic  fracture tests will be
              performed in granodiorite on the edge of the  San Lorenzo drainage basin. The
              results from these tests will be  used in conjunction with models of
              ground-motion induced shear  stress to examine the constraints on ground motion
              induced  permeability enhancement. These constraints will be used to test 
              whether permeability enhancement can explain the spatial patterns  of
              earthquake-induced hydrologic change in the region.  Core will  be obtained
              from the granodiorite to a depth of 300 m for  petrologic analysis of the
              calcite cement which partially fills     fractures.   The influence of
              pre-historic faulting on subsurface  hydrology will be examined by analyzing
              the isotopic signature of  calcite fracture fills in the existing and newly
              obtained core.    The research will be done in cooperation wit h Stephen
              Hickman of  the U.S. Geological Survey who will provide all of the equipment 
              and manpower associated with the hydraulic fracturing tests.  Funds  for
              Stephen Hickman's portion  of the project will be provided by  the US.
