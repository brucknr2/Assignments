Abstract    :
              9405539  Oruc       A formidable problem in constructing high speed networks is 
              the control and routing of a heterogeneous mix and multirate of  signals.  in
              general, the speed of a network is determined by (a)  the clock rate at which
              its nodes operate, (b) the bandwidth of the  links between its nodes, (c) the
              amount of congestion at its nodes,  (d) the depth of the network, and (e) the
              time to compute the  routes between its nodes.  the first two of these factors
              are  technology dependent where clock rates are reaching a point of 
              saturation.  Assuming that, in a network of 10^9 nodes, each node  can process
              10^8 cycles/sec), even without any congestion, it would  take several seconds
              to send a packet between two nodes that are  separated by a distance
              proportional to the number of nodes in the  network.  Likewise, it would take
              seconds to send a packet between  two nodes on a network whose routing time is
              linear in the number  of its nodes.  Obviously, any congestion at the nodes in
              both cases  will aggravate the travel time of packets so that both the diameter
               (depth) and routing time of any high performance network with a  very large
              number of nodes ought to increase at less than a linear  rate with its number
              of nodes.  In constructing low cost,  congestion free (nonblocking) networks
              with logarithmic orders of  depths and routing times.  While some low-cost
              nonblocking networks  with logarithmic or polylogarithmic depths such as Clos,
              Cantor and  Bassalygo-Pinsker have been reported, these networks cannot be used
               for broadband networking unless they exhibit efficient and fast  routing
              schemes.  Moreover, in the case of latter two networks, it  is also open
              whether they can realize multicast and conference  assignments.  this project
              will attempt to resolve these problems  by using recursive network construction
              techniques, and parallel  and distributed computation methods.  ***
