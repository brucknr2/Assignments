Abstract    :
              9405443  Fisher  This project is to examine the abundances and isotopic 
              composition of Xe trapped from mantle sources by various  species of MORB, with
              particular attention paid to the  anomaly at mass 129, which has been by some
              workers but not  found by others.  In the work performed under the original 
              proposal a new mass spectrometer system was set up and  multiple aliquots of
              vesicles in two typical MORB were  crushed.  No mass-129 anomaly was seen.  In
              this proposal we  hope to extend that work to many more samples, to utilize 
              stepwise-heating in conjunction with the crushing  experiments, and to measure
              the isotopic and elemental  abundances of all the rare gases to better
              characterize the  results.
