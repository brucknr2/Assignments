Abstract    :
              Flavonols are required for successful fertilization in maize  and petunia. 
              Pollen lacking flavonols is unable to produce  a functional pollen tube, but
              this defect can be reversed  and pollen function "rescued" by the timely
              application of  kaempferol, a flavonol aglycone.  Biochemical  complementation
              of mature petunia pollen is achieved:  (1)  at pollination by wild type stigma
              exudate; (2) by adding  powdered kaempferol to the stigma or pollen at
              pollination;  and (3) by supplementing pollen with flavonol aglycones in 
              vitro.  The last method forms the basis of a sensitive  bioassay used to
              identify compounds that induce pollen  germination.  It also provides a model
              system for a focused  and systematic investigation of flavonol-stimulated
              pollen  germination.  This investigator proposes to combine  biochemical and
              molecular approaches to characterize  flavonol synthesis in developing anthers,
              the subsequent  metabolic fate of flavonols during pollen germination, and  the
              genes that respond to the flavonol stimulus.  This  information is crucial to
              understanding how small, planar  molecules stimulate pollen germination.  An
              understanding of  the factors regulating fertilization in higher plants is of 
              interest not only in terms of reproductive biology, but can  lead to the
              mechanisms to regulate fertility and fecundity.
