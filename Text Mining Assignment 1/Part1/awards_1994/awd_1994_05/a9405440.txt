Abstract    :
              9405440  Eisenberg  The subject of this award is the theoretical study of the 
              effects of ion-channel and ion-ion interactions involved in  diffusive ionic
              motion through biological channels.  The  model under consideration involves 
              (i) the joint diffusive  motion of an ion and a constrained dipole (or charged 
              oscillator) part of the channel wall with Coulombic  interactions, (ii) the
              mean field, inter-ionic interactions  at the entrance and exit to the channel
              and the mean field  interactions of the ion with the permanent charge inside
              the  pore, and (iii) the motion of an ion in the pore with  interaction with
              the mean field and with a constrained  dipole (or charged oscillator) part of
              the channel.  The  theoretical work will concentrate on modeling, analyzing, 
              and simulating the random motion described in these  conditions.  This award is
