Abstract    :
              With this award, the Chemistry Division is supporting a meeting organized by Dr.
              Donald T.  Sawyer of the Department of Chemistry at Texas A&M University.  The
              seventeen participants  will met in Los Angeles from January 13-14, 1994.  
              They will carry out an on-site review of  the first-year chemistry course at
              the California Institute of Technology, they will meet with the  new instrument
              development executives of Hewlett Packard and Varian and they will meet as  a
              group to define a laboratory course for chemistry majors entitled "Molecular
              Characterization  and Measurement".  The goal of the course is to make a
              fundamental change in the laboratory  experiences for chemistry majors by using
              the methodologies practiced not only in academic  laboratories, but also those
              used in industrial and government laboratories.
