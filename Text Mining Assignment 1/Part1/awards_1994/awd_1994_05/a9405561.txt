Abstract    :
              9405561  Riley  To carry out integration of information on the genome of the
              bacterium E. coli scientists working on E. coli in different areas will meet. 
              The sequencers, cloners, geneticists, cell physiologists, biochemists, database
              builders and computer scientists all come from different perspectives that are
              now fusing.  This meeting will facilitate the necessary interactions by
              bringing together leading researchers in the analysis of genomes at the genetic
              and sequence level, and will facilitate the coordination of the structural and
              functional analysis of this organism's genome.  %%%  The E. coli genome
              analysis efforts are likely to be the first which will achieve a complete
              sequence determination of  a free-living organism.  At this writing over 2000
              genes and open reading frames  have been sequenced, over 55% of the chromosomal
              DNA, and their gene products where identified are in the Swiss Protein
              database.  The extensive genetic, physiological and biochemical knowledge of E.
              coli make this the best defined of all organisms.  There is much excitement
              surrounding the unprecedented opportunity now to integrate these bodies of
              information as we approach total sequence E. coli DNA and all gene products.
