Abstract    :
              9405197  Kepezhinskas       The Kamchatka Peninsula is the site of shallow
              subduction of  the Hawaii-Emperor seamount chain.  subduction of these
              seamounts  (and the associated ridge) have perturbed the sear-level record on 
              the peninsula and also the volcanic activity associated with  subduction of the
              Pacific plate.  This project is to help constrain  the deformational response,
              age of deformation, and rate and style  of uplift of this area. It will be
              investigated in cooperation with  the Russian Academy of Science.  The results
              should provide an  improved basics for interpreting the complex structural and 
              geochemical effects of seamounts on still active and ancient arc  systems.
