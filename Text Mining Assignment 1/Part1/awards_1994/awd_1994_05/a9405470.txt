Abstract    :
              9405470  Kohlstedt  This project involves experimental research on the 
              solubility of water in nominally anhydrous mantel minerals  (olivine and
              selected pyroxenes) and on the role of water in  ionic diffusion in olivine. 
              The research involves three  aspects:  (1) determining the speciation of water
              in  olivine, using experimental data on the solubility of water  in olivine
              obtained at pressures of , 0.3 GPa to ~ 12 GPa  and over a wide range of water
              fugacity and proton activity,  (2) constraining the upper limit for water
              content of the  upper mantle, using measured solubilities of water in high-  Ca
              pyroxene as a function of water fugacity and proton  activity, and (3)
              determining the mechanism by which water  affects diffusion-dependent
              properties in nominally  anhydrous minerals, using dependence of Fe-Mg
              interdiffusion  and O tracer diffusion on water fugacity and proton  activity. 
              The results of these laboratory experiments will  provide fundamental
              constraints on the extent to which  nominally anhydrous minerals can be
              reservoirs for water in  the mantle and also on the magnitude of the effect of
              water  on diffusion-dependent properties such as creep and  electrical
              conductivity of mantle rocks.
