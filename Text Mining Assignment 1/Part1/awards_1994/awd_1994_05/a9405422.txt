Abstract    :
              Protein tyrosine phosphorylation is a remarkably conserved  mechanism which is
              implicated in the control of cell growth,  differentiation and cell survival in
              organisms as distantly  related as yeast and humans.  Although many tyrosine
              kinases  have been described, only recently have protein tyrosine  phosphatases
              (PTPases) been implicated in receptor tyrosine  kinase (RTK) mediated signal
              transduction pathways.  The  goal of this proposal is to analyze the PTPase,
              encoded by  the Drosophila gene 'corkscrew' (csw), and its role in  signal
              transduction. In addition to csw's putative catalytic  activity, it also
              encodes two SH2 domains, and an SH3  binding concensus sequence, suggesting
              that 'csw' can  mediate heteomeric protein interactions.  'csw' is among the 
              first PTPases whose gene mutations are facilitating a  genetic analysis of
              function in vivo.  The structure and  function of the 'csw' protein will be
              investigated.  The  expression and activity of the 'csw' protein will be 
              analyzed in normal and mutant development.  Biochemical and  genetic screens
              will be conducted to identify proteins that  interact with 'csw'.  These
              studies will collectively  further our understanding of the role of a PTPase, 
              covalently linked to two SH2 domains, in a signal  transduction pathway
              initiated at the membrane by a RTK.
