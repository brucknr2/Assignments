Abstract    :
              9405808  Oliker    A continuing investigation of nonlinear diffusion flows 
              propagating with speed depending on mean, Gauss, and other  curvature functions
              is proposed.  Such diffusion processes play a  critical role in models of phase
              transitions, flame propagation,  material wearing, signal and image processing,
              and others.   Questions of existence, uniqueness, onset of singularities, and 
              asymptotic properties will be studied.  Efficient and robust  algorithms for
              computing diffusion flows will be developed and  tested.    The results will be
              applied to improve existing and develop new  computational algorithms and codes
              for image and signal  processing.  It is anticipated that the developed image 
              processing codes will have a variety of important applications in 
              communications, medicine, target identification, and Global  Change studies,
              especially for denoising images distorted by  atmospheric turbulence.
