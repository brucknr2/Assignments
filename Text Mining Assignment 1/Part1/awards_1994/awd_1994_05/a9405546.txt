Abstract    :
              9405546  Kyle  The Jinding deposit in Yunnan Province is the largest Pb-Zn
              deposit in China and the world's largest and geologically youngest example of
              the "sandstone-type" Pb-Zn deposit.  The overall research plan is to establish
              the detailed geologic framework for the Jinding and associated deposits through
              a combination of field and mine mapping, core logging, and petrology.  Sections
              of drill holes through the deposit have been logged and sampled to provide the
              three-dimensional framework to govern petrographic and geochemical studies. 
              Brines have been collected from wells within the region for comparison with the
              "ore-forming" fluids as evidenced by fluid inclusions in diagenetic cements. 
              Petrography will be used to assess relevant porosity and permeability
              relationship of the stratigraphic section.  detailed sampling will maximize the
              results of geochemical and isotopic analyses.  Isotope studies will include C
              and O analyses of carbonates, S isotope studies of sulfates (celestite and
              gypsum), and complementary S and Pb isotope studies of sulfide minerals.  Sr
              isotope studies will be made of major Sr-bearing phases (celestite, gypsum, and
              calcite).  The project results will make a significant contribution to the
              knowledge of sediment-hosted mineral deposits, and particularly to our
              understanding of the link between fluid evolution and diagenetic processes in
              continental basins.
