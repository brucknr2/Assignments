Abstract    :
              9405498  Beroza     This research is to analyze earthquake multiplets and
              clusters  using digital waveform data from the Calnet seismic network in 
              northern California.  The goals of the study are to 1) develop a  catalog of
              similar earthquakes for northern and central California  in order to study the
              factors that influence the occurrence of  multiplets, presumably creep-related,
              and 2) to detect and  understand changes in crustal wave propagation associated
              with a  major earthquake.  Preliminary work has detected co-seismic and 
              possibly pre-seismic velocity changes related to the 1989 Loma  Prieta
              earthquake, and these phenomena will be investigated in more  detail.  This
              research is a component of the National Earthquake  Hazard Reduction Program.
