Abstract    :
              9405654  Jones  The University of the District of Columbia requests support from
               NSF for connection of their campus networks to SURAnet.  SURAnet is  the
              midlevel network located in the southeastern United States.  It  will provide
              operations management and information services and it  will give the University
              of the District of Columbia a 56 thousand  bits per second connection to the
              NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45  million bits per second) National Backbone
              network.    Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.  By 
              linking to the mid-level and national networks the University's  faculty and
              academics will maintain a position of leadership in  research and educational
              innovation by profiting from remote access  to super computer centers, data
              bases and information services,  high speed communications, file transfer and
              remote login, and  access to library resources.  This is also a unique
              opportunity for  the school to explore innovative educational resources.
