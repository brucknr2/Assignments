Abstract    :
              9405628  Elmore       This award provides one-half of the funds required for 
              the acquisition of a cryocooled cryogenic magnetometer and  an automated
              alternating field demagnetizer to be installed  and used for research and
              teaching in the School of Geology  and Geophysics at the University of
              Oklahoma. The University  is committed to providing the remaining funds needed
              for the  acquisition.       The new magnetometer system will be applied mainly
              to  the study of sedimentary rock magnetism and how their  magnetism is altered
              by the flow of fluids through the  Earth's crust. The scale, mechanism, and
              timing of large  scale fluid flow through the crust has implications for 
              understanding the evolution of sedimentary basins and their  potential for oil
              production.  ***
