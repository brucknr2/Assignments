Abstract    :
              9405533  Ruff                             This research will systematically
              study the seismic events that  may precede a large earthquake: multiplets,
              foreshocks, and rupture  precursors.  In parallel with the earthquake studies,
              the work will  involve the development of simple mechanical models of
              interaction  between stick-slip and creeping portions of the plate interface.  
              The goal of these models is to provide an explanation of  observations such as
              variability in recurrence times, rupture  modes, and earthquake size form one
              earthquake cycle to the next.   The overall goal is a systematic study of
              multiplets, foreshocks,  and rupture precursors and how these seismicity
              features relate to  other geologic characteristics in their tectonic setting. 
              This  research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction 
              Program.  ***
