Abstract    :
              9405720  Lohmann       This award provides partial funding to support a 
              technician assigned to the operations of the stable isotope  laboratory in the
              Department of Geological Sciences at the  University of Michigan. The
              laboratory instrumentation  includes four operating mass spectrometers,
              extraction lines  for analysis of the stable isotope ratios of hydrogen, 
              carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur in inorganic and organic  samples, and a
              laser fluorination system for oxygen  extraction from small sample volumes. A
              large number of  graduate students, faculty researchers and postdoctoral 
              fellows in the Department of Geological Sciences employ  stable isotope
              measurements as the main analytical tool in  their research. In addition, the
              laboratory hosts an  unusually large number of visiting scientists from the
              U.S.  and abroad. The large research productivity of the lab now  requires the
              assistance of a full-time technician who will  assist with operation and
              maintenance, training of users,  and with the development of new techniques.
              Much of the  research applications of the analytical data from this  laboratory
              are in the area of global change and  environmental geochemistry.  ***
