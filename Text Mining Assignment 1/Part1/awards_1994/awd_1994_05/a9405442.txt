Abstract    :
              9405442  Hudson  The proposal study is an in-depth investigation of the origins
              of  the nonexponential fluorescence decay behavior of indole and its  simple
              methylated derivatives in fluid polar solutions.  This  behavior will be
              contrasted with the dipolar relaxation process  that is observed with viscous
              polar solvents which can be  distinguished on the basis of its characteristic
              red-edge  excitation behavior.  Hypotheses as to the origin of this behavior 
              will be tested.  These included a specific exciplex formation  process and
              electron ejection to solvating defects present in polar  solvents.  The data
              obtained with a variety of solvents (including  mixed solvents with variable
              composition), variation of  temperature, variable excitation and emission
              wavelength and for a  variety of indole analogs will be analyzed using the
              Maximum  Entropy method.   %%%  This project is a collaborative effort
              involving workers at the  University of Oregon and Professor Alex Demchenko of
              the Institute  of Biochemistry of Kiev, Ukraine.  The funds requested are 
              primarily for support of Dr. Demchenko's effort.  The benefits to  our
              research, particularly his development of the red-edge  excitation effect as a
              useful diagnostic method, his knowledge of  scientific literature in this field
              available only in Russian and  his familiarity with the Maximum Entropy method
              of analysis of  fluorescence data.  ***
