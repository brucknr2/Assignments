Abstract    :
              9405072  Bungay  This project is on research to develop an economic process for 
              the bioconversion of waste paper into acetate.  This includes  using a
              continuous cultivation technique in which the feeding  rate of the solid
              substrate is regulated to match the consumption  rate of a mixed anaerobic
              culture of microorganisms.  The  objective is a high rate continuous process
              which does not  require a sterile environment.  ***
