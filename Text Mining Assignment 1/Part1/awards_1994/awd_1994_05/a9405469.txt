Abstract    :
                9405469  Washburn    The Principal Investigator will employ interlaced or
              overlapping  gates to govern transmission of carriers into and out of tailored 
              cavities etched into ballistic heterostructures to study a new  quantum
              transport effects.  The two main targets of the research  are (1) Luttinger
              correlations among carriers in wires at low  carrier density and high magnetic
              field and (2) chaotic response  from specially designed cavities.  In both
              cases gates will cover  the entire device to aid in screening by the
              electrostatic  potentials and to allow control over carrier concentration.  
              Separate gates will control transmission coefficients in the probes  feeding
              and sensing the wires and cavities.  This will allow, for  the first time,
              individual control over these two critical  parameters, which in turn will
              allow more detailed exploration of  these two new areas of transport physics.  
               % % % %    The Principal Investigator build new kinds of ballistic electrical 
              devices where the electrons travel in perfect, disorder-free  crystals and
              collide only with features created by the architects  of the devices.  The
              devices will allow more complete control of  the electrical parameters than has
              been attempted before.  The  devices will be used to understand two newly
              discovered electronic  effects of current and fundamental interest to the
              physics  community.  The first is a subtle way in which electrons repel each 
              other in the midst of a sea of electrons that is confined so that  the
              electrons cannot easily escape the repulsive forces.  The  second is the
              chaotic motion of electrons in situations where  irregular orbits are possible.
