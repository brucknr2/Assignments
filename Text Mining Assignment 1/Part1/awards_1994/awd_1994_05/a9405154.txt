Abstract    :
              9405154  Oboh        PI will examine taxonomy and distribution of dinoflagellate
               cysts (palynoflora) and detrital organic matter in Eocene units of  the
              Jackson Group, eastern Gulf Coast, U.S.A.  This information  will be combined
              with sporomorph data and used for high-resolution  biostratigraphy, in
              particular the Eocene-Oligocene boundary.  The  study will also evaluate the
              relation between palynofacies and  sediment response to sea level changes.
