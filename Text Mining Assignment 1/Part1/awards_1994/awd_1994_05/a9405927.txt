Abstract    :
              9405927  Romanowicz    This research is a continuation of investigations of the
              3-D  anelastic structure of the mantle using seismological data.  The  recent
              work with mantle Rayleigh waves has resulted in a 3-D model  of Q in the upper
              mantle,  which has demonstrated that there is  hope to extract useful
              information on the mantle's thermal  structure, not redundant with elastic
              tomography results.  Features  of interest of this model include correlation
              with cooling plate  models in the first 200 km of depth as well as two maxima
              in  attenuation in the transition zone, correlated with hotspot  strength
              distribution.  This research will 1) investigate ways in  which anelastic
              tomography results can be incorporated as  additional constraints in dynamical
              modeling of the earth's mantle;  2) improve the resolution of the upper-mantle
              model by a) including  new data available with the rapid expansion of the
              IRIS/GSN  network, b) adding constraints form Love waves, c) taking into 
              account effects of focusing explicitly; and 3) investigate lateral  variations
              of Q in the lower mantle, using both body wave and  normal mode data.  ***
