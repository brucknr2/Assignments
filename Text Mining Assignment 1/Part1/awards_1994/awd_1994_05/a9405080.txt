Abstract    :
              9405080  Geissman       The mechanics of extremely extended terranes is
              incompletely  understood, with several models proposed. This project will
              utilize  Cenozoic Death Valley, California extreme extension to test the 
              "rolling hinge" model.  The work includes structural,  stratigraphic,
              paleomagnetic and geochronologic tests and is  intended to lead to a better
              understanding of the three-dimensional  aspects of extension.  Results should
              provides a robust assessment  the viability of the extreme extensional model.
