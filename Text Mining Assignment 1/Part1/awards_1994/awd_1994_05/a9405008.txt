Abstract    :
              9405008  Wolf       This research is concerned with applying the techniques and 
              knowledge of information theory and communications theory to  achieve ultra
              high density information storage.  An important  component of this research is
              an experimental program by which it  is  planned to characterize the effects of
              the storage channel on  the information bearing signals.  The results of these
              measurements  are utilized to create accurate mathematical models of the
              storage  channel.  Examination of these models then suggests new modulation, 
              detection, and coding systems.  The performance of these new  systems is
              predicted by simulation and by theoretical analysis  based on the models. 
              Finally, hardware implementations of the most  promising of these systems may
              be constructed and tested on real  storage systems.   ***
