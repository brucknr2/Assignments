Abstract    :
              9405311  Flessa  PIs and Mexican collaborator will attempt to develop a
              relatively  inexpensive geochronological tool for the analysis of Holocene, 
              mixed-age deposits.  Amino acid racemization ratios will be  calibrated by
              radiocarbon dating in modern to 4,000-year-old  mollusks from the cheniers of
              the Colorado Delta of Baja  California, Mexico.
