Abstract    :
              9405438  Rossman         This award provides one-half the funding required for 
              the  acquisition  of  components  needed  to  modernize  the  electron 
              microprobe instrument housed and operated  in  the  Division  of Earth and
              Planetary Sciences at the  California  Institute  of  Technology. The
              institution is  committed  to  providing  the  remaining funds necessary for
              this  upgrade.  The  upgrade  will  provide new computer  control  and  data 
              processing  and  will allow the electron microprobe  lab  at  Caltech   to  
              improve   the  reliability   and   analytical  capabilities  of the eight-year
              old instrument  so  that  it  performs   comparably  to  modern  equipment. 
              The  electron  microprobe   at   Caltech  is  used  primarily   to   obtain 
              quantitative chemical composition, with micron scale spatial  resolution,  of 
              geological  and extra-terrestrial  material  samples  needed for a wide variety
              of research  projects  in  the geosciences.  ***
