Abstract    :
              9405557  Mitra       This collaborative project will test the generally accepted
               critical wedge theory for the development of fold and thrust belts,  by an
              integrated field and laboratory study of rocks in the Lewis  thrust sheet in
              northwest Montana.  According to the theory, strain  should vary within the
              thrust belt as a function of the geometry of  the sedimentary prism.  The
              stratigraphy of the area is well known  and lends itself to a test of the
              model.  The geometry of the pre-  deformational Proterozoic, Paleozoic and
              lower Mesozoic sedimentary  basins will be determined and the amount and
              distribution of strain  will be compared with that predicted by the model. 
              Whether the  existing theory is upheld or not, the results will have far- 
              reaching significance for other fold and thrust belts, and for the  prediction
              and recovery of oil and natural gas reserves in similar  tectonic settings.
