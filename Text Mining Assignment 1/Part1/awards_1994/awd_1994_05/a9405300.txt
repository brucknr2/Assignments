Abstract    :
              9405300  Rhodes       PI will investigate, in collaboration with members of the 
              British Antarctic Survey, the energy needs of the living polar  brachiopod
              species, Liothyrella uva, and compare it to a sympatric  bivalve species.  This
              work will lead to a larger-scale comparative  study of species from temperate
              and tropical waters.  The study is  intended to test the hypothesis that
              large-scale changes in  diversity and shifts in habitat, inferred from the
              fossil record,  have been shaped primarily by individual-level biological 
              interactions, a hotly debated topic.  Competing hypotheses are that  chance and
              environmental changes account for most of the large-  scale patterns found
              during the history of life.
