Abstract    :
              This grant from the  Organic Dynamics Program supports the continuing   research
              of  Professor Vernon Parker at Utah State University. Primary   objectives are
              experiments designed to determine factors that affect both   the reactivity and
              thermodynamics of reactions in solution that involve   organic radical ions and
              organic ions. Through the use of electochemical   techniques  reactions of 
              radical cations of  substituted   alkylanthracenes with nucleophiles  will be
              studied to determine   fundamental thermodynamic parameters associated with
              steric effects on   radical cations. Experiments are designed that will obtain
              data for     carbon- and hydrogen-heteroatom bond dissociation energies in
              solution.    Electrochemical methods will be used to measure accurately the
              strengths   of chemical bonds in molecules for which experimental data is  
              unavailable. These new results  will allow the scientific community to  
              compute with better accuracy the behavior of molecules by the use of  
              fundamental thermodynamic equations.
