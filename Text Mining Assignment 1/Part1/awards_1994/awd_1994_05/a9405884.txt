Abstract    :
              Plant development differs from animal development in a  variety of fundamental
              ways.  The flower of the cruciferous  plant Arabidopsis thaliana is being used
              as a model to  attempt to understand the basic molecular mechanisms that 
              control plant development.  In particular, the proposed  experiments focus on
              the specification of organ identity in  the flower.  Experiments performed in
              recent years in a  number of plant species, in particular in Arabidopsis and 
              snapdragon, have revealed that the genes that control the  specification of
              organ identity in the flower are highly  conserved in different plant species. 
              Thus, information  gathered about flower development in Arabidopsis is likely 
              to be applicable to other plant species.  The experiments  proposed here deal
              with the characterization of APETALA3  (AP3), a homeotic gene involved in
              specifying the  development of petals and stamens in the flower.  AP3 has  been
              cloned and its RNA and protein expression patterns  characterized.  The AP3
              protein has a conserved 57 amino  acid domain called the MADS domain.  The MADS
              domain is  postulated to encode a DNA binding function, and there is  evidence
              that AP3 binds DNA.  Elucidation of the biological  function o the plant MADS
              domain proteins, however, has been  hindered by the lack of a biologically
              relevant target (DNA  binding) sequence.  The first set of proposed experiments
              is  aimed at defining the sequences in the AP3 promoter involved  in
              establishment, maintenance (autoregulation), and ovule-  specific expression of
              AP3.  The second set of proposed  experiments is designed to identify genes
              that interact,  regulate, or are regulated by AP3.  The genetic interactions 
              of the suppressor and enhancer mutations with both ap3 and  the other floral
              homeotic mutants will be characterized.
