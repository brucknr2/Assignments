Abstract    :
              9405772  Bralower       Investigation of some of the most topical problems in
              Mesozoic  paleoceanography, paleobiology and tectonics are currently limited 
              by the lack of an accurate and precise time scale.  Pertinent  examples include
              estimating rates of evolution of fossil organisms  and the factors that control
              them, accumulation rates of organic  matter and their relationship with oceanic
              anoxia, and sea floor  spreading and oceanic crustal production rates and their
               paleoclimatic significance.  We propose to significantly improve  the
              precision of the Late mesozoic time scale by investigating the  U-Pb zircon
              geochronology of Lower Cretaceous tuffs and bentonites  from the Great Valley
              Group, Northern California.  Because the  biostratigraphically with calcareous
              nannofossils, the pelecypod,  Buchia and time scale, and indirectly to a
              chronostratigraphy for  the entire Late mesozoic (Late Jurassic to Late
              Cretaceous)  interval.  In addition, tighter absolute age control will allow 
              narrower constraints to be placed on the periodicities of  sedimentary cycles,
              thus enhancing the applicability of  cyclostratigraphy as a stratigraphic tool.
