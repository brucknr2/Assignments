Abstract    :
              9405242  Slominski    Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) is the precursor of the 
              biologically active neuropeptides adrenocorticotropin  (ACTH), endorphins,
              melanotropins (MSH) and lipotropins  (LPH).  Although the gene coding for POMC
              is transcribed  predominantly in the pituitary gland, its expression has  also
              been detected in the central nervous system and in a  variety of peripheral
              tissues including skin.  The PI,  therefore, hypothesizes that local
              (cutaneous) production of  POMC peptides is a part of a system involved in the 
              regulation of physiological responses of the skin.  The main  objective of the
              current research is to identify cutaneous  cells expressing proopiomelanocortin
              (POMC), to correlate  POMC expression and processing with the cyclic activity
              of  hair follicles, to test whether corticotropin releasing  hormone (CRH) and
              glucocorticoids regulate production of  POMC peptides and to detect and
              characterize CRH receptors.  To realize this goal, molecular, biochemical, 
              immunocytochenical and cell biology techniques will be  utilized.  The
              realization of the project will support the  concept that peripheral POMC
              activity may be an integral  part of the biological clock regulating cyclic
              activity of  hair follicles and periodic changes of skin physiology.  It  is
              already accepted that residential cells of the skin  respond phenotypically to
              ACTH and MSH, that there is a skin  associated immune system and the
              beta-endorphin, MSH and  ACTH can act as immunomodulators.  Therefore, it
              appears  that local production of POMC peptides may be a part of  signals
              regulating physiological responses of the skin.  ***
