Abstract    :
              9405510  Baldwin       This award provides partial funding for the support of  a
              technician position in the University of Arizona noble gas  mass spectrometry
              laboratory that is shared by the  departments of  geosciences and planetary
              sciences. The  support of the technician is to be cost-shared with funding 
              from the National Aeronautics and Space Agency and from the  University of
              Arizona. The technician will be responsible  for the day-to-day management and
              operation of the  laboratory, including maintenance of equipment, design 
              modifications, and developmental techniques       The research applications of
              the Principal Investigator  and colleagues in the noble gas mass spectrometry
              lab focus  on geochronology using the argon-40/argon-39 method and on 
              cosmochemistry based on the systematics of the iodine-  129/xenon-129 system.
