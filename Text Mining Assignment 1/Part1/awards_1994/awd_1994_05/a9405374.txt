Abstract    :
              9405374  Jacobsen    Project involves development of a high-precision 87Rb-86Sr
              dating   technique applicable to both lavas and foraminifera.  One objective  
              is the evaluation of this method for leucite-bearing Italian  volcanics by
              study of groundmass minerals and phenocrysts in  historical lavas.  A second is
              an evaluation of the disequilibrium  dating method applied to both shallow and
              deep water samples  containing forams from the Pacific, plus initial
              investigation  using del 234U dating of forminiferal  ooze  in Toba Ash
              horizons.   The ultimate goal is to provide precisely time-resolved climate 
              proxy records to increase our ability to understand causes of  cyclic variation
              in climate.
