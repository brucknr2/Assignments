Abstract    :
              9405163  Geissman       Controversial aspects of extensional Cordilleran
              metamorphic  core complexes includes original dip of detachment faulty the 
              origin of mylonite and the applicability of the rolling hinge model  to
              describe their evolution.  This project extends results on the  South Mountain
              core complex, Arizona that indicated shallow initial  fault dips, but this core
              complex formed a relatively shallow  crustal levels and may not be
              representative.  This work is aimed  at the deeper Harquahala, Harcuvar,
              Buckskin and Whipple  detachments.  Results will allow a definitive assessment
              of large-  scale structures associated with these deep-type metamorphic core 
              complexes.
