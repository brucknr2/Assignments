Abstract    :
              9405747  Henry  The proposed research will address the role of tourmaline as  a
              monitor of the metamorphic history of the rocks in which  it occurs.  The study
              has three petrologic and geochemical  objectives: (1) evaluation of
              consequences and significance  of the polar nature of tourmaline - which may
              give insights  into element partitioning as influenced by surface energy 
              effects, (2) investigation of the sporadic release of B in  metamorphic
              environments and its significance to tourmaline  growth - which will be
              critical in understanding the B cycle  in igneous and metamorphic rocks, and
              (3) establishment of  the significance of development or loss of tourmaline in 
              high grade metamorphic rocks due to metamorphic fluids -  which may elucidate
              the chemistry of fluids as it related to  mineral chemistry and texture. 
              Metamorphic samples from NW  Maine will be studied.  The research will require
              electron  and ion probe analyses of tourmaline.
