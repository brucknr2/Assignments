Abstract    :
              9405629  Lamb  This research will investigate the behavior of  fluids in  the
              system H2O-CO2-CH4-NaCl in the range 400-750 oC and 0.5-  2.0 kb.  The ternary
              subsystems will have priority for study  before research on the quaternary
              system is initiated.  The  experiments will utilize synthetically produced
              fluid  inclusion to trap samples of fluids at controlled  temperatures and
              pressures.  The ultimate objective is to  arrive at an empirical relationship
              from which the molar  volume of a fluid can be predicted for specified P-T-X 
              conditions.  The results will ultimately find application in  studies of the
              formation and evolution of many base and  precious metal ore deposits, the
              development of metamorphic  mineral assemblages and the transfer of heat during
               metamorphism, igneous processes such as partial metling, and  diagenesis.
