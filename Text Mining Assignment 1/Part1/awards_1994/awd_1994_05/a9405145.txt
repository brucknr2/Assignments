              Abstract  ATM-9405145  Grimm, Eric C.  Illinois State Museum  Title: Long
              Records of Paleoclimate from Florida    Recent research on a continuous
              50,000-year sediment record from  eastern North America has revealed a striking
              correlation between  Heinrich events (large surges in flow of ice streams
              feeding from  the Laurentide ice sheet into the North Atlantic) and major
              changes  in vegetation in peninsular Florida.  These events are expressed at 
              Lake Tulane, Florida, as abrupt shifts between pine-dominated and 
              oak-dominated communities, which likely correspond with times of  moist climate
              alternating with periods of extreme drought.   Those  results suggest that  the
              Heinrich events involved important  changes in ocean-atmosphere circulation,
              and thus forcing other  than internal dynamics of the ice sheet.  This award
              supports a  research project designed with the following objectives: (1) To 
              establish a higher-resolution AMS-radiocarbon chronology for the  sediments of
              Lake Tulane.  The record will verify whether the  vegetational shifts in
              Florida are indeed synchronous with Heinrich  events; (2) To reconstruct the
              history of lake-level fluctuations  in Lake Tulane; (3) To extend the regional
              and temporal records of  vegetation and climate for peninsular Florida by
              studying the  pollen stratigraphy of new long cores (already collected) from 
              several in-filled sinkholes.  These sediments appear likely to span  much more
              than the 50,000 years covered by the Lake Tulane record,  and thus have
              excellent potential to produce the first record of  changes in vegetation and
              climate spanning the last complete  glacial/interglacial cycle in eastern North
              America.
