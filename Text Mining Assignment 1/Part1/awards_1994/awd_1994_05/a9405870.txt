Abstract    :
              9405870  Edwards    This research, which is a collaboration between the
              California  Institute of Technology, the University of Minnesota and the 
              University of Texas, is a study of the two great plate-boundary  faults of
              Sumatra.  Preliminary studies funded by the NSF  demonstrate the high potential
              of these projects.  The work  addresses fundamental questions concerning both
              the repeatability  of great earthquakes and the kinematics of obliquely
              convergent  plate boundaries; results would apply to earthquake hazard at 
              plate-boundary faults in the U.S. in California, the Pacific  Northwest and
              Alaska.  The goals are 1) to use submerged and  emergent late Holocene corals
              to map and to date vertical  deformations associated with great historical,
              ancient and future  earthquakes of the Sumatran subduction zone and 2) to
              complete a  neotectonic map of the right-lateral strike-slip Great Sumatran 
              fault and to determine its late Quaternary rates of slip.  This  research is a
              component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction  Program.  ***
