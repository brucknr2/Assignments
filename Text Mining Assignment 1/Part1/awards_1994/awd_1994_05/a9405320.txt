Abstract    :
              9405320  Swisher    Available paleontological data indicate that much of our 
              evolutionary history is recorded in rocks on  the African  continent.  An
              important exception to this, is the origin  and evolution of Homo erectus. 
              Numerous specimens of early  hominids have been recovered from the Javanese
              sites of  Sangiran, Perning,Kedungbrubus, Sambungmacan, and Ngandong. 
              Considerable debate continues, however, as to the taxonomic  affinity and
              particularly the age of many of these finds.  The debate over the age of the
              Javanese hominids centers  around two questions; the precise stratigraphic
              placemtn of  some of the fossil specimens and the precise age of these 
              deposits.    This project, by the outstanding geochronology group in the 
              world, will develop a detailed geochronological framework in  order to
              calibrate temporally the evolution of hominids in  Java.  Current age estaimtes
              for some finds vary  dramatically from slightly over 2 million years ago to as 
              young as 200,000 years ago. They will 1)use incremental  laser and resistance
              furnace heating argon isotope  techniques to date pumice-bearing horizons
              associated with  hominid sites in Java, 2) date directly hominids and/or 
              associated mammalian fossils that have sufficient amounts of  volcanic material
              attached for argon isotope dating, and 3)  develop and refine the currently
              available  magnetostratigraphies of Plio-Pleistocene hominid-bearing 
              stratigraphic sections of Java.  The resultant chronology  will permit the
              construction of a detailed temporal history  of Javanese hominids, and allow
              for the first time, precise  temporal correlation of the Javanese Homo erectus
              with  hominid and faunal evets in the Plio-Pleistocene of Africa.
