Abstract    :
              9405354  Landau  This grant is in support of a Workshop on Recent Developments
              in  Computer Simulation Studies in Condensed Matter Physics to be held  at the
              University of Georgia February 28 - March 4, 1994.  The  workshop provides a
              "hands-on" environment to discuss new research  results in condensed matter and
              materials physics, present new  computational methods and to test new hardware.
              Attendence of young  scientists, graduate students and postdoctoral associates
              is  encouraged.  The workshop is particularly important in promoting  the use
              of massively parallel computers with the computational  materials and condensed
              matter physics communities.  %%%  ***
