Abstract    :
              9405625  Bebout  The proposed research will extend existing research to test 
              the utility of the N-isotopic system as a tracer of high  temperature
              fluid-rock interactions, both in metamorphic and  magmatic systems.  The
              project will (1) constrain sources of  fractionation in the N isotopic system
              (through melting,  devolatilization, etc.; primarily among N2, NH3, and NH4+), 
              (2) identify N-isotopic signatures characteristic of various  magmatic,
              metamorphic, and meteoric fluid sources, and (3)  improve techniques for the
              more routine extraction of N from  silicate materials for isotopic analysis. 
              The first two  goals will be achieved through study of N isotopic  systematics
              for three field areas: the Skiddaw Granite and  Aureole, England, the Birch
              Creek Granite and Aureole,  California; and the Peninsula Ranges Batholith,
              California.  The third goal will involve continuation of experimentation  with
              high-temperature combustion and fusion techniques,  further lowering of
              analytical blanks, and improvement of  techniques for mass spectrometry of
              extremely small N2  samples.
