Abstract    :
              9405696  Bowring  Prior research in the Proterozoic of Arizona and New Mexico 
              has resulted in a hypothesis that, after initial accretion,  the proterozoic
              orogenic belt remained stable from 1.7 Ga to  1.4 Ga, with isotherms moving
              through the rock very slowly,  allowing extensive diffusional loss of argon
              from various  minerals, preserved as extreme gradations from cones to  rims. 
              An alternative hypothesis of partial resetting by  heat from younger intrusions
              does not fit well with the  geologic history, pattern of metamorphism,
              petrologic  aspects of re-metamorphism or known volume of plutons, but 
              remaining an attractive alternative.  The project will  attempt to test these
              alternatives in a field and  geochronological program.  The project offers a
              strong  opportunity to study thermal evolution of newly formed  continental
              lithosphere and to unravel how stable cratonic  geotherms are attained.
