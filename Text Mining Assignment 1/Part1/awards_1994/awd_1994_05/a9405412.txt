Abstract    :
              9405412  Goodfriend       PIs and Mexican collaborator will attempt to develop a
               relatively inexpensive geochronological tool for the analysis of  Holocene,
              mixed-age deposits.  Amino acid racemization ratios will  be calibrated by
              radiocarbon dating in modern to 4,000-year-old  mollusks from the cheniers of
              the Colorado Delta of Baja  California, Mexico.
