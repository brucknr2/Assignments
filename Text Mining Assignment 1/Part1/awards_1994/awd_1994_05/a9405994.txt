Abstract    :
              9405994  Stone  The goal of this study is to establish the physical 
              volcanology, geochemistry, and petrogenesis of selected  komatiitic successions
              in the Abitibi-Pontiac region of the  Superior Province.  The project will
              involve:  1) the  delineation of volcanic facies in outcrop and diamond drill 
              core in key localities; 2) analysis of whole-rock major and  trace elements
              (including rare-earth, high field-strength,  and platinum-group elements) in
              selected samples; 3)  analysis of relict igneous minerals (silicates, oxides, 
              sulfides, and platinum-group minerals) by X-ray emission  spectrometry; 4)
              analysis of Os isotopes by negative thermal  ionization mass  spectrometry at
              the Australian National University; and  5)  analysis of Nd and Hf isotopes. 
              This study will provide  important constraints on the geodynamic settings of
              the  Abitibi and Pontiac greenstone belts, and contribute greatly  to our
              understanding of the petrogenesis of komatiites and  the development of Archean
              greenstone belts.
