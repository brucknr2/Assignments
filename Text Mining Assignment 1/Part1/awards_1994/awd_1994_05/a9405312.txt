Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support for a portion of the travel  costs of speakers
              invited to participate in the 9th Annual  Penn State Symposium in Plant
              Physiology to be held May 19-  21, 1994, in State College, Pennsylvania.  The
              topic for  1994 is "Pollen-pistil interactions".  This symposium will  bring
              together outstanding scientists who will provide  critical analyses and
              syntheses of recent research  concerning the development of pollen and pistils,
              pollen-  stigma interactions (e.g., the nature of the pollen coat and 
              sporophytic self-incompatibility), the mechanisms of growth  in pollen tubes
              and analagous systems such as root hairs and  fungal hyphae, pollen-style
              interactions (e.g., post-  pollination signaling and gametophytic self- 
              incompatibility), pollen selection (non-random  fertilization) and the
              processes of fertilization.  This  topic is of tremendous interest to both
              basic and applied  plant scientists.  One of the goals for this symposium is to
               foster interaction and communication among scientists of all  ranks working in
              academia, government and industry spanning  the spectrum from basic to applied
              research.
