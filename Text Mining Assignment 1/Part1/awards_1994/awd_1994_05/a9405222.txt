Abstract    :
              9405222  Chesley  The project has two main goals:  1) to test the potential  for
              high-precision geochronology on young rocks using the Re-  Os dating system;
              and 2) to investigate the degree of  involvement of the continental crust with
              the mantle during  the formation of flood basalts.  The PIs will accomplish 
              these goals by undertaking a systematic investigation of the  continental flood
              basalts in the western United States.  Results from these investigations should
              bear significantly  on the use of Re-Os isotopic system as a chronometer and
              for  examining the degree of mantle-crust interaction during the  formation of
              flood basalts.  In addition to adding  significantly to our knowledge of the
              Re-Os isotopic  characteristics of the mantle and crust, the resulting data 
              will enhance our understanding of the geochronologic  potential of the Re-Os
              system and should provide critical  information  pertaining to the formation of
              flood basalts.
