Abstract    :
              Bock  9405934  The objectives of this research are to continue to serve as a
              University NAVSTAR consortium (UNAVCO) facility for the archiving and analysis
              of GPS global tracking data to support regional crustal deformation projects. 
              Improve the timeliness of global products from the present 7- to 10-day delay
              to a 1- to 2-day delay to support in-the-field data analysis, particularly in
              the presence of Anti-Spoofing (AS) and Selective Availability (SA). The
              research will also develop and implement methodoloies to integrate regional and
              global geodetic networds in order to improve estimates of plate motions and map
              plate-boundary deformation.  Develop strategies for distributed analysis of
              large metworks of global and regional extent. Finally, to expand the scope of
              the facility to assist investigators in the analysis of regional networks in a
              globally defined reference frame.  ****
