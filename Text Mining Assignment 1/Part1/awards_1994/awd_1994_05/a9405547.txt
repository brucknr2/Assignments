Abstract    :
              9405547  Humphreys    This research is to model the dynamics of instantaneous 
              deformation of the western U.S.  The deformation is broadly  distributed and
              diverse, yet the occurrence of domains of similar  tectonic style suggest that
              nearly uniform processes occur over  broad regions.  Together with existing
              knowledge of crustal  structure and relative plate motion data, estimated
              strength and  density structure provide the necessary information to forward 
              model by means of finite- element computer codes the dynamics of  western U.S.
              deformation.  The resulting predicted deformation and  stress fields can then
              be compared with space-based geodetic data  for model refinement.  The product
              is directly applicable to  estimation of earthquake hazards in the western U.S.
               This research  is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction
              Program.  ***
