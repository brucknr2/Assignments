Abstract    :
              9405881  Wright       This award provides one-half of the funds required for 
              the repair of a thermal ionization mass spectrometer  operated in the
              Department of  Geology and Geophysics at the  William Marsh rice University.
              Rice University is committed  to providing the remaining funds necessary for
              the repair.  The instrument is heavily used in analytical measurements of 
              uranium-lead isotopes, trace elements and isotopic tracers  such as strontium
              and neodymium in the igneous petrology and  tectonic evolution research
              programs of several faculty  members and their students at Rice. During the
              course of  research last year a catastrophic failure of the instrument 
              occurred after inadvertent contamination inside the vacuum.  The repair will
              include thorough disassembly and cleaning of  the instrument at the
              manufacturer's factory and will be  guaranteed by the manufacturer.  ***
