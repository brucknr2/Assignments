Abstract    :
              9405266  Beard  The goal of the proposed research is to create amphibole-  melt
              experimental data sets at 2,  5, and 8 kb pressure and  to calculate
              expressions describing the parameters that  control REE and HFSE partitioning
              for amphibole.  One of the  premises of the proposed work is that the
              systematics of REE  and HFSE partitioning in amphibole-melt systems may be 
              similar to those for pyroxene, which were controlled by a  combination of
              factors including phase chemistry, pressure  and temperature.  Natural
              compositions, in contrast to  synthetic compositions, will be used to provide a
              data base  that is immediately relevant to natural arc basalt and  andesite
              (and possibly alkaline and MORB) systems.
