Abstract    :
              9405309  Renne   This award provides partial (45%) funding for a technical
              support position at the noble gas dating laboratory of the Berkeley
              Geochronology Center. The remaining 55% costs associated with funding this
              position will be provided by the Berkeley Geochronology Center. In addition to
              its own research program in geochronology, the noble gas dating laboratory is
              engaged in many collaborative projects with U.S. scientists for which the
              laboratory provides accurate geological dates using the argon-argon technique.
              The technical support person funded through this award will be involved in the
              laboratory's daily analytical operations as well as its developmental work.
