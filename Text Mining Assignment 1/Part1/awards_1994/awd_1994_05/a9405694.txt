Abstract    :
              The overall aim is to examine the roles that signal  transduction molecules play
              in determining cell fate in sea  urchin embryos.  The specific aims are based
              on experiments  showing that agents that alter signalling through protein 
              kinase C (PKC) cause dramatic changes in cell fate, and that  these same
              treatments cause an increase in expression of a  transcription factor
              homologous to the forkhead (FH)class of  transcription factors.  The PI has
              cloned a number of cDNAs  which encode sea urchin PKCs.  The PI intends to
              isolate  more cDNAs encoding PKC isotypes and study the temporal and  spatial
              expression of the different PKC isotypes during sea  urchin development.  In
              addition, the PI has designed  methods to alter the activity of PKC in vivo,
              and he will  use these methods to study PKC function.  These studies will  make
              use of inhibitory pseudosubstrate peptides which will  be injected into sea
              urchin eggs or individual blastomeres  of early sea urchin embryos.  The
              effects on cell fate will  be assayed using a variety of tissue specific
              markers of  differentiation.  Second, the PI will use a sea urchin  genomic DNA
              fragment encoding a FH domain to isolate cDNAs  encoding FH transcription
              factors, and he will study their  spatial expression during development and
              with and without  lithium and TPA.  The PI will also isolate genomic clones 
              containing FH genes as a first step in linking their  expression to PKC
              activity.
