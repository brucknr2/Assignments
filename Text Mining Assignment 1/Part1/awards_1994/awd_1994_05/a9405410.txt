Abstract    :
              9405410  Kelso       This award provides one-half the funding necessary to 
              acquire equipment for a magnetics laboratory to be installed  and operated in
              the Department of Computer, Geologic and  Mathematical Sciences at Lake
              Superior University. The  University is committed to providing the remaining
              funds  necessary to acquire the equipment.       The equipment consists of a
              high-temperature (i.e.,  operated at greater than 77K) superconducting
              magnetometer,  a thermal demagnetizer, an alternating field demagnetizer,  and
              a magnetic susceptibility bridge. The new equipment is  to be used primarily in
              the research projects and classroom  exercises of the Principal Investigator
              and students. These  projects will include study of  the time-temperature 
              dependence of  how rocks are magnetized in situ and  application to geological
              problems such as the magnetization  of the oceanic lithosphere and the effect
              of chemical  changes and metamorphism on the magnetic properties of  rocks. The
              Principal Investigator's department does not  offer the doctoral degree, and
              Lake Superior University is  eligible for the NSF Research in Undergraduate
              Institutions  (RUI) activity. The Principal Investigator's research and 
              teaching programs will involve significant participation by  undergraduate
              students.  ***
