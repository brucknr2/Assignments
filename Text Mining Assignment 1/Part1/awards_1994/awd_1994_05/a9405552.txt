Abstract    :
              9405552  Weldon     This research is to determine the size, extent, and timing
              of  historic and recent surface ruptures associated with the Xianshuihe  Fault
              in Sichuan Province, China.  Preliminary work by U.S. and  Chinese scientists
              reported at a conference in Chengdu, September  1990, and in the subsequent
              literature, indicate that it would be  possible to document the ages,
              distribution, and magnitude of slip  associated with recent ruptures to test
              the hypotheses of fault  behavior.  Excellent geomorphic evidence for multiple
              ruptures is  preserved in many areas, and trenches described by Chinese 
              scientists, and one briefly visited during September 1990, contain  good
              microstratigraphic evidence for the timing and size of events.   This study
              will add to the extremely limited data set for large  strike-slip ruptures so
              that we can better understand how  "characteristic" ruptures on large faults
              really are.  Such  empirical observations of fault behavior are critical for 
              prediction efforts and for understanding the underlying physics of  rupture
              processes.  This research is a component of the U.S.-P.R.C  Protocol on
              Earthquake Studies and the National Earthquake Hazard  Reduction Program.  ***
