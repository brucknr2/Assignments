Abstract    :
              9405999  Manning  The project will continue experimental studies aimed at 
              providing data with which to evaluate high pressure fluid-  rock interactions. 
              The proposed experiments will focus on  determining solubilities of enstatite +
              forsterite, diopside  + enstatite, albite + quartz, and jadeite + quartz in H2O
              at  5-25 kb and 400-900oC.  Additional experiments will  investigate the
              compositions of natural slab dehydration  fluids and fluid compositions in
              equilibrium with eclogite.  Results of this research will find application in 
              elucidating processes in  in high pressure geologic  environments such
              subducting slabs, the mantle wedge, and  Barrovian metamorphic belts.
