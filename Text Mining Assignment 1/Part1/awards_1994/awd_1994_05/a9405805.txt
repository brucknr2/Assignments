Abstract    :
              9405805  Craig       This award provides 75% of the funds required for the 
              acquisition of a microscope system for use with transmitted  and reflected
              light to be used in the rare gas isotope  laboratory, Scripps Institution of
              Oceanography at the  University of California, San Diego. The University is 
              committed to providing the remaining funds necessary for the  acquisition.     
               The microscope system is mainly to be used by  researchers working with fluid,
              glass, and crystalline  inclusions trapped in samples of basaltic rocks that
              have  been extruded from the Earth's mantle. The microscope is  needed for the
              location and identification of these small  inclusions prior to extraction of
              the rare gases (argon,  helium, and neodymium) for isotopic analysis. The 
              researchers at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography are  using the isotopic
              content of the rare gases brought up from  the mantle to understand the
              geochemical evolution of the  mantle.  ***
