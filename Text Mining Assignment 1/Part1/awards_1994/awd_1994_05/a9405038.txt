Abstract    :
              Walter Bowyer and his undergraduate students at Hobart and William Smith  
              Colleges will investigate the mechanism of Grignard reagent formation   with
              the support of this forty-two month continuing grant from the   Analytical and
              Surface Chemistry Program.  The surface of the reacting   magnesium metal will
              be characterized using photomicrography, scanning   electrochemical microscopy,
              and kinetic studies.  The goal of this   research is to develop a fundamental,
              detailed understanding of the   surface processes involved when alkyl halides
              react with metallic   magnesium to form synthetically important Grignard
              reagents.    Grignard reagents are among the most commonly utilized organic
              reagents,   however, the factors controlling the production of these species
              are not   well understood.  In this research project, designed for
              undergraduate   participation, Professor Bowyer and his students will
              characterize the   mechanism of reagent formation occuring at the surface of
              magnesium   metal.  The results from these studies will permit much better
              control of   the synthesis of these extraordinarily useful reagents that are
              employed   broadly in commercial processes.
