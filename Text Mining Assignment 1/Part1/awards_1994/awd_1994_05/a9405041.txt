Abstract    :
              Scalettar  9405041  We propose to investigate hardware and algorithmic
              bottlenecks in parallel and vector supercomputers within the context of a
              central problem in condensed matter physics and material science-monte carlo
              simulations of interacting electron systems.  This work will provide an
              evaluation of the direction parallel architectures and algorithms need to
              develop, at least for this important class of computational physics problems.
