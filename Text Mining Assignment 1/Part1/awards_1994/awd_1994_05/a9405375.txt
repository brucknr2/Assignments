Abstract    :
              9405375  Stott  The transition from Paleocene to Eocene time was one of the most
               important environmental and biological transitions in Earth  history.  PI, in
              collaboration with European colleagues, will  continue to delineate the
              Paleocene/Eocene boundary, by its  postulated carbon isotope excursion, in
              classic marine and non-  marine sections.  This boundary marks an important
              paleoclimatic,  paleoceanographic and paleobiologic shift, currently the focus
              of  interest for a large, international group of investigators.   Detailed
              sampling of sections in Paris and London basins will be  followed by isotopic
              analyses of soil carbonates, marine micro- and  macrofossils.  These data will
              be correlated with DSDP Site 550  (and 549), which provides a carbon isotope
              reference section, and  other classic Paleocene/Eocene sites, e.g., in Wyoming.
