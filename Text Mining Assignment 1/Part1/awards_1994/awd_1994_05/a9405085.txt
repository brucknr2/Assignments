Abstract    :
              Akhavan  9405085  The object of this study is to develop an advanced parallel
              spectral domain-decomposition package for large eddy simulation (LES) of
              turbulence in complex science and engineering applications.  In particular, we
              propose to implement the dynamic two-component subgrid-scale model recently
              developed at the University of Michigan into the parallel spectral domain
              decomposition code currently under development at Brown University.
