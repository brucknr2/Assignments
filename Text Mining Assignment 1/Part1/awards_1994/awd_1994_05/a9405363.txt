Abstract    :
              Abstract  9405363  The enzyme complexes of the mitochondrial electron transport
              chain  are unique. Each complex is composed of subunits encoded in two 
              different genomes, the mitochondrial and the nuclear genomes.  Cytochrome c
              oxidase (COX), the last enzyme complex in the chain  provides an ideal model
              system in which to analyze both coordinate  and tissue-specific transcriptional
              regulation of these essential  respiratory genes. The long-term goal of this
              project is to  understand the genetic regulatory mechanisms controlling both 
              tissue-specific expression and developmental regulation of  mammalian genes for
              the mitochondrial-encoded COX subunits. We will  (1) define skeletal
              muscle-specific enhancer elements in the gene  for COX subunit VIII-H by means
              of gene fusions with either the CAT  or lacZ reporter genes (2) map the sites
              of DNA-protein  interactions between nuclear proteins and tissue-specific
              enhancers  in the COX8H gene by DNAse hypersensitivity, DNAse footprinting and 
              electrophoretic mobility shift assays and determine the functional 
              significance of these interactions by gene transactivation studies  (3)
              physically map the bovine genes for the tissue-specific  isoforms of COX
              subunit VIII and (4) nap the COX VIII isoform genes  in the mouse by
              inter-specific hybrid back-crosses.  %%%  These studies will constitute the
              first comprehensive analysis of  the transcriptional regulation of a class of
              genes, the tissue-  specific respiratory genes, essential for respiratory
              function in  contractile muscle.  The results should provide insight into the 
              genetic regulation of tissue-specific subunits of an essential  multi-subunit
              enzyme complex involved in oxidative metabolism and  provide tools to enable us
              to address the function of these  isoforms in future studies.  ***
