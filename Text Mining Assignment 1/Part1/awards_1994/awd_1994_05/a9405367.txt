Abstract    :
              9405397  White  PI, U.S. collaborator Joyce Blueford, and Russian colleagues
              will  conduct sedimentological, stratigraphic, paleontological and  geochemical
              analyses of selected Cenozoic siliceous and organic-  rich deposits of Russia,
              and compare these deposits to related  units in California, and to deep-sea
              core material from the  northern Pacific.  This comparision will ultimately
              broaden our  understanding of siliceous rocks and their integral role in 
              paleoceanographic and petroleum research.
