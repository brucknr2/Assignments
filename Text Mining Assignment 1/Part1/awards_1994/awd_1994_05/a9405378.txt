Abstract    :
              This SBIR Phase II research  investigates the scale up of a novel diode-pumped
              solid-state laser suitable for materials processing.  The advantage of this
              pumping technique is that  2 micron Tm:YAG  material can be used  and that  1
              micron Nd:YAG lasers will be greatly improved.  A highly efficient laser 
              geometry is used  that  operates independent of  diode emission wavelength. 
              The side-pumped geometry will be applied to various laser materials  and
              produce power at wavelengths of both 1 and 2 microns.
