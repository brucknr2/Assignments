Abstract    :
              9405432  Helz  Much current research is directed toward understanding the
              behavior  of trace metals in anoxic aquatic environments.  These studies 
              create a need for accurate data on the stoichiometry and stability  of metal
              complexes containing reduced sulfur ligands.  Many  existing stability
              constants are uncertain at the order of  magnitude level and thus far less
              accurate than the field data to  which they are applied.  In some cases,
              especially for polysulfide  or thiol ligands, no data exist.  When data are
              available, it is  often uncertain whether the species described are mononuclear
              or  polynuclear.  This proposal request support to continue research on  the
              stabilities of metal sulfide and polysulfide complexes.  Our  approach combines
              traditional solution chemistry and EXAFS  spectroscopy.  In the coming three
              years, emphasis will be placed  on (a) resolving the controversy concerning the
              nature of arsenic  and antimony sulfide complexes (while at the same time
              exploring  the possible importance of thioarsenic and thioantimony as 
              complexing ligands for metals like Cu) (b) developing a continuous  flow
              reactor method and applying it to extend previous work on Zn  and Cd sulfide
              complexes and (c) continuing current work on the  role of thiomolybdates as
              geochemically important ligands and  determining the form of Mo in black
              shales.  In the experiments on  Cd and Zn sulfides, the possibility of
              measuring surface energies  will be explored.
