Abstract    :
              9405336  Wily  Eastern College in Pennsylvania requests support from NSF for 
              connection of its campus network to PREPnet.  PREPnet is the  midlevel network
              located in the state of Pennsylvania.  PREPnet  will provide operations
              management and information services and  it will give Eastern College
              connection to the NSFNET, a high  speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second)
              National Backbone  network.    The college needs greater functionality and
              network speed to be  able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file
              transfers  along with being able to implement a more reliable mail system. 
              Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.  This  is also a
              unique opportunity for the school to explore innovative  educational resources.
