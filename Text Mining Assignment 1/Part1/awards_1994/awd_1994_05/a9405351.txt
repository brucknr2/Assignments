Abstract    :
              9405351  Anderson      The PI will compile a global map of crustal and uppermost
              mantle  properties and test the effect of this structure on derived  properties
              of the deeper mantle.  He will use the digital seismic  data from the Landers
              earthquake, including the TERRAscope data at  the pode, to test and refine
              crustal and mantle models, and will  attempt to model the new W-phase which can
              be thought of as a  superposition of longer period high-group velocity modes or
              as a  superposition of whispering gallery phases.  Anelastic and  anharmonic
              theory will be extended and applied to bound the  temperature variation in the
              lower mantle, and a Monte Carlo  technique will be used to correlate tomography
              with other  geophysical and geochemical fields.  ****
