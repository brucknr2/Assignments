Abstract    :
              9405379  Conway       This award funds the research of Prof. John Conway in 
              geometry.  Prof. Conway will study the geometry of the Monster  group and other
              sporadic groups.  He is also interested in  geometrical problems associated
              with quantum logic.  Prof. Conway  will also continue his investigations into
              the arithmetic and  geometric properties of quadratic forms.       This is
              research in the field of number theory.  Number  theory is basically the study
              of whole numbers,  but it uses  techniques and ideas from all other parts of
              mathematics.  Prof.  Conway will study certain algebraic objects using the
              geometry  associated with them.  This geometry manifests itself through 
              sequences of integers.  Within the last half century, this type  of number
              theory has become doubly important as it has been used  to establish advances
              in computer science and electronics.      ***
