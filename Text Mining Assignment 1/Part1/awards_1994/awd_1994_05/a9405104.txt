Abstract    :
              9405104  Kelley      In this renewal, PIs will continue to test the escalation 
              hypothesis, in which biological hazards have increased through  time, and the
              adaptations to those pressures have also increased.   PIs will continue to look
              at gastropod drilling frequencies, prey  effectiveness, and predator behavior
              stereotypy based on the record  of naticid drillholes.  Recovery after a mass
              extinction is a new  focus.
