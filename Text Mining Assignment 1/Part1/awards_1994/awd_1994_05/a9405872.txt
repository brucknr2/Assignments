Abstract    :
              An experimental Special Session on exemplary current doctoral work in
              mathematics is scheduled  for the October 28-29, 1994 Central Section meeting
              of the American Mathematical Society, to  be held on the campus of Oklahoma
              State University in Stillwater, Oklahoma. At this session,  selected doctoral
              students who are completing PhDs in academic year 94-95 at doctoral programs 
              in the central section will present twenty-minute talks about their thesis work
              in progress.  All  programs will be invited to have their eligible students
              apply.  The session organizing committee  will select the presentations from
              the applicants on the basis of scientific quality, taking diversity  into
              account.  Funds are to be used to support the travel and local expenses of
              twelve of the  graduate student participants selected by the organizing
              committee to attend the meeting.
