Abstract    :
              9405326  Scholz       The mechanism of fault propagation through rocks is of 
              fundamental importance in understanding brittle deformation.   Recently, a
              mechanical model for the zone of intensified  deformation near crack tips, the
              process zone, has been developed.   This work will be an extensive field test
              of process zones intended  to characterize the nature and geometry of process
              zone in 3-D and  to determine their scaling relationship with fault scaling 
              parameters.  This study will involve describing both macro-and  microstructures
              associated with process zones, with a concentration  on the microstructures
              such as microcracks and pressure solution  surfaces.  The results will be
              tested against the present model and  the model further developed.
