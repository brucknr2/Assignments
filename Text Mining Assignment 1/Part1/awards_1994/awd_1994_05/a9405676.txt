Abstract    :
              9405676  Torgersen    Will hold a Chapman Conference in June 1994 and entitled 
              HYDROGEOLOGIC PROCESSES: BUILDING AND TESTING ATOMISTIC- TO BASIN-  SCALE
              MODELS  This conference will focus on the appropriate  questions that should be
              asked and the necessary information  exchange that should occur among
              disciplines to interface (1) model  building, (2) model testing, and (3)
              scaling of naturally occurring  hydrogeologic processes.  The outcome of this
              Chapman Conference  will provide a basis for using theory, experiments and the
              geologic  product and records of those processes at the macro- and micro- 
              scale to more fully define, develop and quantitatively evaluate the  dynamics
              of hydrogeologic processes in the Earth.  This proposal  seeks partial support
              for participant costs to hold this meeting.  ***
