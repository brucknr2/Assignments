Abstract    :
              9405461  Mijovic    This award supports cooperative research between Jovan
              Mijovic,  Polytechnic University, Brooklyn, and Francesco Bellucci,  University
              of Naples, Italy.  The subject of their research is  dielectric studies of
              reactive polymers and polymeric glasses.   The collaboration takes advantage of
              the respective strengths of  the U.S. and Italian researchers. Dr. Mijovic's
              expertise is in  the areas of chemorheology of reactive systems and structural 
              relaxations in the glassy state.  Dr. Bellucci's research has  covered the
              fundamentals of transport of water, gas, and ions  through various media, and
              the use of electrochemical impedance  spectroscopy as a fundamental probe of
              dielectric polarization.  Current interest in dielectric properties of polymers
              reflects  their growing use in printed board circuitry, electronic 
              interconnect devices, microwave assemblies for radars, solid  state batteries
              and fuel cells.    The principal objective of the proposed work is to
              investigate  reactive systems from the moment they are formulated, through 
              their reactive stage, characterized by the formation of a three-  dimensional
              network, and during subsequent behavior of these  networks in the glassy state.
               The concept of monitoring the  entire history of the network response in a
              system of precisely  defined chemical composition, from its inception, has not
              been  explored.  A comprehensive picture of dielectric properties of  reactive
              systems is expected to emerge from this study.  * * *
