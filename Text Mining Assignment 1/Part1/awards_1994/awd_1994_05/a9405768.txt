Abstract    :
              9405768  Lange  This award will support experiments to measure the denisty  and
              compressibility of hydrous silicate liquids between 900-  1600 oC and 1-20
              kbars.  Measurements will be performed on  NaAlSi3O8, KAlSi3O8, and rhyolitic
              liquids containing 1-10%  H2O and will be based on the floating and sinking of
              ultra-  pure crystalline graphite buoyancy markers.  The experiments  outlined
              will allow direct determination of the partial  molar volume of water in
              silicate melts as a function of  temperature and pressure.
