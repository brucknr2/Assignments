Abstract    :
              9405051  Jenkins       This award provides 60% of the funds required for the 
              acquisition of a powder x-ray diffractometer to be installed  and operated in
              the Department of  Geological Sciences at  the State University of New York in
              Binghamton. The  University is committed to providing the remaining funds 
              necessary for the acquisition.       Use of the modern x-ray diffractometer
              will be mainly  devoted to the research and teaching projects of the  Principal
              Investigator and colleagues in the Department of  Geological Sciences and also
              by members of the Department of  Physics. Examples of  current research
              projects include: (1)  Studies of cation disorder in natural and synthetic 
              amphiboles, (2) Mineralogy of low-grade metamorphic  reactions in layered
              silicates, (3) petrologic studies of  mineral distribution in layered igneous
              rocks, (4) Studies  of the mineralogy of  salt minerals from evaporite
              deposits,  and (5)  X-ray studies of stacking sequences in transition- 
              metal/graphite intercalation compounds to determine the  stacking sequence
              influence on their magnetic properties.  ***
