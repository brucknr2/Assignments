Abstract    :
              9405939  Aptekar    This research involves faculty and students from San Jose
              State University in collaboration with faculty and students from Kenya studying
              Kenyan street children.  The hypotheses to be tested concern the nature of the
              families of origin of the children and the relation between aspects of rapid
              social and economic change, varieties of family social structure and economic
              base and the existence of street children originating from these families.  By
              studying these issues in Kenya, where there are diverse family structures and
              different degrees of involvement in formal sector economies, the research
              addresses the effects of modernization on family structures and the
              relationship of poverty and trauma to child development.  The specific goals of
              this project are to define street children by testing procedures to establish
              their number, age, gender, and street culture in five different sites in Kenya
              (the multi-site project will be proposed after this project ends).  A
              multi-disciplinary team of anthropologists, sociologists, psychologists, and
              education specialists from the US and Kenya, with their students, will conduct
              ethnographic interviews with street children, administer structured interviews
              and psychological tests and collect physical and archival data.    This project
              is important because any theories of why homeless children exist in our own
              society must be tested comparatively to insure that the processes thought to
              cause homelessness are truly operative rather than merely correlating with
              other, unknown causal factors.  By having comparative case studies such as the
              present one, our understanding of why children end up on the streets and our
              ability to cope with them will be advanced.
