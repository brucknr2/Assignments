Abstract    :
              9405119  Leger      The PIs in this collaborative research effort will perform 
              experiments to gain an understanding of the dynamics of coupled  chemical and
              mechanical processes that occur during the deformation  and diagenesis of
              sediments under hydrothermal conditions.  Both  arkosic (labradorite and
              quartz) and clay-rich systems will be  investigated under a range of
              deformation styles and fluid access  conditions.  Post experiment measurements
              using SEM and microprobe  will analyze the solid specimens and chemical
              analyses of the  fluids will be performed.  ****
