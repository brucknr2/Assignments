Abstract    :
              9405519  Thurber    This research involves the analysis, by means of tomographic
               inversion methods, active-source seismic data collected in 1994 by  the
              separately-funded Los Angeles Region Seismic Experiment  (LARSE).  The goal of
              LARSE is to improve the understanding of  velocity heterogeneities and geologic
              structure associated with  faulting in the Los Angeles region.  The goals of
              this analysis are  1) the determination of P and S velocity structure to a
              depth of 15  km or deeper beneath the high-resolution segment of LARSE, 2) 
              location of faults as identified by velocity discontinuities, low  velocity
              zones and delineation of fault geometry to typical  hypocentral depths.  This
              research is a component of the National  Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
