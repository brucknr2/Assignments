Abstract    :
              9405853  Kelts           This award provides partial support for the
              Limnological  Research Center's core laboratory facility at the University of 
              Minnesota.  The core laboratory is a multi-user facility used by  the
              limnological research community in collecting and analyzing  lake sediment
              cores from a variety of lake environments.  The award  specifically will allow
              the LRC core laboratory to hire a  technician and to add multisensor logging
              and digital photography   to its range of tools offered to users.         The
              study of lake sediment cores contributes directly to the  analysis of past
              climate variations, and, by making available  coring equipment, core storage,
              and instrumentation for core  analysis, the core laboratory of the Limnological
              Research Center  is contributing to the U.S. research effort in Global Change.
