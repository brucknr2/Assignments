Abstract    :
              9405933  Hubbell   Previous research has measured the strength of density- and
              frequency-dependence in regulating individual tree species populations and in
              maintaining tree species diversity in Barro Colorado Island forests. The
              results of these analyses were restricted to trees >1 cm in diameter, yet this
              age class is likely to miss the important interactions that occur in the
              seedling and sapling layers of the forest. The empirical nature of this study
              will capitalize on a 50 ha plot of tropical forest that has previously been
              mapped and censused in 1982, 1985, and 1990. This study will provide the 1995
              recensus of the 50 ha plot and begin a long-term analysis of seedling and
              sapling populations.  %%%   This study will provide the first comprehensive
              analysis of density- and frequency-dependence in seedling and sapling
              populations of a tropical forest. The detailed analyses of the dynamics of
              seedlings and saplings of tropical tree species will provide valuable empirical
              data on the mechanisms that maintain tree species richness in tropical forest
              ecosystems.
