Abstract    :
              In this project of the Physical Chemistry program in the Chemistry   Division,
              Profs. M. Keil and G. Parker of the University of Oklahoma will   undertake a
              joint theoretical-experimental investigation of the dynamics   of the
              rotational energy transfer occurring in the non-reactive   scattering between
              argon atoms and hydrogen fluoride molecules, as well   as in the fundamental
              reaction of fluorine atoms with molecular hydrogen.    The principal goal is to
              measure the rotationally resolved   state-to-state cross sections for reactions
              that produce HF.      Determining the differential scattering cross sections
              for atom-molecule   pairs, with molecules in specific excited 
              rotation-vibration states is a   new and difficult undertaking.  This research
              promises to produce   important information on the dynamics of chemical
              reactions.
