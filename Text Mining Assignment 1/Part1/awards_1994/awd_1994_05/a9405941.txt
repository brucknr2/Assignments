Abstract    :
              9405941  Parvin    This research emphasizes synthesis purification, magnetic 
              extraction, and structural and magnetic characterization of carbon- 
              encapsulated materials.  The carbon-encapsulated particles of  magnetic alloys
              (iron-transition metal alloys, cobalt-transition  metal alloys,
              nickel-transition metal alloys, and iron-rich rare  earth alloy R2Fe17, where R
              is a rare earth element) are  synthesized in a standard fullerene arc chamber. 
              An efficient  method extracts the magnetic particles from nonmagnetic species 
              using interaction of magnetic moments with a magnetic field  gradient. 
              Characterization includes particle size distribution  analysis using scanning
              electron microscopy (SEM), compositional  and structural characterization using
              transmission electron  microscopy (TEM), and x-ray diffraction analysis (XRD). 
              The  magnetic nature of the materials is studied using direct  measurements of
              the magnetic moment of the particles over a wide  range of temperature and
              magnetic field.  Additional information  concerning the magnetic nature of the
              iron-containing samples is  determined in a series of Mossbauer spectroscopy
              measurements. This  grant is a collaborative research project involving San
              Jose State  University, SRI International, and E.I. duPont de Nemours. SRI 
              international is the site for synthesis, purification, and magnetic  extraction
              of the materials and XRD studies.  SEM and TEM work is  done at DuPont, and
              magnetometry and Mossbauer spectroscopy is  carried out at San Jose State
              University.  %%%  Such materials are of interest because they combine corrosion
               protection from the closed carbon polyhedra and desirable  ferromagnetic
              properties that can be tailored by the choice of  particles to be encapsulated
              and the processing conditions.  ***
