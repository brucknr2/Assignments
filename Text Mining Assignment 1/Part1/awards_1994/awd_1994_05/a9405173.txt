Abstract    :
              9405173  Rusmore       One of the most for reaching tectonic problems of
              Northwestern  US geology is the discrepancy between contrasting paleogeographic
               models suggested by paleomagnetic data (far traveled terranes) and  much
              geologic findings (more autochthonous terranes).  Similarly,  there are several
              structural elements in the Coast Mountains orogen  of western British Columbia
              and SE Alaska whose tectonic  significance is unclear.  This RUI project will
              address many of  thee issues through field work along the Douglas Channel. 
              British  Columbia that provides a natural cross-strike set of exposures.   The
              work will be directed towards answering structural questions  about the history
              of the Coast shear zone, the tectonic affinity  and structural getting of
              metamorphic rocks thought to be Nisling  terrane rocks and the relation of
              these rocks to Stikinia.  Results  will clarify many of the presently poorly
              known structural elements  in this area and will lead to resolving the question
              of whether  outboard terranes moved northward by more than 2500 km or if they 
              essentially are near where they formed.
