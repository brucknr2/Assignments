Abstract    :
              Current theories of visual processing are theories of local  responses.  Even
              models of space-variant acuity concentrate on  properties of the local
              receptive fields, with the rationalization  that the visual system is
              approximately homogeneous within any  small neighborhood.  The response of the
              entire visual field is  pieced together from models of local responses.    The
              theory of integral operators allows the experimentla study of  human acuity to
              be united with computational model is visual  processing.  Their use in this
              context leads to simpler and more  intuitive proofs of key theorems which
              relate threshold assessment  to eigenvalue problems.  At the same time,
              everyday experimental  concepts, such as threshold sensitivity, take on new
              elegance when  placed within the theory of integral operators.
