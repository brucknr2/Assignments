Abstract    :
              Fisher  9405403  Advanced computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software for
              distributed memory multicomputers will be developed to provide the resolution
              capabilities (106-107 gridpoints) and high-order accuracy required for large
              eddy simulation (LES) DG1  DG2  of turbulent flows in complex domain.  The
              choice of distributed memory parallel architectures is motivated by high
              performance and economy which derives from their intrinsic ability to exploit
              data locality.  This work will be based on the spectral element method for the
              incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, with emphasis on improving elliptic
              solver performance and increasing geometric flexibility.  Enhanced geometric
              and resolution flexibility will be achieved through implementation of
              three-dimensional nonconforming spectral element discretizations.  The software
              will have a variety of applications. The scope and complexity of the proposed
              activities will foster further research in large scale parallel computation.
