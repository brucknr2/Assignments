Abstract    :
              9405046  Reeder  The research supported by this award will examine the 
              mechanism by which surface structure influences trace  element incorporation
              into minerals during growth, with  particular emphasis on the resulting
              intracrystalline  distribution.  Minerals to be considered include apatite, 
              calcite, and topaz.  Techniques to be utilized in the study  are synchrotron
              x-ray fluorescence microanalysis, x-ray and  neutron structure refinements, and
              x-ray absorption  spectroscopy.  The results of the research program will find 
              application in geochemical studies involving partitioning  behavior and also in
              materials science and industrial  crystallization projects where surface and
              growth mechanisms  are important.
