Abstract    :
              9405261  Nicholson       The tectonic evolution of the Pacific-North America
              plate  boundary is tied to the development of several engimtic features of  the
              California margin, including large-scale rotations of the  Transverse Ranges,
              the location of several strike-slip faults and  regions of extreme crustal
              extension.  A recent tectonic model  based largely on seismic reflection data
              has been developed that,  in theory, accommodates these features.  This project
              will test  this model by investigating the relationship and interaction of 
              off-shore oceanic plates with respect to known geology of western  North
              America, taken from a variety of databases.  Results should  test the new
              model, and if successful, will result in a series of  quantitative palinspastic
              maps of the evolving Pacific- North  America plate boundary since 30ma.
