Abstract    :
              9405102  Proakis     This research will investigate and demonstrate solutions to
              known problems in indoor wireless systems.  Solutions will be demonstrated
              analytically and experimentally, at a wireless multiple-access testbed under
              development at Northeastern University.  Both the baseband transmitter files
              and acquisition attributes for this testbed are fully programmable, and the
              researcher can demonstrate novel transmission and reception techniques on
              actual radio frequency data directly in the Matlab environment.  For the
              duration of this grant, the investigator will address low-cost antenna
              diversity techniques, low-complexity demodulation schemes for dynamic fading
              channels, the localization of transmitters within the antenna field, the
              prediction of deep fades via localization, and the prediction and cancellation
              of intrabuilding interference (from office equipment and other wireless
              transmitters).  During the 24-month period, the research associate will specify
              novel multiuser communication system architectures with application to hospital
              patient monitoring and to general indoor wireless networks.  Broader
              applications will also be devised, including the development and implementation
              of multiuser detection algorithms, wavelet-based signal design, and channel
              waveform design for asynchronous multiple-access systems.  ***
