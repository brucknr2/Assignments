Abstract    :
              EAR-9405734    Elrick, Maya, University of New Mexico    GRGC:  Short-term
              paleoclimatic fluctuations expressed in Paleozoic  deep-water rhythmites    PI
              and collaborator Linda Hinnov will 1) determine whether selected  Paleozoic
              rhythmites reflect paleoclimate fluctuations or random  sedimentary processes,
              2) use spectral analysis to determine  periods of rhythmites, 3) compare
              physical and temporal  characteristics of rhythmites from varying climatic,
              tectonic, and  biologic regimes, and 4) evaluate the time scale of fluctuations
               compared to the Quaternary.
