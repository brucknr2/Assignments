Abstract    :
              9405177  Headley  The hydrogen bond basicity ability of structurally different  
              sulfides will be determined in an Argon matrix and from   theoretical
              calculations. From infrared spectra of selected   sulfur bases and
              4-fluorophenol, the vibrational modes of   the hydrogen bonded complexes will
              be assigned based on   comparisons of the spectra of deuterated and
              undeuterated   complexes. The relative wave number displacements (DnO-H)   for
              the O-H stretching of 4-fluorophenol caused by a   hydrogen bond to the
              sulfides will be used to represent the   hydrogen-bond basicity of structurally
              different sulfides.   Ab initio molecular orbital calculations will be used to 
               predict spectra for the hydrogen bonded complexes after   calibration to
              experimental data.     This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports
              the   work of Professor Alan Headley at Texas Tech University.   Hydrogen bonds
              are weak bonds that form between a basic atom   and a proton donor. This type
              of bonding is considerable   importance in molecules of biological interest. In
              this   research project, hydrogen bonding between sulfur atoms and   a proton
              donor will be studied by infrared spectroscopy in   conjunction with
              theoretical calculations. A hydrogen-bond   basicity scale will be determine
              for various sulfur   containing groups in molecules.
