Abstract    :
              9405254  PICKLES       This research will investigate the production of new 
              political geographies in contemporary Bulgaria as that nation  undergoes its
              transition from state socialism. Key to these new  political geographies are
              the changing relations between  political institutions, actors, and interests
              operating at  different geographic scales (national/regional/local). This 
              includes the distribution of political powers between national,  regional, and
              local levels of governance. Also important for the  new Bulgarian political
              geographies are the different mechanisms  which are being developed at
              different spatial scales for  apportioning, legitimizing, and utilizing
              political power.  Utilizing ethnographic research techniques this research
              program  will develop a detailed case study of local government change in 
              Burgas obstina (county), Bulgaria. In-depth interviews, focus  groups, survey
              research, and archival sources will be used in the  research.       This
              research will contribute new insights into the  democratization process in
              Eastern Europe and will add to the  literature in both geography and political
              science approaches to  democratization. As a doctoral dissertation research
              improvement  award, this project will also provide support to enable a 
              promising student to establish a strong independent research  career.  ***
