Abstract    :
              9405537  Vermeij       PI will examine evolution and function of labral spines
              in  gastropods, Oligocene to Recent, including experiments on modern 
              gastropods and systematics of the studied groups.  Many attributes  of
              organisms are interpretable as adaptations that enhance an  individual's
              competitive ability or defensive performance; under  what conditions do such
              adaptations evolve and spread?  This study  will test the hypothesis that
              enemy-related adaptations of marine  species mainly arose in lineages found in
              warm, productive waters.  The work will contribute to an understanding of
              biological  escalation and serve as an example of the integrated approach to 
              answering fundamental questions in evolutionary biology, and of the 
              macroeconomic perspective on the history of life.
