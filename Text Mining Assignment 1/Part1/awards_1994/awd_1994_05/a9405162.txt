Abstract    :
              9405162   Wiltschko       In many fold and thrust belts faults are found more
              commonly  in weak lithologies such as mudrocks.  Despite this, little is  known
              about the micromechanical behavior of mudrock, principle  because of the very
              small grain size and the difficulty of  performing laboratory experiments with
              the material this project is  designed to determine the characters and
              mechanics of mudrock  deformation is natural, small displacement, thrust fault
              zones  using a combinations of observation techniques ta several scales.  
              Results will be compared to data sets on mudrock fabrics that are  the result
              of burial diagenesis, and with a set of experimented  deformation of mudrock
              samples.  This work is expected to help  understand in a more quantitative way
              the mechanical properties of  natural thrust fault zones.
