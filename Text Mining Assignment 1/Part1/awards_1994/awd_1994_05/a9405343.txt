Abstract    :
              9222933  Reddy    This award provides funds to permit Dr. D.V.  Reddy,
              Department of Ocean Engineering, Florida  Atlantic University, and Dr. V.
              Ramakrishnan,  Department of Civil Engineering, South Dakota  School of Mines
              and Technology, to conduct with  Dr. P. Paramasivam, Department of Civil 
              Engineering, National University of Singapore,  a workshop on the durability of
              concrete with  particular emphasis on the marine environment.   Nine U.S.
              participants and at least an equal  number from Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia,
              and  Brunei will be selected by an advisory panel of  experts in the field of
              the workshop.  This  workshop is a satellite conference for the 4th 
              International Conference on Structural Failure,  Durability, and Retrofitting
              which will be held  in Singapore, July 14 and 15, 1993.  The magnitude of the
              durability problem is  considerable.  In the concrete infrastructure  estimated
              at $6 trillion, current replacement  and repair requirements caused by
              inadequate  durability is conservatively estimated at  several billion dollars.
               The workshop will  focus on the use of new supplementary cementing  materials,
              corrosion inhibitors, improved mix  design, rebar types, and construction 
              techniques.  The collaborators are well known  researchers in this field.      
              This project is relevant to the objectives of  the Science in Developing
              Countries Program  which seeks to increase the level of  cooperation between
              U.S. and developing country  scientists and engineers through the exchange  of
              scientific information, ideas, skills, and  techniques and through
              collaboration on  problems of mutual interest and benefit.  ***
