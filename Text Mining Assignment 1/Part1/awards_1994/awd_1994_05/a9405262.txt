Abstract    :
                    94-05262  Williams    The five participating universities in the Southern
              California region, in cooperation with the California Engineering Foundation,
              the California Manufacturing Technology Center, and the Los Angeles County
              Economic Development Corporation, will form the Southern California Coalition
              for Education in Manufacturing Engineering to develop outstanding,
              well-integrated, practice-oriented, ABET-accredited undergraduate programs in
              manufacturing engineering in this area containing a high concentration of
              manufacturing industries.  The program is expected to play a significant role
              in the reindustrialization of the Los Angeles area.  The Coalition will focus
              on the long-term, systemic reform of undergraduate manufacturing engineering
              education across the curricula, enhancing existing manufacturing-related
              baccalaureate degree programs and creating new degree programs and degree
              options related to manufacturing that emphasize this integrated approach
              focusing on Integrated Product Development.  These efforts will include
              curricula modernization, developing closer ties with industry, exchanges of
              instructors, utilization of  active professionals working in industry to teach
              classes, use of industry facilities, university/industry team teaching, and
              promoting knowledge transfer from industry to academia and greater awareness of
              manufacturing engineering as a challenging discipline.  These program will
              emphasize quality as a key element in the conduct and administration of the
              academic program and quality concepts integrated throughout the curricula.  ***
