Abstract    :
              This project, supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic
              Chemistry Program,  is concerned with studies of compounds that contain
              metal-metal multiple bonds.  Objectives  include 1) the synthesis of new
              complexes that contain M-M multiple bonds, 2) further studies  of the
              underlying factors governing reactivity of M-M multiply bonded compounds, 3) 
              exploration of applications of M-M multiply bonded compounds in catalytic
              reactions and in  stoichiometric organic transformations, and 4) incorporation
              of M-M multiply bonded  compounds in macromolecular phases such as
              one-dimensional polymers and liquid crystalline  materials.  The latter may be
              of interest for molecular design of materials having potentially  interesting
              electrical, magnetic and optical properties.    Whereas the existence of
              multiple bonds in carbon, nitrogen and oxygen compounds has been  recognized
              for many decades, recognition of the existence of metal-metal multiple bonds is
              of  much more recent origin.  Consequently the fundamental chemistry of
              compounds that contain  metal-metal multiple bonds is poorly developed.  The
              primary objective of this project is to  expand our knowledge of the structural
              and reactivity properties of compounds that contain  metal-metal bonds,
              particularly with respect to possible applications in the catalysis of organic 
              reactions and in the preparation of new polymers and liquid crystalline
              materials.  The latter may  prove to be useful in the development of new
              materials having novel electrical, magnetic or  optical properties.
