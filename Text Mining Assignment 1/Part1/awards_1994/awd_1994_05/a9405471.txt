Abstract    :
              9405471  Kienle  Thousands of people around the world live at the bases of 
              active silicic domes and dome complexes.  This project is to  develop a
              quantitative three-dimensional interior view of an  actively growing endogenous
              dome complex.  The PIs plan to  tomographically image P-wave velocities through
              the central  dome complex of Augustine Volcano.  The volume to be sampled  with
              some 7,000 seismic rays is about 1km3 (500 m radius)  around the vent.  The
              experimental design afforded by  working near the summit of a volcano is unique
              in the world  of geotomography, and the suite of illumination angles to be 
              acquired is more similar to those employed in medical  tomography than those
              generally used in geophysics.  Expected resolution will less than fifty meters.
               This is a  first attempt in the U.S. to gain detailed knowledge of the 
              interior structure and growth processes of a readily  accessible and active
              endogenous dome complex.
