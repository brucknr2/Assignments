Abstract    :
              9405050  Kesler  This is a preliminary study of the Vergenoeg iron-fluorite 
              deposit in South Africa.  Vergenoeg consists if fluorite and  iron oxides and
              is closely associated with silicic extrusive  rocks.  Research a Vergenoeg will
              attempt to answer two  questions.  The first question involves the nature of
              fluid  phases present during formation of the deposits, which  should clarify
              the relation between silicate and iron oxide  magmas and the possible role of
              volatile phases(s) in  causing the heavy iron oxide phase to extrude.  The
              second  question is why the immiscible iron oxide phase separated  from the
              silicate magma, if indeed it did.  We plan to map  these rocks, verify the
              stratigraphic position of iron ore  in the sequence and then look for any
              changes in the oxygen  isotope composition of the silicic rocks, which might
              relate  to introduction of ground (e.g. meteoric) water.
