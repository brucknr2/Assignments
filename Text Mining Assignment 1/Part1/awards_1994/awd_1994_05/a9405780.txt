Abstract    :
              9405780  Banks  The primary objective of this proposal is to use a genetic
              approach to understand how antheridiogen and abscisic acid govern the sex of
              the gametophyte of Ceratopteris.  At least some key regulatory genes involved
              in sex determination have been identified by generating and characterizing
              mutations that alter the normal sexual phenotype.  A hypothetical model of how
              these genes interact in a regulatory hierarchy has been proposed.  One
              objective of the proposed research is to continue with the genetic,
              morphological genes and physiological analysis of these mutants in order to
              understand the wild type functions of these genes and to further test and
              modify the proposed model of gene interaction.   %%%  Gametophytes of the fern
              Ceratopteris richardii are either hermaphroditic or male.  The primary
              sex-determining signal in this and many other ferns is antheridiogen a
              gibberellin-like pheromone that is secreted by the hermaphroditic gametophyte
              and promotes male development of other sexually undetermined juvenile
              gametophytes.  The plant hormone abscisic acid blocks the antheridiogen
              response.  How sex is determined in plants is an important developmental
              question whose answer many ultimately have practical applications in
              agriculture and plant breeding.  The proposed studies will provide a basic
              understanding of the genes involved in sex determination, and will also be of
              value in understanding how plant cells are coordinated to maintain a single
              sexual developmental fate, and how the sexual developmental fate of cells
              within an organism can change to adapt to changes in the environment.  ***
