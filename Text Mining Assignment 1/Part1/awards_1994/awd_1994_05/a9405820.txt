Abstract    :
              9405820  Furlong      The PIs will incorporate laboratory derived grain growth
              laws in a numerical study to determine the evolution of the lithospheric mantle
              consistent with the observed recrystallization data for the Ronda peridotite in
              the Betic Cordillera.  This study will advance the understanding of the
              processes that occurred in the upper mantle of the Western Mediterranean during
              the late Mesozoic and Tertiary, and by analogy in the mantle of other
              convergent/extensional regions.  ****
