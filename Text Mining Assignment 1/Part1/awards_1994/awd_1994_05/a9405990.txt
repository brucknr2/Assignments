Abstract    :
              Babcock  9405990  The Chengjiang Biota is the oldest known fossil assemblage of 
              exceptionally preserved organisms in the world, including soft-  bodied and
              shell-bearing animals, as well as marine plants.  This  assemblage is a unique
              window into the history of early metazoan  evolution.  In collaboration with
              Chinese colleagues, PI will 1)  complete systematic and comparative studies of
              the organisms, 2)  determine biogeographic affinities of the organisms, 3)
              describe  the small shelly fossils, 4) interpret aspects of preservation of 
              the fossils, and 5) describe and interpret associated trace  fossils.
