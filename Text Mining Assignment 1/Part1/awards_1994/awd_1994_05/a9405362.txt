Abstract    :
              9405362  Dove  This research will elucidate the rates and mechanisms by  which
              aluminum interacts with silica surfaces.  Specifically  it will quantify the
              kinetics of quartz dissolution in  characterized aluminum-bearing solutions and
              relate this  kinetic information to in situ observations of reaction  processes
              occurring at the mineral surface in aqueous  solutions.  This work is possible
              due to the development of  techniques that directly measure mineral-solution
              reaction  rates to 300oC (MFR) and techniques that directly observe  reaction
              processes occurring at the mineral surface in  aqueous solutions (SFM). Results
              of the study will find  application in botn mineral-water geochemical systems
              in  both low temperature and hydrothermal environments.
