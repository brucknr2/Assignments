Abstract    :
              9405836  Haimson      The PI will conduct laboratory experiments on borehole
              breakouts  and core disking under far-field boundary conditions and stress 
              paths most closely simulating real field situations.  Tests will be  carried
              out on a granite and a sandstone.  Samples will be  carefully characterized
              microstructurally for failure mechanisms.   The net result will be a more
              realistic simulation of the two  related phenomena, a better understanding of
              the strength criteria  leading to core and borehole failure, and practical
              conclusions  regarding the relationships of breakouts and core disks to in situ
               stress magnitudes in terms of working models and calibrated  numerical models
              for each of the two rock types.  ****
