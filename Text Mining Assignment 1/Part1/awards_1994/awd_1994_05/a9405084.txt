Abstract    :
              Carey  9405084  This research deals with the analysis and numerical solution of
              nonlinear systems of hyperbolic transport equations.  The equations are to be
              solved using a generalized Galerkin finite element method, with additional
              numerical dissipation for enhancing stability and capturing solution
              discontinuities.
