                                        ABSTRACT    York, Donald  AST-9405243    This project
              will produce a detailed digital photometric map  of half the northern sky to
              about 23rd magnitude.  This map  will be used to select about a million
              galaxies and 100,000  quasars for which high-resolution spectra will be
              obtained  with the same wide- field special-purpose telescope.  The  imaging
              survey will also be used to produce a catalog in  five colors of all the
              detected objects, about 108 galaxies  and a similar number of stars, and a
              million quasar  candidates.  The survey will then be completed over a five- 
              year period after an initial test year.    The imaging data will be assembled
              into a high-resolution  atlas and a lower resolution map of the whole area and
              those  two data sets and the spectra will be published in digital  form and
              made available in a timely fashion to the whole  community.    The scientific
              value of such a set of data is vast, and  applications range from critical
              investigations of large-  scale structure in three dimensions to the
              relationships of  galaxies with their environment to the faint-end luminosity 
              function of disk dwarf stars.  ***
