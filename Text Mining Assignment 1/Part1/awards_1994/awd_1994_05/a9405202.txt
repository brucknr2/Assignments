Abstract    :
              This research provides the foundation for the creation of a  graphical reasoning
              congruent interface for an experimental  authoring system that provides a
              powerful, flexible, reasoning-  congruent tool for behavioral researchers in
              academic, commercial  and clinical settings.  The six objectives of Phase II
              are:   tracking the reasoning of behavioral scientists implementing 
              experimental procedures in the Graphical Experiment Specification  Interface
              (GESI); determining the effectiveness of goal-tree  prompted support of
              experimental problem solving; investigating  methods to support behavioral
              researchers' ability to use,  conceptualize the debug code; investigating
              debugging aids to  improve experimental generation efficiency and accuracy; 
              determining the real time accuracy of device handler based timing  across
              platforms; and researching and prototyping specialized  hardware for refresh
              rate monitoring, luminance/chromaticity  measurement, and electronic
              tachistoscopic display.  The project  will develop a prototype GESI interface
              and carry out extensive  behavioral experiments addressing the objectives
              above.  The  tests and revisions of GESI will evolve a new approach to 
              authoring behavioral research that is expected to substantially  improve the
              efficiency, flexibility and accuracy of behavioral  research.  The results will
              provide the basis for a commercial  authoring system that is likely to impact
              thousands of  laboratories world-wide within a few years.
