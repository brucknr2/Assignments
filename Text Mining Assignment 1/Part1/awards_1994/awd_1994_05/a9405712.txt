Abstract    :
                     9405712  Netting  Thiq project supports the research and training of a
              cultural  anthropologist from the University of Arizona.  As part of a  project
              studying peasant agricultural production in Nigeria, the  investigator, a
              senior professor, will study the use of  Geographic Information Systems,
              mapping software, and the  analysis of remote sensing imagery at Indiana
              University.  The  research questions involve explaining how peasant farmers 
              exploited a newly farmed region in Nigeria with traditional hoe  farming
              technologies, what their economic efficiencies are, and  how they maintain food
              self-sufficiency as well as market  production.  The learning process will rely
              mainly on analysis of  three Landsat scenes spanning a number of years using
              ERDAS (an  imaging software), three series of aerial photographs from 1963, 
              1972, and 1978, and ARCINFO (a GIS program).  The integration of  ethnographic
              information with remote sensing is still  experimental and innovative, rather
              than routine, for social  scientists.  The training will take place at the
              Center for  Training and Research on Global Environmental Change at Indiana 
              University.     This project is important because it strengthens the scientific
               expertise of American social scientists in this new technology at  the same
              time that the training involves dealing with critically  important research
              questions involving food self-sufficiency in  sub-Saharan Africa.
