Abstract    :
              9405366  Cashman       The basic premise of plate tectonics that plates more as
              rigid  bodies with deformation occurring only at boundaries between plates  is
              violated locally within continents, as demonstrated by the  existence of broad
              zones of diffuse strain.  This study intra-plate  strain focuses on the
              northern Walker Lane in the Basin and Range  province of the Western United
              States.  Prior work has delineated  fault-bounded blocks, identified units that
              will yield useful  paleomagnetic results and documented the orientation and
              sense of  slip an major faults, some of which are nearly orthogonal to each 
              other.  This work will test for vertical-axis rotations of the  identified
              blocks and will develop a kinematic model of this  example of intra-plate
              strain including block rotations.  Results  will also provide insight into the
              relationship between  intracontinental strain nd plate-boundary interactions.
