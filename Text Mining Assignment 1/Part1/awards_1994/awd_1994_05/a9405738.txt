Abstract    :
              9405738  Fechheimer     Cell movements such as phagocytosis, chemotaxis, and 
              cytokinesis require precise control of the assembl of actin  filaments into
              either randomly gelled networks or highly  polarized bundles.  Formation of
              these cross-linked actin  structures is mediated by actin cross-linking
              proteins.  This project focuses on the structure and function of the 
              Dictyostelium 30,000 dalton actin bundling protein, one of  eight actin
              cross-linking proteins present in Dictyostelium.  The binding sites for actin
              and calcium ion, and the  parameters controlling the formation of either actin
              gels or  bundles will be investigated.  The molecular mechanisms by  which the
              30 kD protein is recruited to the phagocytic cup  during ingestion of food, the
              cleavage furrow during  cytokinesis, and sites of cell to cell contact in
              developing  cells will be investigated.  The function of the 30 kD  protein in
              cell structure and movement in Dictyostelium will  be probed using gene
              disruption by homologous recombination  to create cells lacking the 30 kD actin
              bundling protein.  This work will promote our understanding of molecular 
              mechanisms of cell movements essential to the growth and  division of
              eucaryotic cells.  Significance also derives  from probing the apparent
              redundancy of function of actin  cross-linkng proteins.  %%%  Cell movements,
              such as phagocytosis, locomotion,  cytokinesis, morphogenetic transformations
              accompanying  cellular differentiation are essential to the life of  eucaryotic
              organisms.  Actin microfilaments contribute to  the control of cell shape and
              generation of mechanical force  for cell movements.  The properties of actin in
              cells must  be explained from the structure and chemistry of actin and  the
              properties of actin binding proteins.  The conservation  of actin binding
              proteins throughout the eucaryotes provides  strong evidence for the
              significance of these proteins as  regulators of actin utilization by cells.  
              Studies of the  structures and functions of these protein s will provide 
              important insights into the control of cell shape and  motility in eucaryotes. 
              In addition, understanding of the  molecular basis for actin microfilament
              assembly and  organized supra-assembly is a critical prerequisite to the 
              exploitation of cellular structures and biomolecular  machines by materials
              scientists and nanofabrication  engineers.  ***
