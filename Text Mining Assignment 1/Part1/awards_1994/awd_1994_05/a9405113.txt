Abstract    :
              Hale, Penn State  9405113         The objective of this research is to identify
              and describe the  major sources of atmospheric electromagnetic energy in the
              region  of its highest spectral density.  In addition to known sources of 
              slowly varying lightning currents (e.g. "continuing currents") and  turbulent
              space charge, two other lightning-related sources have  been identified:  the
              "ULF" mechanism whose waveshape is controlled  by the middle atmosphere
              conductivity profile, and "slow tails"  which arguably contains most of the
              "external" energy due to  lightning.  The theory proposed here is approximately
              verified by  a computer calculation, but is still subject to theoretical, 
              computer, and experimental verification.  This research's goal is  to determine
              which mechanism is dominant in the Schumman resonance  (SR) range, as SR
              measurements have been suggested as an indicator  of global change.
