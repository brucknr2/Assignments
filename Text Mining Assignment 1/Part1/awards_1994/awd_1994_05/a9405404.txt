Abstract    :
              9405404  Bebout  This award will support a detailed ion microprobe study of 
              trace element mobility during subduction zone metamorphism.  The research will
              provide fundamental observations regarding  the partitioning of various trace
              elements (B, Be, Li, Cs,  Rb, Sr, Ba, Ce, U, Zr, Nb, Y) among minerals in the
              Catalina  Schist, California, which spans a wide range of P-T  conditions
              (300-750oC, 5-11 Kb).  An understanding of the  magnitude and mechanisms of
              compositional modification of  subducted rocks is essential to unraveling the
              complex,  fractionated trace element signatures in arc volcanic rocks.
