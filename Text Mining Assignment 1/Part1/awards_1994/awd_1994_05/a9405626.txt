Abstract    :
              9405626  Anastasio       Ambiguity exists as to the extent and scale of volume
              strain  associated with cleavage development.  Geochemical and geometric 
              methods commonly produce differing measures of strain in the same  formation. 
              This project will examine folds with variable cleavage  development in the Lost
              River Range, Idaho.  Strain will be  measured both chemically and
              geometrically.  Results will provide  independent estimates of strain and help
              resolve the several  different hypotheses for the conservation or mobility of
              various  ions in pore waters.
