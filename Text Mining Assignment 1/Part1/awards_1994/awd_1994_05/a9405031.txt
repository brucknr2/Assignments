Abstract    :
              Rebbi  9405031  We propose here a research program involving the application of
              the most advanced computational techniques to studies of theoretical physics. 
              The focus will be of three major areas; numerical methods for particle physics
              simulations, QCD simulations, and  phase separation and surface tension at low
              temperature.
