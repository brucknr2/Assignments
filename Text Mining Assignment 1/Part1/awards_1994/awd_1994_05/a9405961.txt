Abstract    :
              9405961  Abstract  This proposal describes experiments that will generate a
              large set  of mapping markers for Arabidopsis thaliana. Each marker will 
              correspond to a mapped DNA fragment that contains an informative  polymorphism
              for the restriction endonucleases AluI or Sau3A. This  collaborative project
              will have the following goals: (1) to clone  DNA fragments that contain the
              desired polymorphisms by RFLP and  genomic subtraction, (2) to sequence the
              clones and synthesize PCR  primers that will amplify the entire fragment, (3)
              to determine  which of the amplified products contain the desired
              polymorphisms,  (4) to use GenBank information to generate additional CAPS (co-
               dominant, cleaved amplified polymorphic sequences), (5) to map each  of the
              CAPS using DNA from a recombinant inbred Columbia X  Landsberg erecta
              population, and (6) to develop methods that will  allow many genes to be mapped
              in an efficient manner.  ***  This work will generate a large set of mapping
              markers for the  model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. The sequences of the clones
              and  of useful primers, as they are identified, will be provided to the 
              community and efforts will be made to arrange for a commercial firm  to
              synthesize sets of primes as inexpensive "mapping kits". If  successful, this
              work should make mapping of any gene from either  the Columbia or the Landsberg
              ecotype much, much faster and much  less expensive.  %%%
