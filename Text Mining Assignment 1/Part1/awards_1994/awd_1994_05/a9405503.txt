Abstract    :
              9405503  Halliday       This award provides partial funding to support a 
              technician assigned to assist with the operation and  maintenance of the
              Radiogenic Isotope Geochemistry  Laboratory in the Department of Geological
              Sciences at the  University of Michigan.  The technician will be responsible 
              for maintaining the electronic and mechanical operation of  two multicollector
              thermal ionization mass spectrometers. In  addition, he will also aid in the
              installation and  development of laser sources for a newly designed 
              inductively-coupled plasma magnetic sector multicollector  spectrometer. The
              research and graduate teaching  applications of the Radiogenic Isotope
              Geochemistry  Laboratory include studies of crustal fluid flow, silicic  magma
              systems, mantle geochemistry, paleoceanography, and  arc tectonics.  ***
