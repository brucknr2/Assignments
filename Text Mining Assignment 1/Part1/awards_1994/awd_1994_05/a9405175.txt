Abstract    :
              9405175  John       Magmatic intrusions are commonly associated with major 
              continental extensions, however the causal relationship between  them are
              poorly understood.  This study will focus on an area in  the southern Basin and
              Range province where a combinations of good  exposure and large geophysical
              anomalies offer the prospect of  placing constraints on the relationship
              between extension and  plutonism.  This work will obtain geometric data or the
              plutonic  rocks and the rocks will be dated by several techniques.  The 
              petrogenesis of the plutonic rocks will be studied using major  trace and REE
              chemistry.  Combined with extensive regional data,  these new data will allow a
              vigorous correlation between  continental extension, middle crustal
              magmatisms/plutonism and the  documented geophysical anomalies.
