Abstract    :
              9405716  Ghazi       This award provides one-half the funding required for  the
              acquisition of an inductively-coupled plasma mass  spectrometer system (ICP-MS)
              to be installed and operated in  the Department of Geology at the Georgia State
              University.  The University is committed to providing the remaining funds 
              necessary for the acquisition of the equipment. The  instrument is to be used
              for trace and ultra-trace elemental  and isotopic ratio analysis. It will be
              used by the  Principal Investigator and colleagues at the Georgia State 
              University and will be operated and managed in order to  provide access
              regionally to other qualified researchers  needing a rapid and accurate method
              of multi-element  analysis. Specific research projects requiring the 
              capability of the ICP-MS include: (1) trace and rare earth  element
              determination of fluid inclusions with applications  to processes of
              hydrothermal alteration and the formation of  ore deposits, (2) studies of
              water chemistry (stream flow  and groundwater) within the Piedmont Province,
              (3) trace  element analysis of human bone to reconstruct paleodiets,  and (4)
              other geochemical research. The instrument will also  be incorporated in the
              teaching of the Geology Department at  Georgia State University.  ***
