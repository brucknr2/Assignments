Abstract    :
              9405078  Johnson       During a rapid-response cruise in October 1993 the
              principal  investigators conducted preliminary magnetic, gravity, and rock 
              sampling of the newly erupted flow and adjacent regions on the  Juan de Fuca
              ridge.  A continuation of the time-series  investigation of the new lava flow
              is proposed with 12 ALVIN  dives in 1994 and six dives in 1995.  This project
              would:  (1)  repeat the 1993 survey lines over the new flow, (2) remeasure the 
              fluid vents to establish a cooling rate, (3) conduct a complete  magnetic and
              gravity survey of the lava flow and dike area, (4)  place bottom magnetometers
              on the newly erupted flow area to  determine the cooling/alteration rates, and
              (5) conduct  laboratory experiments on the returned rock samples.  ***
