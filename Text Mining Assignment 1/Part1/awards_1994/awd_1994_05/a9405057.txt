Abstract    :
              9405057  Wesnousky      The PIs will measure and analyze the signature of
              isostatic rebound  recorded in the preserved and deflected shorelines of the
              most  recent high-stand of late-Pleistocene Lake Lahontan, twice the  second
              largest pluvial lake in the western hemisphere and situated  on the edge of the
              Great Basin.  They will integrate geological  observations with physical
              principles to ultimately arrive at a  measure of the effective elastic
              thickness of the lithosphere and  the viscosity of the upper mantle material
              below.  ****
