Abstract    :
              9405315  Margaziotis  A study of few nucleon systems using electron-induced
              knockout  reactions will be carried out at MIT-Bates and CEBAF. The work at 
              MIT includes new studies of the out-of-plane behavior of the  reaction. The
              CEBAF effort will be concentrated at the Hall A  facility, and a high power
              cryogenic target is being constructed  by CSULA for use in the experiments
              there.  ***
