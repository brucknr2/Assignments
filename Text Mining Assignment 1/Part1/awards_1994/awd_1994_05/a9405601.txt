Abstract    :
              9405601  El Zarki        The goal of this research is to propose/recommend
              enhanced  service options for high bit rate video applications to improve 
              their transmission over ATM-based BISDN.  To do that the  researchers will
              study the encoding process in detail to understand  better the underlying
              characteristics of the service.  The focus is  on the newly emerging standard
              MPEG II.  MPEG II encompasses a very  complex encoding process that
              incorporates several different  options.  The impact of these options on the
              transmission of video  data over an ATM network has not yet been studied.  The
              research   plan involves studying these different encoding options in detail 
              and then investigating network access and control schemes for the  transmission
              of packetized video data.  The research will include  1) the investigation of
              different coding and error recovery options  for high bit rate video services
              and 2) the study of the source  characteristics and investigation of network
              control and access  schemes for a variety of video services for transport over 
              ATM-based networks.  ***
