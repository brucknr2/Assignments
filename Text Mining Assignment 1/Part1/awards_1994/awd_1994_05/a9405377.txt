Abstract    :
              9405377  deDoncker  Numerical integration has many applications in various areas
              of  science and engineering.  Computationally intensive multiple  integrals
              arise in areas such as atomic and nuclear physics,  statistics and the analysis
              of sensory data.  This project  involves the design, analysis and development
              of a set of coarse  grain parallel and distributed algorithms for multivariate 
              numerical integration.    The main focus is on adaptive integration strategies
              layered over  a system for distributed queue management.  Implementations are 
              targeted to loosely coupled systems.  Adaptive integration is  used as the main
              tool for integrals over regions of low to  moderate dimension.  The queue
              management incorporates the  insertion and deletion of subregions (tasks) into
              and from the  distributed task pool while retaining balanced or approximately 
              balanced loads in the local queues.  It will be adapted to the  problem as well
              as the types of processors and the speed of  communications in the loosely
              coupled system.  For low  dimensionality special attention will be paid to the
              use of  (near) optimal degree rules and techniques dedicated to the  treatment
              of specific integration problems such as singularities  or particular weight
              functions.  Number theoretic methods will be  included for high dimensions,
              irregular regions or erratic  function behavior.  ***
