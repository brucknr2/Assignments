Abstract    :
              9405579  Heinz      The PI will perform laser heating and Brillouin scattering 
              experiments on a range of materials.  He will revisit the melting  behavior of
              perovskite and Fe using his new thermal analysis  technique to provide better
              constraints on the thermal structure of  the deep Earth.  He will also
              determine elastic velocities in  several silicates, oxides and alkali halides
              in polycrystalline  form.  These experiments, coupled with seismic
              observations, will  permit a better understanding of the deep structure and
              composition  of the Earth.  ****
