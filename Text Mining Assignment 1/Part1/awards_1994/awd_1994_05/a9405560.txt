Abstract    :
              9405560  Patrick       The Brooks Range of Alaska is a major collisional belt
              that  contains a metamorphic core of high pressure/low temperature rocks.   It
              is thought that these blueschist and greenschist facies rocks in  the
              metamorphic core resulted form a mid-Mesozoic collision between  a north-facing
              island arc and an older passive continental margin.   The P.I.'s recent work in
              the area has shown that a proposed major  thrust in the schist belt of the
              Central Brooks Range is in fact a  stratigraphic contact and there is evidence
              to suggest that the  bulk deformation was mostly contractional, rather than
              extensional  as proposed by other workers.  This project will examine the 
              petrology, structure and geochronology of the transition between  the internal
              metamorphic zone and the external zone of the Brooks  Range.  It will
              investigate the links between the internal and  external zones and examine the
              contributions of extension and  contraction during the collisional orogenic
              event.  The results of  this work will be broadly applicable to all major
              orogenic belts.
