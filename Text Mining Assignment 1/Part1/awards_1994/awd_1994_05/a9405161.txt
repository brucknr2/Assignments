Abstract    :
              Hayes  9405161  The proposal research will focus on obtaining accurate
              predictions of the molecular spectra of open-shell van der Waals clusters such
              as X-OH, X-SH and X-CdCH3, where X may be Ne, Ar. or in some cases one of the
              other rare gas atoms.  The goal of this research is to investigate whether this
              basic approach, which is very efficient in an MPP environment for
              two-dimensional applications, can be extended to molecular systems with
              additional degrees of freedom.
