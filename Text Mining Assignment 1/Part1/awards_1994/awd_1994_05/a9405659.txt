Abstract    :
              9405659  Porter       Neotectonic studies can provide deformational data on 
              intermediate geologic time scales between historic measurements and  the
              geologic record as shows by bedrock geology.  This project will  examine a
              variety of neotectonic features a long the Olympic coast  of Washington where
              reconnaissance studies have indicated broad  cost-parallel warping related to
              the development of accretionary  wedge structures.  Rates of deformation will
              be calculated using  stratigraphic and chronological data, and will be used to 
              differentiate between elastic and permanent deformation.  Results  will be of
              considerable importance to models of accretionary  tectonics and the interplay
              between sea level and coastal land form  deformation.
