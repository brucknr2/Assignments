Abstract    :
              Abstract  9405746  Apoptosis or programmed cell death is a general phenomenon
              which  occurs in the development of many cell types in many organisms.  
              Anti-CD3 antibody (antibody specific for the T-cell receptor  complex) can
              induced apoptosis in mouse T cell hybridomas and  immature T cells form the
              thymus but not in mature T cells from the  spleen.  We recently showed that a
              high level of protein and mRNA  of an orphan steroid receptor Nur77 correlates
              with the activation  induced apoptosis of mouse T cell  hybridomas and immature
               thymocytes.  Introduction of a dominant negative Nur77 into T cell  hybridomas
              protected the cells from activation induced apoptosis.   Transcription of Nur77
              gene reflects the apoptotic state of the  cells; a high level of Nur77
              transcription is observed in apoptotic  T cell hybridomas, whereas only
              transient transcription of Nur77 is  detected in activated growing T cells. 
              Glucocorticoid can rescue  T cell hybridomas from activation induced apoptosis
              and at the same  time, represses the induction of Nur77 gene transcription. 
              This  effect is manifested through a calcium ionophore responsive  element,
              which is also essential in maintaining a high level of  Nur77 transcription
              during apoptosis.  In this project we plan:   (1) To characterize this Nur77
              promoter element essential for the  sustained transcription during activation
              induced apoptosis and  responsiveness to the glucocorticoid suppressive effect;
               (2) To  perform in vivo studies of the relationship between Nur77 promoter 
              and apoptosis using transgenic mice;  (3) To identify protein  mediating the
              Nur77 responsiveness to calcium ionophore and  glucocorticoid suppressive
              effect (protein X) and (4) To assess the  function of the protein X identified
              above in apoptosis and in T  Cell development.  The findings should
              significantly enhance our  understanding of the apoptosis process at the
              molecular level.  ***  Programmed cell death is a critical part of the
              development of  multicellular organisms.  An unde rstanding of the genetic 
              regulation of this phenomenon will allow more insight into the  developmental
              process as well as, in a more practical sense, the  disease process which
              results when cells do not die as they should.  This work, to characterize a
              promoter element involved in such  regulation and to assess the function of
              involved genes should  contribute to that insight.  %%%
