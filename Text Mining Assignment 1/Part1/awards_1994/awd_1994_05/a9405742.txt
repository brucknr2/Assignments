Abstract    :
              9405742  Rye       This award provides partial funding for the support of  a
              technician assigned to the stable isotope laboratory in  the Department of
              Geology and Geophysics at Yale University.  The laboratory operates three
              stable isotope mass  spectrometers and has a heavy analytical work load of 
              measurements from research projects dealing with fundamental  problems in
              atmospheric, oceanic, mineral resources, and  environmental science.  ***
