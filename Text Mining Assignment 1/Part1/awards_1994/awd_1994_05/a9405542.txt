Abstract    :
              9405542  Sheehan    This research is to make seismic estimates of the sharpness
              and  depth distribution of mantle discontinuities which are important  for
              constraining models of composition and temperature in the  Earth.  Most
              measurements of this type have been made at sparsely  distributed global
              stations with significant lateral averaging.   However, the combined broadband
              array available from an upcoming  PASSCAL broadband deployment in the Colorado
              Plateau and Basin and  Range, integrated with existing broadband data from the
              western  U.S., provides a unique opportunity for high resolution imaging of 
              mantle discontinuity structure spanning the Basin and Range,  Colorado Plateau,
              Rocky Mountains, and Great Plains physiographic  provinces.  Knowledge of the
              details and variations in mantle  discontinuity structure across this large
              region is crucial in  determining the thermal and chemical structure of the
              upper mantle  and helping to answer fundamental questions regarding continental
               evolution and the nature of transitions between the physiographic  provinces
              sampled.  ***
