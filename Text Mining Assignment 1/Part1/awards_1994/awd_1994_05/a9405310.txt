Abstract    :
              9405310  Dyar  This research seeks to examine the interrelationships among 
              Fe3+, H+, and bulk composition of coexisting mantle minerals  from within a
              carefully-constrained geologic context.  Samples will be selected from Rio
              Grande rift and Colorado  Plateau localities which will be the sites of A
              U.S.G.S.  multidisciplinary transect planned for 1995.  We plan to 
              characterize Fe3+/   Fe ratios and H+ of all coexisting  minerals in mantle
              xenoliths collected from the chosen  localities, in order to determine regional
              variations in  mantle redox conditions along the transect.  We will also  study
              metasomatic redox processes in composite mantle  xenoliths with emphasis on
              observing redox differences and  similarities between cryptic and patent
              metasomatism.  H+  contents of all coexisting minerals in both unmetasomatized 
              and composite metasomatized xenoliths will be measured; when  possible, D/H
              ratios will also be determined in order to  better understand the role of H+ in
              mantle redox processes.
