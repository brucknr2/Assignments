Abstract    :
                This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will help the
              Department of  Chemistry at the SUNY--Stony Brook acquire a solid state 300 MHz
              NMR spectrometer which  will be used in research investigations in the
              following areas of chemistry, material science, and  earth space sciences:  (1)
               to study the absorption of basic probe molecules and  hydrofluorocarbons on
              surfaces, using double and triple resonance NMR, and to probe the 
              distributions of ions in disordered continuous solids such as fluorine fast-ion
              conductors and  oxy-fluorides; (2)  to investigate speciation in silicate
              glasses and liquids, in order to couple  structural information with the
              development of thermodynamic models for prediction of  phase equilibria of
              geologically important compositions at elevated pressures and  temperatures;
              (3)  to investigate models for metal-cysteine centers in metalloproteins; (4) 
              to study the molecular basis of amyloid fibril formation in type-II diabetes;
              and (5)  to use  NMR in close combination with diffraction data, to tackle
              problems of disorder in  mineralogy and zeolite chemistry.    Nuclear Magnetic
              Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to  chemists
              for the elucidation of the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify
              unknown  substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within
              molecules, and to study the  dynamics of interactions between molecules in
              solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR  spectrometry is essential to
              chemists who are carrying out frontier research.  The results from  these NMR
              studies are useful in the areas such as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.
