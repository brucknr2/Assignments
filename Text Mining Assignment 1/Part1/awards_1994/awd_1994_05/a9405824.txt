Abstract    :
              9405824  This proposal concerns computational approaches to determining the 
              behavior of membranes.  In particular, the goals of this project  include (1)
              further understanding of long-length-scale  conformations of membranes (2)
              determining the range of various  interactions between membranes separated by
              aqueous solvent (3)  developing new algorithms for the numerical simulation of
              the  dynamical behavior of polymers and membranes in solvent.  The  dynamical
              methodology involves treating the solvent via finite  difference methods
              coupled with a Langevin simulation of the  polymer/membrane.  %%%  This
              proposal is concerned with the shapes and dynamics of  membranes.  It uses new
              computational methodology to achieve this  end.  Membranes are, of course, very
              important in the natural  world.  In particular the PI will concentrate on the
              red blood  cells, vesicles and sponge-phases.  His interest is in transport of 
              such systems and in their shape both in static and dynamic (e.g. in  a flow)
              environment.  Further he will study how membranes interact  with one another
              when there is aqueous solution between them.  The  PI uses methods used in
              solid state physics and applies them to  bio-materials and bio-systems.  This
              is a fine example of cross-  disciplinary research.
