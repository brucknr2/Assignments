Abstract    :
              9405965  Anderson      The PIs will advance the capabilities of the resonance
              ultrasound  technique and exploit their present capabilities to investigate the
               high temperature elastic properties of iron and other iron-bearing  compounds.
               They will acquire new data on the high-temperature  derivatives of elasticity
              of bcc and fcc iron, measurements of  changes in the elastic properties of iron
              when going from the  ferromagnetic to paramagnetic phases, and changes in
              elasticity  when going from the bcc to the fcc structure.  These measurements 
              will provide new insight into the conditions in the Earth's core.   They will
              also continue and extend their work on FeO and Fe2SiO4.   ****
