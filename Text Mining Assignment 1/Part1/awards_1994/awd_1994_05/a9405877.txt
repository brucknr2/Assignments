Abstract    :
                9405877     Barron    PI will determine the ability of climate models to
              simulate  terrestrial floral biomes through Earth history and assess the role 
              of vegetation in paleoclimate predictions, and its contribution to  long-term
              climate change.  Overall objectives are: to clarify the  nature of
              discrepancies between climate models and observations, to  enable data-model
              comparisons, to make climate models more useful  in geologic applications, to
              guide use and interpretation of  climate model simulations for past and future
              simulations, and to  provide insights into differing roles of climate and
              evolution.
