Abstract    :
              9405507  Lindgren  An experimental program will be carried out at the Brookhaven
               National Laboratory's Laser Electron Gamma Source using high  energy polarized
              photons.  The emission of correlated pion and  nucleons, and nucleon pairs,
              will be used to explore the pion  production mechanism and short range
              nucleon-nucleon  correlations.  The polarization degree of freedom provides 
              enhanced sensitivity to exchange currents and other short-range  phenomena. 
              New tests of theory will be afforded.  ***
