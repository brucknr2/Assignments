Abstract    :
              9405573  Garcia  The purpose of this study is to determine the nature and 
              causes of compositional variation in lavas from the  continuing eruption (1983
              to present) of Kilauea Volcano,  Hawaii.  Mineral, glass and whole-rock
              compositions and O,  Pb, Sr, Nd and Th isotope ratios will be determined and
              used  to evaluate the relative importance of crystal  fractionation, magma
              mixing, lithosphere assimilation and  mantle melting processes in controlling
              the lava  composition.  Due to the long duration of this eruption (>  10
              years), the lavas from this eruption offer a unique  opportunity to investigate
              the effects of both crustal and  mantle processes on lava composition.  This is
              the only  study that has extensively characterized Kilauea lavas.  Only by
              fully characterizing Kilauea lavas can we hope to  decipher the origin and
              evolution of this critical key  component to the hotspot paradigm.
