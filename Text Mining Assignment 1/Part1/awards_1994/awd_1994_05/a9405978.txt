Abstract    :
              9405978  Gold  The lignin degradative system (LDS) of the white rot
              basidiomycetous fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium is capable of degrading the
              plant cell wall polymer, lignin, and a range of aromatic pollutants.  The major
              components of this nonspecific oxidative system are two extracellular
              heme-containing peroxidases, manganese peroxidase (MnP) and lignin peroxidase
              (LiP).  The LDS is expressed during secondary metabolic growth, the onset of
              which is triggered by limiting nutrient nitrogen.  MnP expression also is
              regulated at the level of gene transcription by Mn ion and by heat shock and
              chemical stress.  The primary goal of the project is to elucidate on the
              molecular level these specific mechanisms of mnp gene transcription.  Mn, heat
              shock and H2O2 regulation of individual mnp genes will be analyzed under
              conditions of nitrogen and carbon limitation. Site-directed mutagenesis, 
              deletion analysis and synthetic promoter elements are being used to identify
              the cis-acting sequences required for Mn and heat shock regulation.  DNaseI
              footprinting and gel mobility shift assays will be used to assay putative
              DNA-binding transcription factors.  Mn and heat shock-induced mnp mRNAs will be
              compared and the possibility of a post-transcriptionial Mn requirement will be
              examined.  %%%  The lignin degradative system (LDS) of the fungus Phanerochaete
              chrysosporium is capable of degrading the plant cell wall polymer, lignin, and
              a range of aromatic pollutants.  The primary goal of this project is to
              determine what causes the genes for the enzymes involved in this degradation to
              be turned on and off.  This work may ultimately help in the removal of
              pollutants from the environment.
