Abstract    :
              9405018  This proposal concerns computer simulations of phase transitions.  In
              general the work focusses on lattice systems via Monte Carlo,  molecular
              dynamics and spin dynamics methods.  The models to be  investigated include
              transitions in magnetic materials, cubic  binary alloys, crystal growth,
              adsorbates and high Tc materials.  Static and dynamic critical phenomena will
              be of primary interest  particularly with reference to confined geometries
              (e.g.  capillarity).  %%%  This proposal considers phase transitions in
              condensed matter.  It  uses computer simulation to elucidate mechanisms and
              behavior as  these transitions are approached as a function of temperature or 
              concentration.  The systems to be studied are the high temperature 
              superconductors, two component alloys, magnetic materials and  adsorbing gases.
               Also the mechanisms of crystal growth will be  investigated.  How these
              behaviors change when the system is  confined (as in a capillary for example)
              is of particular interest.  Such work lies at the heart of our understanding of
              much materials  behavior.
