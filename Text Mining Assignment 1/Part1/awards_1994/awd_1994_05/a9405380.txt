Abstract    :
              9405380  Boley  This project will develop and experiment with a variety of core 
              numerical algorithms for large sparse or structured linear  algebra problems. 
              Part of the research is the development of  effective algorithms for the
              analysis and design of very large  control models such as those related to
              large flexible space  structures.  To accomplish this, a major focus of this
              research  will be the design of effective and efficient linear algebra 
              algorithms.  Examples of problems to be addressed are large  Lyapunov
              equations, large order matrix pencils, large eigenvalue  and singular values
              solvers.  Parallel algorithms will be  explored and exploited.  Approximate
              solutions obtained via  Krylov space methods, or other methods, will be
              analyzed.  A  standard sparse matrix library (SPARSKIT) will be used as the 
              foundation for the software development.  To evaluate the  effectiveness of the
              algorithms, the quality of controller  designs obtained from the approximate
              solutions will be  explored.  ***
