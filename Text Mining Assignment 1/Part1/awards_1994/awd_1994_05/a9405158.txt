Abstract    :
              9405158  Miner       The University of Oklahoma Department of Mathematics  hopes
              to purchase a graphic workstation from Silicon  Graphics, Inc., and a 486 PC to
              serve as a terminal.  The  equipment would be used to help visualize the
              geometry of  complex hyperbolic space and its boundary.  In particular,  we
              hope to use interactive three dimensional graphics to  develop intuition for a
              wide array of problems concerning  groups actions and fundamental domains, arc
              curvature, curve  evolution, and quasiconformal mapping in the often 
              surprising and relatively unexplored geometry of complex  hyperbolic space.
