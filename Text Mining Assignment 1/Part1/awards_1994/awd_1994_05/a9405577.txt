Abstract    :
              9405577  Hole                             This research is to support
              continuation of the development of 3-  D forward and inverse analysis
              procedures for seismic data.  An  existing software program will be extended
              and improved to allow  the computation of reflection travel times in detailed
              3-D media.   Algorithms will be developed to invert both refraction and 
              reflection travel times to determine both velocity and reflecting  interface
              structures.  The use of amplitudes in the analysis will  lead to the inversion
              for 3-D attenuation structure (Q).  The  emphasis will be on the development of
              practical analysis tools  that can be widely applied by all scientists to 3-D
              seismic  surveys.  ***
