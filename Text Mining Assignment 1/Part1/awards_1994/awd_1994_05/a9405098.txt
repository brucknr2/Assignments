Abstract    :
              9405098  Colvard       Charge division detectors form am important class of 
              detectors for quantitative imaging of low-intensity  electron, ion, or photon
              beams.  A common example is the  resistive anode encoder (RAE), commonly used
              to create  composition images in secondary-ion mass spectrometry  (SIMS).  A
              significant drawback of present RAD-type  detectors is their limited maximun
              counting rate.  This  research project proposes  to significantly increase the 
              speed of these detectors by using a new electronic pulse  processing approach
              and a novel interconnection scheme to  reduce their pulse-counting dead time by
              a factor of  ten.  A Phase I study showed that it is possible to integrate the 
              pulses and perform the necessary processing on pulses  separated by as little
              as 30 ns.  this Phase II research  will study the incorporation of the fast
              pulse processing  design into a functioning RAE detector, including the 
              analysis of pulse propagation and ringing across voltage  isolating
              connections.  By pulling everything together, the  product of this research
              will be a functioning prototype  ultrafast position sensitive detector that can
              then be  refined and commercialized in Phase III.  ***
