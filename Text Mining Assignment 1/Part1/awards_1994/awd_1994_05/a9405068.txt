Abstract    :
              9405068  Caviness     The research to be carried out is in the general area of
              algorithms for integration in finite terms (that is, indefinite or symbolic
              integration) with particular emphasis on the development and implementation of
              algorithms involving special functions.  In the last few decades substantial
              progress has been made on algorithms for integration in finite terms.  Risch's
              work culminated more than a century of work on integration of elementary
              functions.  Almost immediately attention turned to integration involving larger
              classes of functions including special functions.  The first real advance in
              this area was the extension of the Liouville theorem for a class of special
              functions by Singer, Saunders, and Caviness upon which Cherry and Knowles
              developed algorithms for integrating integrands containing error functions and
              logarithmic integrals in terms of such.  This work however did not cover the
              important dilogarithms and associated functions that occur in many
              applications.  Baddoura's work has given an elegant way to integrate in terms
              of the dilogarithm.     This project will continue this line of research.  The
              overall objective is to implement the algorithms obtained and to improve and
              extend their scope for integration of and in terms of various special
              functions.  ***
