Abstract    :
              9405185  Brooks    In the past, Russian natural resources have been developed in
              some  areas of the country without giving due consideration to  significant
              environmental effects.  As companies of the United  States now seek to invest
              in some of these areas of Russia,  environmental issues need to be addressed
              before development  occurs.  An Industry/University Cooperative Research Center
              for  Russian Environmental and Natural Resources can utilize Russian 
              researchers to study the environmental problems that need to be  addressed for
              development to occur.    This award provides funding for Texas A&M University
              to hold a  planning meeting with potential industry members to determine if 
              there is enough potential support from American companies to  support an
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for  Russian Environmental and
              Natural Resources.    The Principal Investigator and his colleagues are
              recognized  experts in their fields and well qualified to perform this study.  
               The Program Manager recommends Texas A&M University be awarded  $10,000 for
              one year.
