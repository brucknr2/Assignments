Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT -- CTS-9405237  Howell     The proposed research requests funds to
              investigate the heat transfer characteristics of fluids at or near the critical
              point.  Four tasks have been proposed:  first to gather available data on heat
              transfer to supercritical water and other fluids and evaluate these data;
              second, to investigate predictive techniques for heat exchange at supercritical
              conditions; third, to apply a newly developed technique to one fluid other than
              supercritical water; and fourth, to report the results and analyze the
              applicability of the results for application to other fluids.  The proposal was
              submitted as a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) as a result of
              conversations between the PI and the Thermal Transport and Thermal Processing
              Program Director.  The qualifications of the PI and his ability to perform
              fundamental work in this area are excellent.  The relevance of the proposal,
              the fact that the subject area is one of increasing importance, and the
              uncertainty of the outcome make this particular proposal an excellent candidate
              for the SGER program.
