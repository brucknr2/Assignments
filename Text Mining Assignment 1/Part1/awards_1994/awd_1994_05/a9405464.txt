Abstract    :
              9405464  Holmes  This conference builds on a previous mineral bioprocessing 
              conference, but differs from other minerals bioprocessing  conferences by
              developing a dialogue between biotechnologists and  practitioners.  Industry
              practitioners will describe the  challenges and opportunities for biotechnical
              applications in the  minerals and fossil fuel fields.  Biotechnology experts
              will be  brought in from the minerals, pharmaceutical, agricultural, and  waste
              remediation areas to share their experiences and discuss  how recent advances
              in these diverse areas could be applied to  the minerals industry.    The
              program will be a combination of plenary sessions, large  working group
              meetings, site visits, and a variety of ad-hoc  sessions.  It is anticipated
              that the conference proceedings will  be published in a professional journal.
