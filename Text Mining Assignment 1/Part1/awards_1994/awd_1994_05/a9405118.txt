Abstract    :
              9405118 Keef             This award supports research on p-local abelian groups,
              that is  modules over the integers localized at the prime p. The principal 
              investigator will apply some of the new approaches of abelian  group theory to
              the theory of p-alpha-purity.  Of particular  importance are tools stemming
              from the increasing interplay  between set-theory and abelian groups, recent
              work on the  structure of the torsion product, important structure theorems 
              relating to the class of IT groups, the theory of valuated groups  and vector
              spaces, and the higher derived functors of the inverse  limit.             
              This project is in the general area of abelian group theory and  is concerned
              with the classification of abelian groups.  Although  the classification of
              finite abelian groups has been well  understood for a century, the
              classification of infinite abelian  groups remains elusive.  This research
              involves this old problem  of classification of the infinite abelian groups
              approached by  new tools from logic and topology.
