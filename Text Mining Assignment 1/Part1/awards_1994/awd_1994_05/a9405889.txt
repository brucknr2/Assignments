Abstract    :
              9405889  Ague  The proposed research will continue to address the  hypothesis
              that major metasomatism may control the  mineralogic evolution of pelites.  If
              pelite chemistry may  be commonly altered as a result of syn-metamorphic fluid 
              flow processes, then metamorphism plays a much larger role  in determining the
              physicochemical evolution of the middle  and lower crust than previously
              thought.  The hypothesis  will be tested by carrying out an integrative
              petrologic and  stable isotope study in Barrovian type area of the Scottish 
              Highlands.  The aims of the proposed research are to (1)  determine the nature
              and effects of mass transfer through  regional mapping of vein sets and
              petrologic mass balance  analysis, (2) constrain the timing of mass transfer
              relative  to metamorphic and deformational events using petrographic 
              observations and backscattered electron imaging, and (3)  determine the fluxes
              of metasomatic fluids, time scales of  fluid flow, and fluid flow paths using
              both petrologic and  stable isotope methods.
