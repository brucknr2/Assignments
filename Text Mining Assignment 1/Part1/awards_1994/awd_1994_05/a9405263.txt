Abstract    :
              9405263  Kelsey  Through stratigraphic study of Holocene deposits in selected 
              estuaries and low-lying coastal lakes in southern coastal Oregon,  PI and
              collaborators will assess whether or not subduction zone  earthquakes and
              associated tsunamis have affected the region.   Evidence for seismic shaking
              (liquefaction) and tsunamis and  tsunami magnitude will be evaluated.  Through
              this study a  paleoseismic history for the last c. 4000 years will be
              developed.
