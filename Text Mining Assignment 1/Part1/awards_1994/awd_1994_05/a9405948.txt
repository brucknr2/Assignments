Abstract    :
                9405948  Masters    This research is to continue an investigation of
              long-period body wave data in order to resolve  aspherical elastic and
              anelastic structure in the mantle.  The main areas of focus will be 1) the 
              measurement and interpretation of global datasets of body-wave attenuation -
              special emphasis  will be on constraint of lateral variations in Q structure
              which will complement other studies that  use surface waves.  An attempt will
              also be made to constrain the form of the absorption band  in the earth; 2) the
              use of body-waveform modeling to handle triplication regions of the 
              seismograms - the method employs a 3-D ray tracer which is also useful for
              looking at non-  linear behavior of travel-time perturbations and 3) modelling
              of entire global datasets including  various geodynamical prejudices.    ***
