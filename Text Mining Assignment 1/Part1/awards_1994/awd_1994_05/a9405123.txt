Abstract    :
              9405123  Lanier       The involvement of undergraduate students in faculty
              research  can play a critical role in enhancing the preparedness of these 
              students to pursue advanced degrees in the sciences as well as  preparation for
              careers in science education.  This proposal  requests funding to support
              undergraduate research concerning the  sedimentology of the fluvial to
              mid-estuarine transitions of  Pennsylvanian incised valley-fill deposits from
              the Douglas Group  (Missourian-Virgilian) of eastern Kansas.  The research
              project  involves the acquisition of drill cores to study the  sedimentological
              details of these paleoestuarine facies  transitions.  Given the fine-grained,
              silty-through-muddy  lithologies which characterize these facies, they form few
              good  surface exposures.  However, the existing outcrops have been  analyzed in
              great detail in terms of their sedimentology,  stratigraphy, and paleontology,
              which will allow for a similarly  detailed projection of this information into
              the subsurface.   Although regional in its focus, these studies have broad 
              implications with regard to the sedimentology and sequence  stratigraphy of
              incised valley-fill successions.  The research is  ideally suited for
              undergraduates insofar as it well-defined in its  goals, scientifically
              significant in its application, and confined  in its scope.
