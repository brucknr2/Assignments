Abstract    :
              9405767  Satake     This research is to quantitatively model non-seismic
              tsunamis.   Tsunamis are caused by various geological phenomena and recorded as
               waveforms on tide gauges, documented as run-up heights or  geologically
              recorded as tsunami deposits.  Tsunamis from  earthquake fault motion have been
              well studied and the earthquake  source parameters can be estimated from
              tsunami records.   Generation mechanism of non-seismic tsunamis, on the other
              hand, is  still poorly known and various speculations have been make for the 
              source of the observed tsunamis, without making quantitative  examinations. 
              These include unusually large tsunamis from  "tsunami" earthquakes, volcanic
              tsunamis and possibly submarine  landslides, as revealed by recent submarine
              imaging.  This research  will help us better understand the submarine
              geological processes  that generate tsunamis, and also will provide us basic
              information  to prepare for future tsunamis.  This research is a component of 
              the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.  ***
