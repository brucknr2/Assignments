Abstract    :
              9405347  Swisher       This project is intended to greatly improve the temporal 
              calibration of the geomagnetic polarity time scale (GPTS) in the O-  25 Ma age
              range (Miocene-Pleistocene).  Currently, calibration of  the GPTS in this time
              interval is based on three radioisotopic tie-  points; 2.8 Ma, 14.8 Ma and 23.8
              Ma.  We propose to obtain between  twenty and thirty high-precision 40Ar/39Ar
              dates for specific  reversals in this time interval from a variety of lmcations
              and  geologic settings, including the Mediterranean, East Africa,  Iceland, and
              North America.  This project is partly an outgrowth  and synthesis of several
              ongoing research efforts by the PI's whose  integration will increase the
              efficiency and timeliness of  obtaining accurate radioisotopic tie-points will
              produce, for the  first time, a GPTS based on the highest quality 40Ar/39Ar
              ages  obtainable, one that is capable of rigorously testing orbitally-  tuned
              time scales beyond the Miocene/Pliocene boundary.  This  intercomparison will
              help evaluate the causes and timing of global  climate change, and will also be
              useful in assessing the ages of  40Ar/39Ar ages obtainable, one that is capable
              of rigorously testing  orbitally-tuned time scales beyond the Miocene/Pliocene
              boundary.   This intercomparison will help evaluate the causes and timing of 
              global climate change, and will also be useful in assessing the  ages of
              40Ar/39Ar dating standards for application well beyond the  time range covered
              by this project.
