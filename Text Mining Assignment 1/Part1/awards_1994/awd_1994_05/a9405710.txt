Abstract    :
              9405710  Ruiz       This award provides partial funding for the support of  a
              technician assigned to the William M. Keck Isotope  Laboratory in the
              Department of Geosciences at the  University of Arizona. The laboratory
              operates a negative  ionization thermal mass spectrometer (NTIMS) and an 
              inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometer with a laser  ablation source
              (LA-ICP-MS), and has a heavy analytical work  load of measurements from
              NSF-funded research projects  dealing with fundamental problems in the origin
              of mineral  deposits, crustal and mantle petrogenesis, tectonic  evolution of
              North America, origin of volcanic provinces and  sedimentary basins, and the
              geological dating of diamonds.  ***
