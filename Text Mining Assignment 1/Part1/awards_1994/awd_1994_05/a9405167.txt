Abstract    :
              9405167  Nowack     This research is a collaboration between the University of 
              Illinois and Purdue University to analyze short-period and broad-  band seismic
              waveform data from the northwestern Pacific.  Because  of the complex tectonic
              setting and major subduction zones in the  area, pronounced variation in
              lithospheric and upper mantle  structure is expected near this margin.  Using
              high-resolution  seismic waveform data, a detailed study of such variation can
              place  additional constraints on mantle dynamics and mineral physics.   Using
              high-quality seismic data from the broad-band networks, the  proposed work
              complements existing long-period and travel time  studies in this region.
