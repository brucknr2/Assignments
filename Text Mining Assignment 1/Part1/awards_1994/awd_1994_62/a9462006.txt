Abstract    :
              In this proposal, we describe the development of a new epitaxial growth
              technique, suitable for the deposition of a wide variety of thin films of
              organic materials. The new method, Organic Vapor Phase Deposition, (OVPD), is
              based on the principles of the Organo-Metalic Vapor Phase Epitaxy, (OMVPE),
              which is currently the most widely used method for the growth of epitaxial
              films of inorganic electronic and photonic materials.   The method will be
              applied to growth of light emitting organic films such as PTCDA, NTCDA, TPD and
              Mq3. Organic LEDs will be made and their optoelectronic characteristics will be
              evaluated.   In Phase II full color displays as large as 6OOcm2 will be made.
              This completely new proposed growth technology builds on a substantial
              demonstrated expertise in the vacuum deposition of such organic materials,
              where the consultant to this SBIR (Prof. S. Forrest, Princeton University) is
              well-known pioneer in the field of organic thin film growth, and Dr. Vladimir
              S. Ban, (PI ), who is an expert in design of epitaxial reactors and epitaxial
              growth.
