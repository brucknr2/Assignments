Abstract    :
                   The investigator develops generalized fast Fourier transforms  (FFT's).  Of
              principal importance is the further development of  techniques for constructing
              FFT's for finite groups, as well as  the extension of algorithmic tools for the
              efficient and  numerically stable computation of Fourier transforms for 
              band-limited functions on nonabelian compact groups and their  quotients.  This
              interdisciplinary research draws from the areas  of computational group theory,
              representation theory, and  complexity theory, as well as those areas of
              science in which  applications are explored.       Historically, by speeding
              certain fundamental scientific  computations, the ``classical'' FFT has had a
              tremendous impact on  society.  It is one of the most important algorithmic
              tools in  digital signal processing and as such plays a key role in such  areas
              as medical imaging, defense, telecommunications, and high  performance
              computing.  The utility of the classical FFT is an  indicator that perhaps
              similar success may be obtained from  applying these newly developed
              generalized FFT's.  Applications  towards more efficient use of high
              performance computing networks  (the information superhighway) are under
              investigation.  The  investigator and his colleagues continue to apply
              generalized  FFT's in statistics and data analysis.  Specific applications in 
              climate modelling and structural chemistry have also been  identified and are
              being pursued.
