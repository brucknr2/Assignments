Abstract    :
              9404891  Van Schmus       This award provides one-half the funding necessary to 
              upgrade the counting system of a mass spectrometer purchased  in 1986. The
              thermal ionization mass spectrometer will  acquire new Faraday cups and a new
              ion counting system. The  upgraded equipment will continue to be operated for
              research  and teaching purposes in geochemistry in the Department of  Geology
              at the University of Kansas. The University is  committed to providing the
              remaining funds needed to pay for  the upgrade.       Research applications
              include measurements of uranium-  lead, samarium-neodymium, and
              rubidium-strontium isotopic  systematics for dating and determining the origin
              of igneous  rocks associated with regional tectonic processes and  crustal
              evolution.  ***
