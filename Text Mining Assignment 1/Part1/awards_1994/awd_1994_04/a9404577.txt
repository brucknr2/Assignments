Abstract    :
              9404577  Sparling       The research covers topics relating the geometry of the 
              solution spaces of classes of partial differential equations and    that of an
              associated complex manifold. Integral geometric  techniques can be combined to
              study Radon-like transformations  which may have potential applications to
              CATSCAN and magnetic  resonance imaging. Problems relating to solitons and
              integrable  systems will also be pursued.  ***
