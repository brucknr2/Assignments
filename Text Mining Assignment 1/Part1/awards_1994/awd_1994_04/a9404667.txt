Abstract    :
              9410270  Wangemann  This conference provides a forum for discussion of all
              aspects of  nonlinear optics; including new phenomena, novel devices, and 
              advanced materials.  The meeting is cosponsored by the IEEE Lasers  and
              Electro-Optics Society and the Optical Society of America.  The  topics to be
              considered will include (but not limited to) the  following:  1) Fundamental
              Studies, 2) Nonlinear Optical Materials,  3) Wave Mixing and Phase Conjugation,
              4) Surface Nonlinear Optics,  5) Fibers and Waveguides, 6) Nonlinear Cavity
              Electrodynamics, 7)  Ultrafast Nonlinear Optics/Lasers, 8) Novel Nonlinear
              Optical  Phenomena and Applications, and 9) NLO Information Storage and 
              Processsing.  ***
