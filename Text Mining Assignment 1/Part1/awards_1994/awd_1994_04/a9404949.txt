Abstract    :
              9404949  Tarn     The objective of this project is the design and experimental
              study of a dual-robot assembly workcell based on the event-based planning and
              control method developed at Washington University.  The workcell will be able
              to perform various coordinated/cooperated assembly tasks and capable of
              automatic response to some unexpected events such as the occurrence of
              obstacles or the misplacement of parts.  Several problems related to
              fundamental computer and robotic engineering need to be solved to achieve the
              above stated goal.  The focus of the work will be on the following specific
              problems: (1) Integration of sensed event with the action planning and control
              of robotic manufacturing system, and (2) Develop a computing and control
              architecture and computational algorithm to experimentally implement the
              event-based action planning and control method for dual-robot assembly
              workcell.     The proposed research project is aimed (1) to elevate dual-robot
              assembly workcell to a new level of task performance capabilities and (2) to
              reduce the down-time of robotic workstations in various application
              environments.  ***
