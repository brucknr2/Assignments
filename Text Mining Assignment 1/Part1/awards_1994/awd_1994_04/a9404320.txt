Abstract    :
              9404320  Pinedo    This Americas Program award will fund Dr. Michael Pinedo, 
              Columbia University, in a joint collaboration with Dr.  Miguel Nussbaum,
              Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,  to  design and develop a modular,
              flexible,  general purpose  scheduling environment.  The  aim of  the project 
              is to  refine and extend a variety of known theoretical results and  algorithms
              for scheduling problems, and develop techniques  for combining the procedures
              into one framework suitable for  implementation.   The resulting framework will
              then be  incorporated into an interactive, object-oriented system.  The
              research is based on problem decomposition; i.e.,  dividing the scheduling
              problem into a number of sub-  problems and then aggregating the results
              obtained into a  comprehensive global solution of the original problem.     The
              project will be a significant contribution to  scheduling education, as well as
              industrial practice.  During the last decade many industries have attempted to 
              develop, design and implement scheduling systems for their  operations, but
              have not always been successful because the  systems  were not sufficiently
              flexible, and not able to  adapt easily to changing objectives and constraints.
               The  development of a tool to classify and successfully decompose  any
              scheduling problem will be of great benefit to users of  scheduling models.  
              The collaboration will profit from  the  complementary  strengths of both 
              scientists and  institutions.  Columbia University has an established record 
              in scheduling theory and applications, while Universidad  Catolica has
              extensive experience in the design and  development of scheduling systems.
