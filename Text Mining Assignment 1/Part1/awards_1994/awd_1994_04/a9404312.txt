Abstract    :
              9404312  Yang       The topics proposed in the research entail curvature 
              estimates on classes of four-dimensional manifolds. This also  includes a study
              of the geometry of actions of the integer modulo  p-group where for p equal to
              a prime number it is intended to  prove a homeomorphism classification theorem
              for nonnegative  sectional curvature. Deformations of exotic differentiable 
              structures on the 7-sphere will also be analyzed. The research  has potential
              applications to topology and gauge field theory in  mathematical physics.  ***
