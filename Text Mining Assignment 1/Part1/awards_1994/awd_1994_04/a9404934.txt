Abstract    :
              9404934  Tafti  This proposal plans to construct a scalable computational fluid
              dynamics computer program for use on massively parallel processing platforms. 
              The parallel algorithm will be designed in a structured modular manner with
              emphasis on easy portability to various MPP machines.  This will allow the
              computer program to be used to evaluate various MPP platforms in solving
              large-scale fluid flow computations.  The modular and general code structure
              will allow one to attack a wide variety of fluid dynamics problems as well as
              accommodate supplementary equations.  It will focus on understanding and
              predicting separated flows in the moderate to high Reynolds number range. 
              Accurate prediction techniques based on Pade or compact difference schemes will
              be developed and used to evaluate subgrid-scale turbulence models in a simple
              yet fundamental separated flow configuration.  The extraction of embedded two
              and three-dimensional structures represents a major part of proposed research.
