Abstract    :
              9404697  Tobisch       Very large granitic bodies are a common feature in the 
              development of magmatic arcs and convergent continental margins,  however
              despite considerable study the mechanisms of ascent,  assembly and emplacement
              of granitic magma  within mid-to-upper  crustal levels are still controversial.
               This project will test a  possible solution involving whether elongate,
              large-volume Early-  Late Cretaceous plutons typical of the Sierra Nevada,
              California,  represent dike-fed magma chambers rather than diapirs.  the work 
              will involve establishing the geometry and kinematics of magma flow  in the
              pluton and model the assembly and emplacement, while  constraining the ascent
              mechanism from the flow dynamic and  observed wall rock structures the main
              tools will be anisotropy of  magnetic susceptibility (AMS) image analysis of
              magmatic fabrics  and field observation.  Results are expected to provide
              sufficient  documentation to help resolve the magma room problem and help 
              develop a tectonic model of the Sierra Nevada that more accurately  treats the
              magmatic activity.
