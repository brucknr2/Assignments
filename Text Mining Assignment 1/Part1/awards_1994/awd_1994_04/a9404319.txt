Abstract    :
              A low-temperature and high-magnetic field facility is  requested for combination
              with existing optical and quasi-  optical measurement configurations to enable
              the exploration  of electrodynamics of various novel electron states of 
              solids. The facility is a He3 system combined with a 9T  magnetic field which
              is provided by a split ring magnet. A  conventional He3 system will be employed
              (together with  coaxial cable and wave guide access configuration) in the 
              radio to millimeter wave spectral range. In addition,  optical access (provided
              by specially designed optical  windows) will be provided for spectrometers
              operating at  submillimeter wave to infrared frequencies. The facility  will be
              used to measure the frequency dependent complex  conductivity under
              circumstances when the energy related to  the applied ac field hw , the thermal
              energy kT and the  energy associated with the magnetic field  BH can be varied 
              over substantial ranges. Experiments will be conducted on  interacting electron
              systems mainly in their broken symmetry  ground states.  %%%  This research has
              developed a variety of measurement  techniques which allow the exploration of
              electrodynamics of  solids in an extremely broad spectral range, from audio to 
              infrared frequencies. In this proposal, funds are requested  to acquire a
              low-temperature and high-magnetic field  facility in order to expand
              measurement in region and to a  host of phenomenon that cannot be studied
              previously for  metals. These facilities are used to study the properties of 
              various novel materials having
