Abstract    :
              9404762  Li      This research is to study the postseismic healing of the fault
              zone ruptured in the M=7.4 Landers earthquake of 1992 by monitoring propagation
              characteristics of fault zone trapped waves using portable high-capability
              seismometers.  Previous work showed evidence for seismic guided waves trapped
              within the fault zone of the Landers earthquake.  Based on trapped mode data,
              it resolved a low velocity, high-attenuation layer with a width of 180 m along
              the rupture plane.  This layer extends from the surface to a depth of at least
              10 km in the seismogenic zone.  It was also found that the width of this layer
              varies vertically and laterally along the fault zone, and it becomes very
              narrow at the fault bend.  Observations and simulation of fault zone trapped
              waves show that the amplitudes and frequency contents of these waves are very
              sensitive to the velocity structure and properties of the fault zone. 
              Therefore, the subsurface fault variability in space and time can be detected
              through monitoring minor changes in amplitude and dispersion characteristics of
              fault zone trapped waves.  Results from this study should advance understanding
              of fault zone structure, rheology and constitutive relations, the transition
              from quasistatic nucleation to dynamic rupture, and the models and mechanisms
              for earthquake recurrence.  This research is a component of the National
              Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.  ***  ??
