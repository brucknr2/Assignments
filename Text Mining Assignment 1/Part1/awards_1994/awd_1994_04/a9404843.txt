Abstract    :
              9404843  Butler       An important problem in the tectonics of the Pacific
              Northwest  concern the displacement and accretionary history of the Alexander- 
              Wrangellia terrane of southeast Alaska and Coastal British  Columbia.  There is
              presently no consensus on the positions of the  terrane during Jurassic through
              Paleocene time and tectonic  processes by which the terrane was accreted to
              North America are  controversial.  This project, a collaborative effort between
               working at the University of Arizona and the University of  Mississippi., will
              test various tectonic models of the area by  paleomagnetic and detrital zircon
              age dating methods.  Results  should help place new constraints on the
              displacement and  accretionary history of the Alexander-Wrangellia terrane.
