Abstract    :
              9301989  Kelly  This  project provides  additional,  supplemental funding to
              enable  the  completion  of  the  renovation  of  University of California
              earthquake  simulator  facility  this  facility  has  been  the  major 
              experimental  resource of the U.S. over the  last  two  decades and the
              renovation  in  progress    will    upgrade     the  capability  to a much
              higher  level  than before as required for testing  of complex, large scaled
              structural  model  to  the nonlinear, inelastic  range.    The supplemental
              funds are required  to  acquire new hydraulic equipment  and to carry out new
              designs of the  hydraulic   system  which   is   an  essential part of the
              shaking table  in the simulator facility.  ***
