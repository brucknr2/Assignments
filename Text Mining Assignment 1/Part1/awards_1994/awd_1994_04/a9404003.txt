Abstract    :
                9404003  van Zee  This is an individual Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
              Plant Biology award.  The applicant received her Ph.D. from University of
              Munich in Germany.  For her Ph.D. thesis research, she focused on the cellular
              machinery required for nuclear protein importing mammalian cells.  She now
              plans to expand her scientific experience to plant biology.  She will carry out
              her postdoctoral fellowship research in the laboratory of Dr. Tony Chen at
              Oregon State University.  The proposed research is entitled "A strategy for
              selecting novel Arabidopsis thaliana mutants in abscisic acid signal
              transduction pathways".
