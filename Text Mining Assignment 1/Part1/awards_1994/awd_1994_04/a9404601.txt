Abstract    :
              9404601  Gromoll        The research involves studies into the structure and 
              parametrization of submanifolds of certain classes of  differentiable
              manifolds. Rigidity problems will be undertaken in  view of curvature
              properties. The geometry of metric fibrations  will also be considered. This
              research has potential important  applications to other branches of
              differential geometry and  mathematical physics. Submanifold geometry has found
              recent  applications to soliton theory.  ***
