Abstract    :
              9404657  Kapouleas          The research covers topics related to the
              construction of  Einstein metrics using perturbation techniques. Included is
              the  geometric study of classes of Ricci-flat complete manifolds of 4- 
              dimensions. Solutions to the hyperbolic Einstein's equation will  also be
              investigated. The research has potential applications to  general relativity
              theory in theoretical physics.  ***
