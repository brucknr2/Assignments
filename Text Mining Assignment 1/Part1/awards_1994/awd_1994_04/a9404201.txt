Abstract    :
              9404201  Barrett       The projects cover problems in the general area of
              several  complex variables concerning estimates for the Cauchy-Riemann 
              equations on Riemann surfaces, Poincare series and holomorphic  foliations on
              complex projective spaces. Some problems related to  random walks and queueing
              theory will also be pursued. The  research has potential applications to other
              areas of mathematics  such as algebraic geometry and stochastic analysis.  ***
