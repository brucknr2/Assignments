Abstract    :
              9404061  Katok       The topics covered in the proposed plan of research cover 
              geometric rigidity in classes of dynamical systems. These include 
              classifications of Anosov actions of certain groups and various  kinds of
              smooth actions of lattices on semi-simple Lie groups.  Areas of smooth ergodic
              theory relative to dynamical systems are  also planned for investigation. The
              research has potential  applications to other areas of dynamical systems theory
              and  mathematical physics.  ***
