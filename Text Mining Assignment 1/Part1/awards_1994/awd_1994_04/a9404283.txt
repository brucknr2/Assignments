Abstract    :
              9404283  Symes       This project will focus on inverse problems arising in 
              geophysics, in particular, the determination or estimation of the  index of
              refraction, or wave velocity, of a medium from  measurements made at or near
              the surface of the body. The field  equations for such problems are hyperbolic,
              or are closely  related to hyperbolic systems. Several key mathematical
              questions  will be investigated, each with substantial practical  implications:
              1) global estimates for a linearized inverse  problem for the wave equation in
              the presence of caustics; 2) the  relation between nonsmooth propagation of
              singularities and  linearization; 3) design of objective functions to give 
              quasiconvex optimization formulations of inverse problems; and 4) 
              accommodation of attenuation and dispersion; for example, inverse  problems in
              viscoelasticity.       The remote sensing techniques of pure and applied
              geophysics  use measurements of an acoustic or electromagnetic field near the 
              earth's surface to infer the internal structure of the earth.  These fields are
              modeled by the solutions of some appropriate  field equations in a domain
              representing a portion of the earth.  The coefficients of these equations
              represent distributed  physical parameters such as conductivity, stiffness,
              density,  etc. Thus remote sensing techniques pose inverse problems: to 
              estimate coefficients of field equations in the interior of a  domain from
              measurements of fields near the boundary. This  research concerns models of
              those experimental designs and  parameter ranges which cause the probe fields
              to consist of  propagating waves.
