Abstract    :
                   The principal investigators and their collaborators study the  development,
              analysis, and applications of numerical methods for  nonlinear partial
              differential equations.  The three main topics  addressed are: (1)  high
              resolution methods, including shock  capturing, front capturing, numerical
              homogenization, and particle  methods, (2) multiscale analysis applied to these
              and other  related problems, and (3) fast methods for linear evolution 
              equations based on multiscale analysis and high frequency  asymptotics. 
              Engineering and physical applications studied  include combustion, fluid
              dynamics, crystal growth, Stefan  problems, microwave scattering, and reacting
              gases.       These innovative numerical methods are used to simulate real 
              world problems in the areas of aeronautics, oil recovery,  materials science,
              and environmental science.  Transition to  industrial and military application
              is made in the above areas, as  well as in low observables, semiconductor
              device modelling, and  shape recognition.  These methods are applicable
              wherever the  phenomena to be studied have sharp changes of state variables or 
              are beyond the resolving capabilities of standard methods.
