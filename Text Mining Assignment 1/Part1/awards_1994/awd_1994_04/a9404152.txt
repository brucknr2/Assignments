Abstract    :
              9404152  Hunter        The goal of the proposed work is to understand the
              behavior of nonlinear  hyperbolic waves in continuum mechanics and classical
              field theory. The main  approach is to use singular perturbation methods to
              derive reduced equations  which capture essential nonlinear phenomena in their
              simplest form. These  reduced equations are then studied using modern
              analytical and numerical  methods. Specific problems include the transition
              from regular to irregular  reflection in weak shock reflection, nonlinear waves
              in random media, and  nonlinear waves in classical field theories.        Many
              kinds of waves --- such as sound waves, elastic waves, and  magnetohydrodynamic
              waves --- are described by hyperbolic partial differential  equations. At large
              enough amplitudes, these waves are nonlinear. The effects  of nonlinearity are
              often dramatic and are qualitatively different from the  predictions of a
              linear theory. For example, nonlinearity leads to the  formation of shocks, or
              sometimes to other kinds of singularities, and to  various kinds of nonlinear
              instabilities. This proposal concerns a wide  variety of physical problems
              involving nonlinear hyperbolic waves. The  problems include the reflection of
              shock waves, the propagation of large  amplitude sound waves through turbulent
              fluids, and the analysis of  orientation waves in a massive liquid crystal
              director field.
