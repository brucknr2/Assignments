Abstract    :
              9404174  Miner       The scope of the research entails problems related to the 
              geometry and topology of complex hyperbolic spaces and group  actions on these.
              Curvature invariants can be used to distinguish  between certain equivalences
              classes of manifolds modeled on the  boundary of the latter. Further questions
              concerning the geometry  of Heisenberg space will be pursued. This research may
              have  potential applications to mathematical physics.  ***
