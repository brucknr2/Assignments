Abstract    :
              Sethna  9404936  The research involves the development of new parallel
              algorithms to investigate the physics of disordered magnetic spin systems with
              very slow dynamics, and the implementation of those algorithms on the parallel
              machines at Cornell's Theory Center.  The combination of the elegant algorithm
              we have developed and the impressive power of Cornell's parallel computing
              resources promises to yield the first numerical answers to some long-standing
              questions.
