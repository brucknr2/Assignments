Abstract    :
              9404315  Cole        Aspects of essentially nonlinear stability in the laminar
              boundary layer  will be considered in the framework of the asymptotic triple
              deck theory.   Disturbances in the free stream such as vorticity or sound
              result in wave  packets which undergo explosive growth.  The nonlinear
              disturbances are  described by a forced Benjamin-Ono equation.  Chaotic
              pulsations are expected  to result on the way to transition.        The results
              here have their primary application to the prediction of  laminar-turbulent
              transition in boundary layer flows, such as those on  aircraft or in jet
              engines.  The understanding and control of turbulence will  make more efficient
              designs possible.  Similar disturbances have been observed  in the atmosphere
              where large nonlinear wave systems appear.  The theoretical  work here can lead
              to a better understanding of the interaction of topography  and storms.
