Abstract    :
              9404043  Singh    Description:  This project supports travel and  field expenses
              for Dr. Donald Zobel of Oregon  State University, Corvallis, OR and Dr. S. P. 
              Singh of Kumaun University, Nainital, India, to  collaborate in a project to
              study the moisture  stress in Himalayan tree species under various  conditions.
               The study has three goals: to  determine the degree to which forest types in 
              Kumaun, in the Indian central Himalaya are  differentiated by their degree and
              seasonal  pattern of moisture stress; to determine  mechanism of adaptation to
              drought by forest  trees in Kumaun forests, and; to improve  general
              understanding of the place of water  relations in physiological ecology of
              forest  trees, by providing data from forests in a  climate seldom studied, and
              through exchange of  information among scientists working in  different
              climates.  Measurements will be made  of the degree of morning moisture stress
              across  a range of forest types from 1000-2200 m  elevation, and of the
              components of water  potential and the degree of stomatal opening,  during leaf
              development before the wet season  begins, for mature leaves during the wet 
              season, and for mature leaves during the dry  season in fall and winter.   
              Scope:  This project complements research being  made in other parts in the
              world on different  climates, and provides information, not  available, for
              temperate areas with a wet-  summer, dry winter climate, and is necessary to 
              eliminate the regional bias in models of  adaptation to water availability. 
              The work  involves close collaboration, and division of  work by the U.S. and
              the Indian scientists.  It  meets the objectives of this collaboration.  ***
