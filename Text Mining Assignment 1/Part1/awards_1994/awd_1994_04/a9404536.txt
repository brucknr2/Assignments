              of  Significance in Applications.  Robert E. O'Malley, Jr., Principal 
              Investigator  University of Washington  Abstract: This research  project seeks
              asymptotic solutions to nonlinear singularly  perturbed boundary value problems
              which involve boundary, shock,  and other localized regions of rapid change.
              Such problems  involve substantial computational, as well as analytical, 
              challenges, and their effective solution requires hybrid  asymptotic/numeric
              approaches using numerical algorithms based on  the structure of asymptotic
              solutions and corresponding  asymptotic techniques motivated by careful
              numerical experiments  on difficult models. In this way, we continue to broaden
              our  understanding of the fundamental practical concept of asymptotic 
              matching.   Such mathematical problems occur frequently in  important
              applications throughout science and engineering; in  particular, in metastable
              models for phase-separation and  coarsening in materials and in
              reaction-diffusion models which  provide patterns for evolving biological
              processes. The need to  use an asymptotically exponentially-long time scale in
              such  aontexts corresponds to the mathematical issue of doing  "asymptotics
              beyond all orders."
