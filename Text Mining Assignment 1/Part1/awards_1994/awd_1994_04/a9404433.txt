Abstract    :
                9404433  Sternberg   The proposed research is concerned with mathematical
              modeling of physical   processes that occur in radio frequency discharges. The
              intent is to study the transition   from the constant ion mobility regime at
              the center of the plasma to the space-charge   regime at the plasma boundary in
              the static bounded plasma problem. It is also intended to   construct a
              mathematical model for determining the small signal capacitance of the sheath  
              at intermediate frequencies.   A more precise analytical and numerical
              understanding of the the plasma and the   sheath is vital for future successful
              applications in plasma chemistry, laser engineering,   microelectronics, and
              nuclear physics. Using mathematical methods, the proposed project   will
              improve the formulation of the physical experiments, and provide new insight
              into the   physical problem.
