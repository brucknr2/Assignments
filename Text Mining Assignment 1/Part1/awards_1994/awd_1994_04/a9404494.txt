Abstract    :
              9404494  Jacobowitz       The research involves the geometry and analysis of
              sytems of  partial differential equations on classes of manifolds inheriting 
              partially complex structures. This is related to the  generalization of the
              Stein and Kaehler structures arising in the  complex case. The study of such
              differential systems has  applications to other areas of mathematics and
              general  relativity.  ***
