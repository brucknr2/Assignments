Abstract    :
              This research is on a timing verification and optimization  framework for
              designing an entire digital system (e.g. a  microprocessor). The research
              builds on a widely used model for  synchronous timing analysis and an efficient
              method for estimating  gate and wire delays.  The model is being extended to
              include  relevant functional information in order to enhance accuracy.  
              Components of the framework are: design decomposition to isolate  critical
              elements; a path delay calculator; algorithms for finding  synchronizer
              components; clock analysis algorithms; a symbolic  sequential timing
              verification component; a hybrid timing-logic  simulator; and design
              optimizers.
