Abstract    :
              James Salvador is funded by a Minority Research Initiation grant from the  
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to perform research in   the
              general area of graph theory applied to databases of chemical   structural
              information.  Salvador will use generalizations of the   matching polynomial as
              a method of sorting and/or comparing lists of   structural data in connection
              tables or line notations.  Compact   topological indices will be used as
              descriptors to distinguish chemical   structures by connectivity, constitution,
              stereochemistry, or complete   three dimensional structures.  These indices and
              Chemical Abstract   CAS-Registry Numbers will permit retrieval of chemical
              information on   chemical compounds, their isomers and isomorphs by simply
              drawing out a   query on a computer screen.    Retrieval of chemical
              information from large databases such as those   maintained by Chemical
              Abstracts is a difficult problem because chemical   structures are three
              dimensional entities.  A number of techniques are   being developed to encode
              three dimensional information in numerical   indices which can be used to
              access such databases.  Many of the   techniques proposed to date do not
              uniquely encode this information, and   they result in a many to one
              relationship between indices and structures.    Salvador's research shows
              promise as a method for providing unique   coding of three dimensional
              structural information.
