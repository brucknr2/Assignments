Abstract    :
              This project, in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry
              Program, involves  the study of several aspects of platinum group chemistry as
              related to catalysis of organic  reactions.  Specific areas to be pursued
              include 1) further examination of the use of  parahydrogen induced polarization
              (PHIP) as an NMR probe of reaction mechanisms in  hydrogenation reactions, 2)
              activation of organic molecules by reaction with cationic and odd  electron
              rhodium and iridium species, and 3) reactions of rhodium and iridium complexes
              in  water and as part of dendrimeric structures; the former has implications
              for environmentally  friendly technologies whereas the latter may provide a
              means of substrate discrimination and  therefore selectivity.  For the aqueous
              solution work, the ligands to be used will impart water  solubility to the
              metal complexes.    The majority of industrial manufacturing processes use some
              type of catalyst, which serves to  increase reactions rates and, therefore,
              increase throughput with lower energy costs, and  frequently to alter product
              selectivity.  New catalysts and improved catalytic processes require  both
              exploratory studies of possible new catalysts and the better mechanistic
              understanding of  existing catalysts.  In addition, more environmentally
              acceptable processes may result if existing  catalytic systems that operate in
              organic solvents can be converted to aqueous solution processes.   This project
              has objectives in all three of these areas.
