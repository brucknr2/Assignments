Abstract    :
              9404824  Fasano  Francis Marion University requests support from NSF for
              connection  of its campus network to SURAnet.  SURAnet is the midlevel network 
              located in the southeastern area of the country and comprises 13  states.  It
              will provide operations management and information  services and it will give
              Francis Marion University a 56 thousand  bits per second connection to the
              NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45  million bits per second) National Backbone
              network.    The College needs greater functionality and network speed to be 
              able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers  along with
              being able to implement a more reliable mail system.   Students and faculty
              research will benefit from the link.  This is  also a unique opportunity for
              the school to explore innovative  educational resources.
