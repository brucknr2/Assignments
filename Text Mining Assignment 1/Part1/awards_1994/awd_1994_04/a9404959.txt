Abstract    :
              9404959  Salesin     Global illumination, which simulates the interreflection of
              light  between surfaces, is one of the most fundamental problems in computer 
              graphics, with a wide variety of applications.  During the award  period, the
              research will be focused on three critical aspects of the global  illumination
              problem:    (1) Controlled-precision methods -- Global illumination algorithms
              that compute tight bounds on the error simultaneously with the simulation will
              be developed.  These algorithms will be able to direct their computational
              efforts into regions where the error is largest, resulting in improvements in
              both speed and accuracy.    (2) Improving discontinuity meshing -- Incremental
              discontinuity-meshing algorithms in which only numerically or visually
              significant discontinuities are ever computed will be investigated. 
              Discontinuity meshing techniques are planned to be extended to curved surfaces.
                 (3) Smooth wavelet bases for radiosity -- The discontinuity meshing will be
              combined with the use of smooth wavelet bases in order to provide accurate, yet
              sparse, representations of the light transport between the surfaces of an
              environment.  ***
