Abstract    :
              Adams  9404992  The study of enzymes isolated from organisms inhabiting 
              unconventional ecosystems has led to the realization that  biocatalysis need
              not be constrained to mild conditions and can be  considered at pH's,
              temperatures, pressures, ionic and solvent  environments long though to be
              destructive to biological systems.   However, the intrinsic basis for
              biological function under such  extreme conditions is only starting to be
              addressed, as are  applications for what can be called extremozymes.  In
              addition to  expanding the search for novel and interesting enzymes from
              extreme  environments, it is important to bring to bear the current 
              sophistication in the study of protein structure and function.   Also, those
              familiar with potential uses of biocatalysis must  become more aware of the
              opportunities and challenges associated  with the identification study of
              extremozymes.  Ultimately, given  the information acquired from the study of
              extremozymes,  modification to less stable enzymes to improve their ranges of 
              stability and activity remains a possibility.  %%%  This workshop will bring
              together representatives from academia,  government and industry to provide a
              perspective on extremozymes  and their place in modern biocatalysis. 
              Contributions will cover  both fundamental and applied aspects in an effort to
              describe  exciting developments in progress as well as to identify potential 
              opportunities for the use of biological catalysts under extreme  conditions.
