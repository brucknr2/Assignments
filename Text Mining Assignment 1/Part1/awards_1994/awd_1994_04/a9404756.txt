Abstract    :
                To investigate computational discourse and psycholinguistic aspects  of the
              centering theory developed by the Principal Investigator,  and her students and
              colleagues.   The centering model addresses  the relation between the form of
              linguistic expression and the  local discourse coherence.  There are four
              issues investigated in  this research  effort.  The first deals with  the
              integration of  the centering theory with other linguistic processes in the 
              interpretation of pronouns.  The second involves the use  application of
              centering to additional context-dependent linguistic  forms such as ellipsis
              and accentuation.  The third consists of the  interaction between centering and
              discourse segmentation.  Finally,  the fourth aspect considers the formulation
              of computationally  tractable rules constraining centering transitions.
