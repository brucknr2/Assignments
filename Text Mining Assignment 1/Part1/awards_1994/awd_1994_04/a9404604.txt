Abstract    :
              9404604  Rivera         The investigator extends a variety of theoretical
              results  for dynamical systems and applies them to problems in electrical 
              engineering and mathematical biology.  The theoretical results  include:
              shooting methods, spectral analysis of operators on  Banach spaces to obtain
              new results on invariant manifolds, and  linearizations about stationary
              solutions.  These results are  applied to analyse the existence and stability
              of travelling  waves in PDE epidemic models and the losses in NFDE models of 
              electrical power transmission lines.         Biologists have observed that
              animal and human epidemics  spread throughout a geographical area in the form
              of a travelling  wave.  Engineers have observed how much loss occurs as 
              electricityis transmitted through power lines over distances.   The
              mathematical models mentioned above give reasonable  approximations to
              essential features of these physical phenomena  and enable us to improve our
              ability to predict and control them.   This is important because of the
              expanding problem of animal and  human epidemics (e.g.  HIV-AIDS and rabies). 
              The investigator  applies analytical and computational methods to improve 
              understanding of these models and to interpret the physical  meaning of the
              results.
