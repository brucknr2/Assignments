Abstract    :
              9404108  Lee       The Pacific Northwest Geometry Seminar arranges and conducts 
              a series of seminars and workshops at several institutions in the  NW region of
              the United States as an important infrastructural  activity. The topics covered
              include diverse areas of  differential geometry, dynamical systems,
              mathematical physics  and applications. The seminars are given by leading
              experts in  these fields and are aimed mainly at faculty members, post- 
              doctoral researchers and graduate students.  ***
