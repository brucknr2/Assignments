Abstract    :
              9404111  Mulase       The research covers topics in the geometric theory of 
              infinite dimensional integrable systems with particular focus on  the KP
              heirachy. Techniques involve relating certain differential  operators defined
              on Abelian varities. Matrix integral methods  and the geometry of the tau
              function will also be studied. The  research has potential applications to
              algebraic geometry and  mathematical physics, particularly to aspects of
              soliton theory.  ***
