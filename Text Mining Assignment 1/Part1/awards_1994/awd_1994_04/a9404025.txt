Abstract    :
                9404025  Fowler  This is an individual award for the Postdoctoral Research
              Fellowship in Plant Biology.  The applicant received his Ph.D. from University
              of California at Berkeley.  His Ph.D. research was in developmental genetics in
              maize.  He now plans to change his field of research and carry out his
              postdoctoral fellowship research in the laboratory of Dr. Ralph Quatrano at
              University of North Carolina.  The proposed research entitled "Mechanism of
              establishment of cellular polarity in the brown alga, Fucus" will expand the
              scientific experience of this Fellow into basic cell biology.
