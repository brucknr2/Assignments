Abstract    :
              9404058  Thomas    Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE) is important to industry
              since it  is a means to assure safety, product quality and a company's image.  
              Advances in the interdisciplinary scientific areas that make up NDE  can have a
              direct effect on improving productivity and profits.    The Industry/University
              Cooperative Research Center for  Nondestructive Evaluation was started in 1985
              to develop a research  program thru industry/university interaction.  Wayne
              State  University plans to become an addition to this Iowa State  University
              Center expanding its research base.    This award provides funding for a
              planning meeting at Wayne State  University to determine if sufficient
              industrial support can be  developed for merging the two research programs.   
              The Principal Investigator and his colleagues are nationally  recognized
              experts in their fields.  The Industry/University  Cooperative Research Center
              for Nondestructive Evaluation and its  industry members have concurred in this
              proposal plan.    This proposal has been coordinated with Dr. Cheena
              Srinivasan,  Program Manager, Division of Design and Manufacturing, 
              Manufacturing Machines & Equipment.    The Program Manager recommends Wayne
              State University be awarded  $9,880 for 6 months for a planning meeting.
