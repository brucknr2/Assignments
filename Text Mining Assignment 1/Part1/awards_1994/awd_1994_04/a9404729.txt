Abstract    :
              9404279  Waters  In this renewal, PIs will continue and expand research on
              Chinese  echinoderm fossils, with a goal to understand echinoderm  biogeography
              and evolution in the aftermath of Late Devonian  extinction event(s) leading to
              the Carboniferous echinoderm  diversification.  Work will also contribute to
              paleoclimatic and  paleogeographic analyses, augmented by comparative studies
              of  related faunas from Europe.
