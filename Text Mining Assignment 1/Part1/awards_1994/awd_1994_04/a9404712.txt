Abstract    :
              Funds are provided for the purchase an Alexandrite laser for  nonlinear optical
              (NLO) materials research. The University is  following a long-term plan to
              significantly upgrade its Laser/NLO  Research Laboratory to support research
              activities in two areas  (i) characterization of the third-order susceptibility
              of highly  photorefractive NLO materials of interest for optical switching, 
              optical computing, and optical power limiting applications; and  (2) research
              into the properties Of gamma-irradiated color  centers and impurity doped
              crystals of interest for spectrally  tunable solid-state lasers, passive
              Q-switches, and mode-lockers.  The currently available lasers are limited to
              certain fixed  wavelengths and temporal pulse shapes. A laser source with a 
              variable wavelength and temporal pulse width is a necessity for  NLO materials
              research being performed in this laboratory. The  instrument also is useful for
              enhancing the education of the  undergraduate and graduates students who
              participate in the  laboratory.
