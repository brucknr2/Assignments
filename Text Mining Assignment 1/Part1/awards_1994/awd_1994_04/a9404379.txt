Abstract    :
              9404379  DiBenedetto  This award supports applied mathematics research on
              problems  modeled by certain degenerate and singular evolution equations.  In
              particular, intrinsic Harnack-type estimates, Holder  continuity and asymptotic
              behavior of solutions in the time and  space variables will be developed.  For
              systems of equations,  work will be done analyzing the boundary behavior of
              solutions.   The new techniques generated by these studies permit the 
              mathematical treatment of a class of applied and industrial  problems.  These
              include understanding film rupture in the  coating of metals (existence of
              solutions, rupture and behavior  for large values of the variables),
              identification of cracks in  three-dimensional bodies (stability estimates for
              elliptic  ill-posed problems) the thermistor problem and problems in the  flow
              of immiscible fluids in a porous material as the  degeneracies approach the
              saturation point.  Further work will  concentrate on problems of
              conduction/convection with change of  phase for fluids obeying either the
              Navier-Stokes system or  Darcy's law.  These involve an estimation of the
              Hausdorff  dimension of the possible singularities of the temperature.      
              Partial differential equations form a basis for mathematical  modeling of the
              physical world.  The role of mathematical  analysis is not so much to create
              the equations as it is to  provide qualitative and quantitative information
              about  the solutions.  This may include answers to questions about  uniqueness,
              smoothness and growth.  In addition, analysis often  develops methods for
              approximation of solutions and estimates  onthe accuracy of these
              approximations.  ***
