Abstract    :
              9404097  Bao       The project involves further work on differential-geometric 
              problems on Finsler spaces using a certain torsion-free  connection. It is
              proposed to establish a Gauss-Bonnet-Chern type  of theorem for a large class
              of such spaces. This research may  have potential applications to topics in
              relativity theory where  such structures arise.  ***
