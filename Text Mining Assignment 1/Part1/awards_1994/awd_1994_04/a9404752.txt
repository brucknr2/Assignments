Abstract    :
              9404752  Ausich  PI will attempt to delineate major aspects of the morphological
               diversification of the Crinoidea (crinoids) during their early  history in
              Cambrian to Ordovician time (c. 450-500 million years  ago).  Crinoids were
              among the most important marine organisms  throughout the Paleozoic, and are
              still living in today's oceans.   PI will also construct a phylogenetic
              classification of the  Crinoidea, and identify evolutionary trends, addressing 
              diversification in a context of community ecology.
