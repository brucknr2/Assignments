Abstract    :
              9404113  Yao  This award gives partial support for a postdoctoral  researcher to
              work in the theory group at Xerox Palo Alto  Research Center (PARC). 
              Postdoctoral researchers would  collaborate closely with the principal
              investigators, freely  choosing and mixing topics from current theory group 
              projects and their own areas of interest.  The two largest  projects are mesh
              generation and approximate searching.  Mesh generation requires the
              partitioning of a complicated  geometric domain into a complex of small simple
              cells.  Approximate searching requires the efficient retrieval of  data objects
              close to a given query point in a high-  dimensional space (either
              combinatorial or geometric).  Each  of these major projects covers a number of
              specific  algorithmic questions.  ***
