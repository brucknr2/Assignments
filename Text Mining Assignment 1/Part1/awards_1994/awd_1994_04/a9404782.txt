Abstract    :
              9404782  Pflugrath  The training course in Macromolecular Crystallography will
              train 16  students yearly in both the theoretical and the practical aspects  of
              macromolecular crystallography through lectures and actual  experiments.  With
              this training, students are then prepared to use  crystallographic techniques
              in their own structural biological  research.  Such complete immersive training
              in crystallography is  unavailable elsewhere.  Four principal instructors along
              with about  12 additional speakers give numerous lectures that guide students 
              through laboratory experiments and computations which ultimately  lead to the
              complete structure determination of an actual protein -   the 129 residue hen
              egg white lysozyme.  Specific experiments are  performed in protein
              crystallization, heavy atom derivatization,  crystal mounting & freezing, space
              group determination, diffraction  data collection & analysis, phase
              determination by both multiple  isomorphous replacement & molecular
              replacement, Patterson &  Fourier transform calculation, solvent flattering,
              anomalous  scattering, phase combination, electron density map interpretation, 
              restrained least squares refinement, different Fourier analysis and 
              presentation of results.  The instructors also present structures  recently
              determined in their own laboratories with an emphasis on  the methods used.  In
              addition, students are encouraged to bring  their own protein and data to try
              out the techniques and software  available during the course.  The course
              curriculum is evaluated  and updated annually in order to remain abreast of the
              latest  development in crystallography.  ***
