Abstract    :
              Jolly         The investigator and his colleague test approximate inertial 
              manifolds (AIMs) on nonlinear dissipative evolution equations,  including the
              Kuramoto-Sivashinsky, Navier-Stokes, and Lorenz  equations.  The emphasis is on
              capturing elements of the global  attractor, and not on solving the initial
              value problem over short  time intervals.  The phase space dimension reduction
              offered by  AIMs is exploited to visualize global bifurcations involving 
              two-dimensional stable manifolds, which would be of higher  dimension in
              traditional Galerkin discretizations.  Of particular  interest is an algebraic
              AIM, which offers arbitrary accuracy, at  a fixed dimension.  Increased
              accuracy in this case is achieved by  increasing the degree of a polynomial
              that implicitly defines the  AIM.  The investigators explore various time
              discretizations that  take advantage of the particular features of the
              associated  differential-algebraic system.       This research has an impact on
              how the long term behavior of  physical systems is determined by computers. 
              Part of the work is  devoted to comparing the efficiency of alternative
              algorithms to  standard ones used in high performance computing.  Another is to
               visualize certain critical phenomena, which could not be seen with 
              traditional methods, regardless of the computational effort.  While  the
              various methods will be tested on particular mathematical  models of
              combustion, fluid flow, and the weather, they are  applicable to a wide range
              of problems that fit into a general  framework.
