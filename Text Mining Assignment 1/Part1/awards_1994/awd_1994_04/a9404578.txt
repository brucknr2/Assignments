Abstract    :
              9404578  Ferry  The proposed research will evaluate how the amount and  geometry
              of fluid flow affect the mineralogical, chemical,  and isotopic evolution of
              regional and contact metamorphic  rocks.  It includes the study of siliceous
              dolomites in six  contact aureoles in a variety of  geologic settings in the 
              United States, Scotland, and Italy.  For each aureole the  spatial distribution
              of mineral assemblages and O- and C-  isotope compositions will be mapped. 
              Simple models grounded  in transport theory will be developed for each aureole
              to  predict mineral assemblages and isotopic compositions at  each point along
              sample traverses as a function of fluid  amount.  Comparison of observation
              with prediction will lead  to an understanding of both intra-aureole and
              inter-aureole  variability in flow.   Coupling of these results with  tectonic
              setting may also lead to generalizations about the  control of depth,
              lithology, and structure on the amount and  geometry of flow.
