Abstract    :
              9404673  AKYLAS      Internal gravity waves are of considerable geophysical 
              interest. Large-amplitude internal wave disturbances are common  features in
              the ocean thermocline both in deep water and in  coastal regions, as well as in
              the lower atmosphere. This work  focuses on understanding the interaction of
              long large-amplitude  internal waves with short-scale disturbances. This is a
              fully  nonlinear mechanism that is relevant to various oceanic and  atmospheric
              phenomena. For example, the coupling of solitary  internal waves with
              short-scale surface waves manifests as  surface roughness variations---the
              so-called 'surface  rips'---that often accompany internal waves in the field,
              and are  visible in radar images of the sea surface. The main objective is  to
              obtain an understanding of this nonlinear coupling mechanism  both from a
              physical and a mathematical point of view.   Particular emphasis is placed on
              calculating the amplitude of  short-wave tails induced by long internal waves.
              For this  purpose, a singular perturbation technique in the wavenumber  domain
              will be developed for weakly nonlinear disturbances, and  fully numerical
              computations will be carried out for  large-amplitude waves.
