Abstract    :
              Pitman       The investigator plans to continue present lines of research into
              stochastic  processes, particularly Brownian motion, random partitions, and
              related processes.  Particular subjects proposed for study are the following:
              random partition structures  associated with a subordinator, the two parameter
              generalization of Ewens' random  partition structure and its relation to the
              excursion theory of Brownian motion and  Bessel processes, random scaling
              operations on the paths of Brownian motion and  Bessel processes, and various
              subfiltrations of the Brownian filtration.       The investigator will continue
              present lines of research into stochastic  processes, particularly Brownian
              motion, random partitions, and related processes.  Random partitions find
              applications to combinatorics, physics, and genetics.  These  models are useful
              in the study of random phenomena involving clustering or  aggregation in a wide
              variety of contexts.  This is fundamental research into the  mathematical
              structure of stochastic processes.  Progress in this direction enhances our 
              understanding of these processes and has potential for application in numerous
              fields of  knowledge.
