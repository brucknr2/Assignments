Abstract    :
                9404107  Lee    The plan of research covers a number of topics characterizing 
              classes of Einstein metrics in Riemannian Geometry and local  embeddability of
              pseudoconvex CR-manifolds. This component of the  research may have potential
              applications to relativity theory. It  is also proposed to develop the Ricci
              software package to  implement coordinate-free tensor calculations which would
              be a  valuable tool for research in Riemannian geometry and which is  likely to
              have educational ramifications.  ***
