Abstract    :
              9404931  Taqqu       The engineering of circuit switched networks is well 
              understood because it is based on over 70 years of practical  experience.  The
              telecommunication industry, however, is moving  rapidly toward widespread
              deployment of high speed networks and  there is considerably less experience in
              the engineering and  operation of these networks.  We will investigate models
              for packet  traffic in high-speed networks that exhibit characteristics which 
              have gone unnoticed in the teletraffic literature in the past.   These models
              will be based on an in-depth statistical analyses of  actual traffic
              measurements from a number of existing packet  networks.  Moreover, high speed
              networks produce enormous amounts  of data.  Statistical techniques that can
              characterize such data  sets will be developed.  ***
