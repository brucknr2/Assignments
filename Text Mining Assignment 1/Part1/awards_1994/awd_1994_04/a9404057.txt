Abstract    :
              9404057  Bagger       Research in theoretical particle physics will focus on 
              experimental consequences of the standard model description of  the fundamental
              interactions in nature.  Special emphasis will be  placed on the interactions
              of heavy quarks, and the implications  of supersymmetry.  This symmetry relates
              the fields that describe  the forces and those that describe the constituents
              of matter.  The results of the research will further our understanding of 
              these fundamental interactions.  ***
