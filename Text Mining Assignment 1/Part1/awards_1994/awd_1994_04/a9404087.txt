Abstract    :
              9404087  Previato       The research covers aspects of Hamiltonian and
              integrable  systems as related to the geometry of algebraic curves and the 
              theory of moduli spaces of vector bundles. Several aspects of the  theory of
              theta functions will be considered in their  relationship with certain classes
              of differential equations. The  research has potential applications to other
              branches of  mathematics, mathematical physics, in particular the theory of 
              solitons.  ***
