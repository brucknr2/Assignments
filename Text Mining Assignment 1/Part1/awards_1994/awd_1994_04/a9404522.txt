Abstract    :
              9404522  Petters        The research entails applications of concepts in 
              differential geometry and singularity theory (mainly caustics) to  the study of
              deflection of light from distant sources where  matter intervenes. Such
              gravitational lensing gives insights into   distributions of matter within
              various types of galaxies. The  research has potential applications to
              theoretical astrophysics,  astronomy and general relativity.  ***
