Abstract    :
              9404637  Zelditch         The research covers several topics in the general area
              of  spectral analysis and geometry. Particular attention is to be  paid to the
              geometry of Laplace type operators and the  relationship of Schroedinger
              operators and stationary phase.  Random walks on Lie groups studied in view of
              Fourier integral  operators, is also to be pursued. The possible applications
              of  this research may apply to chaotic phenomena arising in quantum  dynamical
              systems and to other fields of current interest in  mathematical physics.  ***
