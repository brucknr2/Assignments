Abstract    :
              9404622  Wood  This project is to do the following:  1) carry out studies  of
              the hydroxide and bisulfide complexes of Pt and Pd from 0  to 90oC;  2) build
              and test a hydrothermal apparatus  required for the study of PGE mineral
              solubility at  temperatures from 300o to 600oC;  3) carry out preliminary 
              experiments on the simultaneous solubility of all six PGE  metals in chloride
              solutions from 300o to 600oC.  The  thermodynamic data determined in this study
              are crucial to  the direct modelling of PGE transport during the formation  of
              low-temperature hydrothermal PGE deposits.
