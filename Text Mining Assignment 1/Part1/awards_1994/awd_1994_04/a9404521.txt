Abstract    :
              9404521    Pernarowski       Several projects related to the bursting electrical
              activity  of the pancreatic beta cell are studied by the investigator.  Analog
              and biophysical models for single cell bursting electrical  activity are used
              to model the behavior of discrete clusters  (islets) of N coupled cells.  For
              the analog cluster model, the  steady state analysis for large N is examined in
              the context of a  mapping problem to ascertain the effect that coupling has on
              the  solution behavior.  Also, continuum limits that describe islet  electrical
              activity are examined.  These models are parabolic  partial differential
              equations that contain a small parameter.  Asymptotic analyses are used to
              examine the existence and  stability of steady states, travelling waves and
              spiral waves.       The investigator studies the difference between the 
              electrical behavior of single beta cells and clusters of beta  cells through
              the use of mathematical models.  These studies are  important because the beta
              cell is the only insulin secreting  cell  in the body and the electrical
              behavior of such clusters has been  strongly correlated to insulin release
              rate.
