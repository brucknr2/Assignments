Abstract    :
              This award is made under the Small Grants for Exploratory  Research (SGER)
              program to contribute to the funding of a  workshop on a research agenda for
              risk communication that is  responsive to the needs of practitioners and
              agencies which  conduct risk communication activities.  A national symposium
              for  invited researchers and practitioners will be held to consider a  research
              agenda to pursue communicating with different social and  cultural groups,
              approaches to environmental decision making, and  evaluation of risk
              communication.  The symposium is exploratory  and innovative because it brings
              together the researchers and the  practitioners in an area of study that is in
              high demand  institutionally although it is just beginning to develop 
              scientific methodology and techniques.  The U.S Environmental  Protection
              Agency is also contributing to this workshop.
