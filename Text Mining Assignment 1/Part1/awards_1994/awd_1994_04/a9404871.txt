Abstract    :
              9404871     Harris    This research is an experimental examination of anomalous 
              codeposition in two different systems, nickel-iron and nickel-zinc.   There are
              several reasons for choosing these particular systems:   1) to determine the
              mechanism of anomalous deposition; 2) the  systems have nickel in common, but
              the alloys produced when nickel  is combined with iron and zinc have different
              properties; 3) both  systems are of importance commercially.  Experiments
              critically  test the models or theories of anomalous codeposition.  The project
               starts with the production of alloy deposits within a test matrix  that
              includes the following variables: less noble metal  concentration in the
              solution, pH, current density, and  temperature.  The deposits produced in
              these experiments are  characterized with respect to their composition,
              morphology,  microstructure and crystalline phase content.  These tests
              identify  conditions under which anomalous codeposition does not occur, as 
              well as regimes of anomalous codeposition that are sufficiently  dissimilar to
              suggest different mechanisms.  Two additional issues  will be examined later in
              the project.  First, hypophosphite, which  is able to eliminate anomalous
              codeposition (at least in the  nickel-iron system), will be used as a probe for
              testing the  various anomalous codeposition mechanisms.  Secondly, the role of 
              hydrogen, which has been discounted in the nickel-iron system but  cannot be
              ignored with nickel-zinc, will be examined using the  electrochemical hydrogen
              permeation technique.  %%%  This work should assist in the further refinement
              of the commercial  production and utilization of electrodeposited alloys. 
              Permalloy  electrodeposition technology has played an integral role in the 
              evolution of the hard disk drive, and further improvements are  limited by our
              present understanding of the electrochemical  processing of this materials. 
              Also, a better understanding of the  nickel-zinc system should enhance its
              utilization as a corrosion-  re sistant coating for steel sheet used in
              automobiles and other  applications.  ***
