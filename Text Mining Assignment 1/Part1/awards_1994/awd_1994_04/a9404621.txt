Abstract    :
              9404621  Zeeman       The research covers aspects of dynamical systems theory 
              applied to population models of Lotka-Volterra type. These models  occur in
              behavioral sciences and ecology. The scope entails  further analysis of their
              geometric and convexity properties  relevant to the dynamics. The research has
              potential applications  to the field of ecological rates of change.  ***
