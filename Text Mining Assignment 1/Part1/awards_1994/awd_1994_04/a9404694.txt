Abstract    :
              This project, in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry
              Program, is a  continuation of Professor Kenneth J. Klabunde's studies at
              Kansas State University of  applications of "free atoms" and small particles. 
              Specific topics to be investigated include 1)  the use of metal atoms to
              produce novel arenemetal complexes of novel ligands such as sigma-  bonded
              silanes, 2) the reaction of Group 2 metal atoms with alkyl or aryl halides to
              produce  clusters that conceptionally may be considered as a combination of an
              alkyl or aryl metal halide  with a small number (1-3) of additional metal
              atoms, 3) combination of metal vapors of two  elements to small bielement
              particles as metastable alloys or mixtures, and 4) generation of  colloids by
              deposition of metal vapors into organic solvents and their applications in
              generating  films of metals on polymeric substrates.    Condensation of gaseous
              metal atoms is rapidly becoming an important method of generating  new
              materials with many interesting and important technological applications.  This
              project is  concerned with the fundamental understanding of exactly how metal
              atoms combine together,  and with other reactive species, to give materials
              with specific properties.
