Abstract    :
              9404647  Gellenbeck  St. Francis College requests support from NSF for
              connection of its  campus network to PREPnet.  PREPnet is the midlevel network
              located  in the state of Pennsylvania.  PREPnet will provide operations 
              management and information services and it will give St. Francis  College
              connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million  bits per second)
              National Backbone network.    The College needs greater functionality and
              network speed to be  able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file
              transfers  along with being able to implement a more reliable mail system. 
              Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.  This is  also a
              unique opportunity for the school to explore innovative  educational resources.
