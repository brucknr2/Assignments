Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to study the formation and evolution  of large
              scale plasma structures in the high latitude ionosphere.   The plasma
              structures to be studied are 100 to 1000 km scale  enhancements of the F region
              plasma density.  The program combines  observations with numerical modeling. 
              The observational program  consists of coordinated measurements using the
              Sondrestrom and  EISCAT radars, as well as other ground-based instruments.  The
               modeling effort involves simulations guided by both specific  observations and
              various theoretical scenarios.  In support of this  effort, an existing
              high-latitude F-region model will be improved  as needed to include
              multi-species, E-region chemistry, and  calculations of the ion and electron
              temperatures.  The primary  goal of this effort is to understand the mechanisms
              that control  the appearance, size, and shape of the plasma patches in the
              polar  cap and the ionization enhancements in the auroral oval.  The  results
              will provide valuable insights into the physics of  magnetosphere-ionosphere
              coupling.
