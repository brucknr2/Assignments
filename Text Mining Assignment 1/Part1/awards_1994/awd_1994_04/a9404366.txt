Abstract    :
              9404366  Fu       The scope of research is concerned with the methods of 
              characteristic cycles to analyse the geometric structures of  classes of
              singular spaces. The techniques arise from complex  geometry and representation
              theory. Another component of the  research involves curvature measures of
              singular metrics in  Riemannian geometry. The research has potential
              applications to  other branches of mathematics including algebraic geometry, 
              number theory and may have applications to mathematical physics.  ***
