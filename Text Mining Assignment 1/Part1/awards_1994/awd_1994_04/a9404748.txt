Abstract    :
              Demmel  9404748  We propose to parallelize a global atmospheric chemical tracer
              model.  This is part of a larger Earth Systems Model (ESM) being built which
              will include a atmospheric chemistry.  The ESM will be used for global warming
              and ozone depletion studies, among others.
