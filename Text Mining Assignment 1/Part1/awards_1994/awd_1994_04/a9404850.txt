Abstract    :
                9404850     Ekdale    PI will describe trace fossils and ichnofabrics of the
              "Orthoceras  limestones" in their stratigraphic and paleoenvironmental
              contexts,  and thereby interpret the nature and structure of the infaunal 
              organism communities.  These fossils represent the only record of  soft-bodied
              organisms during the early Ordovician, a time of first  expansion of
              endobenthos following the Cambrian oxygen crisis in  this area.  Study will
              also reconstruct original substrate  conditions, and the stages of compaction,
              cementation, and  diagenesis as time progressed.
