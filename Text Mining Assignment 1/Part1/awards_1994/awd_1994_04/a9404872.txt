Abstract    :
              9404872  Means       A common problem in tectonic fabric analysis is to relate
              with  confidence observable fabric features to particular tectonic  processes. 
              This problem is made more difficult by the high  temperatures and sluggish
              kinematics that are typical for silicate  minerals.  This work follows
              considerable prior research using  analog materials that are near the melting
              point at room  temperature.  The deformational behavior of solid frameworks of 
              crystalline grains with intercrystalline melt present will be  modeled by a
              mixture of three crystalline ammonium compounds.   Similarly, the growth of
              prophyroblasts over existing fabrics will  be investigated.  Results will
              provide unique insights into the  formation of deformation fabrics.
