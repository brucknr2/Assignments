Abstract    :
              9404039  Walker  The PIs for this project will conduct exploratory research  on
              lithium isotopes (6Li-7Li) in several earth science  systems.   These isotopes
              have the potential for use as  conservative hydrologic tracers and also as
              tracers of  magmatic evolution.  The research will utilize newly  developed
              techniques for thermal ionization mass  spectrometric analysis to investigate
              (1) the effects of  high-temperature magmatic fractionation on Li isotopes in a
               well characterized suite of Hawaiian basalts, (2) the  variation of Li isotope
              compositions in a suite of related  granites from the Black Hills of South
              Dakota, and (3) Li  isotopic variations in a controlled hydrologic test area.
