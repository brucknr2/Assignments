Abstract    :
              9404523  Weinstein        The research involves several topics in general
              relativity  theory relating to rotating black holes in equilibrium. Certain 
              problems can be seen in the setting of variational principles  when the
              defining equations give rise to energy minimizing maps  to symmetric spaces of
              non-compact type.  Other problems relate to configurations of massive bodies in
              a  perfect fluid. The research has applications to cosmology and  relativistic
              fluid mechanics.  ***
