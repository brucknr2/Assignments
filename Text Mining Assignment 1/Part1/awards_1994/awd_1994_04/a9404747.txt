Abstract    :
              9404747  This renewal grant involves research on solvable models for 
              statistical mechanics and quantum field theory.  Work will be done  on
              extending research on the excitations and the completeness rules  to the full
              phase diagram of the three-state chiral Potts model.   It will be determined
              how the excitation spectrum of the  ferromagnetic and massively superintegrable
              cases, which have  strikingly different features, actually join together in a
              smooth  fashion.  The manner in which the level crossing phenomena of the 
              massless incommensurate phase allows for the systems to  continuously go from
              the ferromagnetic case to the  antiferromagnetic case will be studied. 
              Investigations of the  fermionic sum representations of characters will be
              extended by  finding the representations for the twisted affine and super 
              algebras.  %%%  This theoretical research is at the interface between condensed
               matter physics, mathematical physics and applied mathematics.   Using powerful
              mathematical techniques, connections between quantum  field theory and
              statistical mechanics will be utilized to  understand the properties of various
              condensed matter systems at a  fundamental level.
