Abstract    :
                     9404609  Cook          This project involves a cultural anthropologist
              from the  University of Connecticut studying the social relations, and use  of
              capital in manufacturing enterprises in the small-scale  artisan brick industry
              of the Mexico-Texas border.  Using  techniques of in-depth interviews with
              owners, managers and brick  workers, the project will try to understand how the
              low-  technology Mexican industry survives and co-exists alongside the  heavily
              capitalized and more high technology US industry.  The  project will test
              alternative theoretical explanations for the  coexistence of these firms,
              analyzing theories drawn from  literature glossed as modernization,
              subsumption, flexible  accumulation, endo-accumulation, and technical/applied.
              Different  theoretical approaches predict different outcomes for the 
              interaction of the artisan-type brick works with industrial-type  works.     
              This research is important because the existence of NAFTA  will expand
              cross-border economic relations.  Our understanding  will be advanced by
              studying how the two economic styles relate  to each other, not from a simple
              perspective that the more  heavily capitalized North American side will
              dominate the  exchange, but from the perspective of seeing what has developed 
              in one industry over time as a case study.
