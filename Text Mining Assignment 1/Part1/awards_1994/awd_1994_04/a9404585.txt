Abstract    :
              This project studies the statistics of estimated rotations with  especial
              concentration on problems which arise in the  reconstructions of tectonic
              plates.  We propose to adapt our  previous work on M-estimators for spherical
              regressions to the  types of data which arise in such reconstructions.  We also
               propose to develop methodology for a statistical test of the  fixed hot spot
              hypothesis.  One component of this problem will be  to develop methodology for
              use with contoured data.  We propose  to continue our work on splining together
              fitted rotations and  developing a confidence band for the fitted path. 
              Finally, we  propose to continue our work on Behrens Fisher type problems 
              which arise when data of different types are used to calculate a 
              reconstruction.  This project is to study the statistical  properties of
              estimated rotations.  Such problems arise in the  statistical estimation of the
              motion of rigid bodies on the  sphere and in Euclidean space or in the
              statistical estimation of  an unknown coordinate system.  Of these potential
              applications,  the most scientifically compelling application of this line of 
              research is the statistical determination of the errors in  tectonic plate
              reconstructions.  The proposal will concentrate on  studying the types of
              problems which arise in the tectonic  context.
