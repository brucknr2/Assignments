Abstract    :
              Greenberg  9404734  This proposal is for an investigation in the emerging area
              of applications of artificial intelligence (AI) for solving large
              multidisciplinary numerical problems.  Artificial neural network (ANN)
              paradigms will be explored to generate intelligent solution strategies using
              adaptive and parallel multilevel solvers for large systems involving general
              3-D models, where the lack of regular structure makes it hard to use existing
              multilevel techniques.  We propose to study fast and massively parallel
              artificial neural network algorithms for seeking solutions of multivariate
              non-convex optimization problems and investigate AI-guided multilevel solvers.
