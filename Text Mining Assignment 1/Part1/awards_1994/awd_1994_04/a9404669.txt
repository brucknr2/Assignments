Abstract    :
               This project develops optimizations based on object behavior  prediction to
              improve the performance of manual and automatic  storage  reclamation
              algorithms. Programs written in languages such  as C, C++, or Fortran  that use
              manual garbage collection, and  program written in language such as  Common
              Lisp, ML, Smalltalk, or Modula-3 which uses automatic storage reclamation 
              benefit  from the techniques developed in this project.    The project   uses
              profile-based optimizations to predict  properties of allocated objects at  the
              time they are allocated.  The properties include object lifetime and object 
              reference  behavior. By correctly predicting these properties, the space 
              usage,  CPU overhead, and reference locality of programs using  either manual
              or  automatic storage reclamation is improved.    The project first 
              investigate empirical properties of  program in languages using manual  and 
              automatic storage  reclamation and determines if behavior prediction is
              feasible.  Then the project develops and evaluates alternative algorithms  that
              exploit  observed predictable behaviors.  Finally, the  project prototypes the
              most  promising algorithms and  measures their performance.
