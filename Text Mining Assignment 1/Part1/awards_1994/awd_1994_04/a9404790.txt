Abstract    :
              9404790  Blanpied       Research will be performed at the Laser Electron Gamma 
              Source (LEGS) at the National Synchrotron Light Source of  Brookhaven National
              Laboratory, at SATURNE in Saclay, France, and  at ELSA in Bonn, Germany. 
              Planning for experiments using the  CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS)
              will be carried out.  At LEGS, using tagged polarized gammarays of energies up
              to 320  MeV, photo disintegration of the deuteron and the E2/M1 ratio of  the
              Delta has been studied.  Measurements of pion production and  Compton
              scattering will be performed.  Measurements of the  polarizabilities of the
              proton, neutron and pion are in  preparation.  At CEBAF continued participation
              in the  construction of the CLAS is planned.  At CEBAF continued  development
              of a proposal to measure lepton pair production in  order to study the photo
              production of vector mesons in nuclei  and possible reduction of the mass of
              these mesons in the nuclear  medium will be carried out.  ***
