Abstract    :
              9404875  Grand                            This research is a continuation of
              efforts to map the three-  dimensional shear wave structure of the earth's
              mantle.   Previously, the travel times of S, ScS and multiple bounce S phases 
              have been measured and inverted to obtain a 3-D model of mantle  structure
              beneath the Americas.  New data will be collected from  different types of
              seismic phases, SKS, SKKS, and multiple S, and  from new station-earthquake
              combinations to increase the resolution  and range of the previous results. 
              New areas of study will include  the upper mantle of Asia, Africa, and the
              northern Indian ocean.   The results will provide resolution of mantle
              anomalies and  questions such as the ultimate fate of subducting slabs, the
              origin  of hotspots, and nature of mantle convection.  ***
