Abstract    :
              With this award the Arctic Research Consortium of the United States (ARCUS) has
              entered into a three year cooperative agreement with the National Science
              Foundation's Office of Polar Programs.  This agreement will facilitate the 
              continuing development, promotion, and implementation of the Arctic System
              Science (ARCSS) Program, with special emphasis on integrating and synthesizing
              its various parts, and to broaden ARCSS so that it involves other presently
              neglected areas such as the human aspect of global change.  ARCUS will work to
              increase communication among arctic researchers, academic institutions, federal
              agencies, and logistical field facilities and projects; to inform
              policy-makers, funding sources (federal agencies, private foundations,
              corporate bodies), and educators on the need, opportunities, and benefits in
              arctic research; and to improve offerings and programs in arctic science
              education.  ARCUS will facilitate an Arctic Week, combining several of these
              activities to increase participation of all interested arctic groups and
              individuals, to foster interdisciplinary exchanges and to make the most
              effective use of available resources.
