Abstract    :
              Dlott  The goal of this research is a better understanding of the  fundamental
              mechanisms by which a short intense laser pulse  modifies the properties of a
              micrometer scale spot on a polymer  thin film.  The processes which will be
              studied are laser surface  ablation and laser photopolymerization. 
              Microchemistry processes  are widely used in photomicrolithography,
              electronics, and many  other high technology industries, but due to the
              complicated nature  of the laser-material interaction and the diversity and
              complexity  of the materials used therein, are poorly understood at a 
              fundamental level.  Specific practical applications discussed here  include
              laser ablation, microimage formation, laser assisted  material transfer, and
              shock-based methods involving fast  compression, shearing and smashing.  The
              intent of this work is to  go beyond the current level of understanding these
              processes at a  technical level to develop a detailed molecular level 
              understanding.   %%%  The goal of this research is a better understanding of
