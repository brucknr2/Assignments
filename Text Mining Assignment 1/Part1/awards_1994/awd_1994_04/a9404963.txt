Abstract    :
              9404963  Mann       The Kamchatka Peninsula is the site of shallow subduction of
               the Hawaii-Emperor seamount chain.  subduction of these seamounts  (and the
              associated ridge) have perturbed the sear-level record on  the peninsula and
              also the volcanic activity associated with  subduction of the Pacific plate. 
              This project is to help constrain  the deformational response, age of
              deformation, and rate and style  of uplift of this area. It will be
              investigated in cooperation with  the Russian Academy of Science.  The results
              should provide an  improved basics for interpreting the complex structural and 
              geochemical effects of seamounts on still active and ancient arc  systems.
