Abstract    :
              9404528  Goodman        We will study nonlinear dispersive waves by combining
              the normal forms  technique of dynamical systems with nonlinear harmonic
              analysis. We will study  multi-D perturbations of plane wave solutions of
              systems of reaction-diffusion  equations, attempting to relate simple effective
              equations to the full  equations. We will develop and analyze numerical methods
              for stochastic  differential equations with special attention to boundaries. 
              Nonlinear  dispersive waves include waves on the surface of water and sound
              waves in a  crystal lattice of atoms. Reaction diffusion equations describe,
              among other  things, flames. Understanding of instabilities of flames is
              important, for  example, in chemical engineering. Stochastic differential
              equations are used  to model molecules in modern drug design, stock price and
              interest rate  movements (important in New York City), and many other things.
              Efficient and  accurate simulation technology is sorely needed in these areas.
