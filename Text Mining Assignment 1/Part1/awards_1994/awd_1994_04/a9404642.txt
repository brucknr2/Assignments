Abstract    :
              9404642  Cattani       The topics covered in the scope of research include the 
              study of polarized variations of Hodge structures with  applications to the
              mirror-symmetry conjecture for Calabi-Yau  spaces. Further problems related to
              the variation of Hodge  structure, compactification of moduli spaces and
              computation of  multidimensional residues will also be pursued. The research
              has  potential applications to algebraic geometry and superstring  theory in
              mathematical physics.  ***
