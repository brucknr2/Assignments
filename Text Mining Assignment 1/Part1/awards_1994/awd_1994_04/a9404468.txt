Abstract    :
              9404468  Segert       The scope of research entails studying the geometry and 
              analysis of Yang-Mills fields in mathematical physics in  particular the nature
              of the non-self-dual fields and their  topological significance. It is also
              proposed to consider the  existence of locally almost complex structures on the
              six-  dimensional sphere. This research has potential applications to  gauge
              field theory in mathematical physics.  ***
