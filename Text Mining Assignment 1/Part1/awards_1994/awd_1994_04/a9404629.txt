Abstract    :
                Relational query languages, such as SQL, were the early success  stories of
              declarative programming.  However, as new applications  areas have developed,
              relational systems have been found wanting.   Their limitations--both
              structural and language related--have led  databases and deductive databases. 
              Object-oriented databases  (abbr., O-O) are effective when the structure of the
              data is well-  known and the data access paths and retrieval methods can be 
              determined at system development time.  Deductive DBMS, based on  logic, are
              appropriate in less well-defined situations; situations  where one does not
              know before-hand all the queries that will be  asked.    Flexibility is
              extremely important for modern DBMS, especially when  the user lacks detailed
              knowledge about the structure of the  application domain.  For this reason,
              logic-base languages have  traditionally been used whenever intelligent
              processing of data was  required.  On the other hand, flat data structures
              inherent in such  languages are ill-suited for many scientific applications,
              CAD/CAM  design, modeling agile manufacturing processing, etc., where data  has
              complex and known internal structure.
