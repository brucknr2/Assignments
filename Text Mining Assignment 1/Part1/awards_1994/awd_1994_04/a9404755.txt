Abstract    :
              9404755  Zettl    The electronic and thermal properties of fullerene-based
              materials,  pure and alkali-doped carbon-60 and carbon-70, will be examined 
              using various transport, structural, mechanical and tunneling  measurements. 
              Electron phonon coupling in the normal and  superconducting states will be
              investigated through transport,  tunneling, and isotopic replacement on both
              the alkali and carbon  sites.  Carrier concentration and possible
              correlation-induced  localization effects will be explored using Hall
              measurements.   High pressures will be applied to probe transport properties
              and  superconductivity as a function of lattice constants and variable  density
              of states.    % % % %    The properties of novel carbon materials formed from
              so called  fullerenes will be explored using a variety of probes, including 
              transport of electricity and heat through the materials at  atmospheric and
              high pressures.  The mechanical strength of the  structures will be determined
              using elasticity measurements.  Atoms  of different masses (different isotopes)
              will be introduced in the  structures to help understand the interactions
              between the  electrons and the vibrations of the atoms.  This interaction may
              be  responsible for some of the materials being superconducting (zero 
              electrical resistance).  ***
