Abstract    :
                9404437  Sinai       The proposed research will concern three different
              topics.  The first is the study of ergodic like properties of  standard-like
              maps. The main difficulty is due to the fact that  in these cases, stable and
              unstable foliations are never  transversal to each other. The new ideas and
              methods are taken  from the theory of hyperbolic billiards. In the second
              topic, we  shall study quasi-linear equations with random initial data and 
              random coefficients. These equations appear in some cosmological  problems. The
              analysis of statistical properties lead to new very  interesting problems in
              probability theory. The third topic deals  with some mathematical problems in
              the theory of quantum chaos.  This is a new direction in mathematical physics
              which can be very  promising.       In general, we shall deal with several
              basic problems in the  theory of chaos. The first one can be considered the
              most  important open problem in Hamiltonian dynamics and concerns the 
              appearance of chaotic behavior from pure deterministic laws of  motion. The
              second one deals with equations of continuous media  where the randomness is
              incorporated through initial data. It has  important applications in cosmology.
              The last one concerns a new  and difficult topic called quantum chaos and is of
              big interest  for physics and mathematics.  ***
