Abstract    :
              9404089  Freire       The research covers topics concerned with the spectrum of 
              the Laplacian on complete non-compact Riemannian manifolds,  mainly in the case
              of nonnegative curvature. Asymptotic methods  are expected to give new results
              concerning the spectral analysis  of harmonic differential forms. The
              Yang-Mills flow technique  will also be studied to determine uniqueness of
              solutions of  partial differential equations. The research has potential 
              applications to mathematical physics, in particular, gauge field  theory.  ***
