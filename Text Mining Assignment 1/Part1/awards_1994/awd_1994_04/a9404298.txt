Abstract    :
              9404298  Gordon       The research supported by this award focuses on questions 
              related to the geometry of manifolds.  It concerned with the  determination of
              the extent to which the spectrum of the Laplace-  Beltrami operator of a
              compact Riemannian manifold determines the  geometry of the manifold.  Recent
              examples show, for instance,  that the spectrum alone does not determine
              manifolds up to  isometry.  Further work will also be done in efforts to 
              understand how manifolds can be isospectral yet not even locally  isometric. 
              Examples growing out of these examples provide  excellent opportunities to
              identify specific local geometric  invariants which are not spectrally
              determined.  Work related to  isospectral plane domains will also continue. 
              Constructions of  such domains are surprisingly simple; they arise as
              underlying  spaces of certain orbifolds.  Using this method, work will be  done
              to establish whether or not it is possible to construct  isospectral sets of
              non-isometric plane domains of any finite  order.  Finally, studies on Laplace
              versus length spectra of  hyperbolic manifolds and on the Schrodinger operator
              on tori and  Heisenberg manifolds will be carried out.       Analysis of
              domains and manifolds through the study of  classical differential operators
              defined on these spaces is now  an established field of geometric analysis. 
              One knows that  geometric properties of the domains are intertwined with 
              properties of the spectrum of the operators.  Results of the last  decade show
              that the dependence is not as simple as once thought.       This work seeks to
              clarify the connections and broaden the  scope of the theory's applications.
