Abstract    :
              Abstract - Caneba - 9404156      Understanding and control of commercial-scale
              polymerization reaction processes is important in the production of
              high-quality polymer products.  Free-radical polymerization processes sometimes
              have temperature and molecular weight control problems.  The PI is planning to
              study the physico-chemical and product material aspects of a free-radical
              precipitation polymerization reaction system wherein phase separation occurs as
              the temperature and molecular weight increase.  This is in contrast with
              conventional precipitation polymerization processes that involve phase
              separation as the temperature decreases.  The PI calls this new process
              "free-radical retrograde precipitation polymerization (FRRPP).  This process
              has the potential to produce "designer" molecules with specific end groups and
              a narrow, tightly controlled molecular weight distribution as well as block
              copolymers, at lower pressures, which makes the process economically
              attractive.    In order to obtain a fundamental understanding of the FRRPP
              process, the PI plans to: (1) do gel effect modeling of the FRRPP system; (2)
              do in-situ pulsed NMR experiments during polymerization; (3) develop a ternary
              phase diagram of the polymer-monomer-solvent system through diode-array light
              scattering and pulsed NMR methods; and (4) determine the kinetic coefficients
              through batch polymerization  and ESR experiments.  These kinetic studies will
              be carried out through measurements of conversion, molecular weight
              distribution as well as radical concentrations versus reaction time.
