Abstract    :
              9404481  Getzler        The research entails a number of topics in the
              relatively  new area of topological field theory with applies methods of 
              homological algebra and algebraic topology to concepts in modern  quantum field
              theory and superstrings. Particular importance will  be paid to the development
              of the cyclic Chern character and the  index of classes of pseudodifferential
              operators in the setting  of non-commutative differential geometry. The topics
              studied here  are considered as fundamental in modern mathematical physics.
