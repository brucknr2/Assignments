Abstract    :
              Sethian  9404904  This proposal will develop a new approach to shape modeling
              which retains the most attractive features of existing methods, and overcomes
              their prominent limitations.  The technique can be applied to model arbitrarily
              complex shapes, which include shapes with significant protrusions, and to
              situations where no a priori assumption about the object's topology is made.
