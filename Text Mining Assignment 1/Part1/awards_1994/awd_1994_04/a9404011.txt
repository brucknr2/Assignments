Abstract    :
                9404011  Klann  This is an individual Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
              Plant Biology award.  The Fellow received her Ph.D. from University of
              California at Davis.  Her Ph.D. thesis research was in the area of plant
              biochemistry and physiology.  She will carry out her postdoctoral fellowship
              research in the laboratory of Dr. Peter Hepler at University of Massachusetts. 
              The proposed research is entitled "Determination of the site of cell division
              in Adiantum protonemata".  The postdoctoral experience will expand her
              scientific expertise to cell biology.   The research training plan includes 6
              month visit to the Australian National University in Canberra City.
