Abstract    :
              Almlof  9404902  The self-consistent-field (SCF) method is severely limited by
              the computational cost of assembling the Fock matrix.  This research will
              address this problem by separating the long-range, classical electrostatic
              contributions to the Fock matrix from those involving local, quantum
              interactions.  A portable, scable SCF code will be developed which will, for
              the first time, systematize the most demanding part of an SCF calculation.
