Abstract    :
              Most research into work hours over the past thirty years has  focused on
              explanations for differences among individuals in  their work behavior.  There
              has been little analysis of changes  in work hours over time.  The purpose of
              this research is to  undertake a detailed examination of hours of work since
              1975 and  to do so with sufficiently disaggregated data to identify 
              differences in the movements of work hours among various types of  workers. 
              Since the late 1970s, relative wages have become more  unequal.  It is
              important to determine whether this development  in the wage structure has been
              associated with changes in work  behavior.  To what extent has the growing
              inequality in earning  been the product of the conversion of full-time,
              full-year, jobs  into part-time jobs or through greater unemployment into part-
               year jobs?  This project will provide detailed analysis of the  relationship
              over these years between work behavior and wage  rates.  The principal source
              of data will be the March  demographic files of the Current Population Survey
              which, since  the 1976 Survey, provide information on the hours worked and 
              weeks worked of respondents.
