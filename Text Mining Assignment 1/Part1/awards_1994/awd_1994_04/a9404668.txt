Abstract    :
              9404668  Phillips    This Americas Program award will fund travel and  related
              expenses on a research project in the area of  polymeric materials.  The
              collaborators are Professors  Paul Phillips, University of Tennessee, Francisco
               Medellin-Rodriguez, University of San Luis Potosi,  Mexico, and Dr. J.S. Lin,
              of Oak Ridge National  Laboratories.  In-situ studies of secondary 
              crystallization in a series of aromatic polyesters  will be carried out, with
              the goal of understanding  the molecular features that control crystallization 
              and other properties of this important series of  commercial polymers.     
              Earlier studies have not produced a well-defined  molecular mechanism for the
              secondary crystallization  process.  This proposal will consider a new possible
               mechanism, based on experimental observations from  previous studies.  Much of
              the experimental work will  be carried out at Oak Ridge National Laboratories, 
              which is making its small-angle X-ray scattering  research facilities available
              to Dr. Medellin.  Other  components of the research will be carried out at the 
              University of Tennessee and at the University of San  Luis Potosi.  ***
