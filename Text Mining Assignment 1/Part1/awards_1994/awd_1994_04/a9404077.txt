Abstract    :
              9404077  SHAW      Temporal variation in the particulate flux to the deep
              sediment  community drives variation in benthic respiration and the  deposition
              of particle bound nutrients and minor elements.  Particulate flux can be
              measured on a near continuous basis with  sequencing sediment traps.  However,
              particulate decomposition and  the resultant benthic flux of dissolved species
              has been measured  only for brief periods seasonally in the deep ocean.  To
              address  the need for more frequent measurements, a bottom transecting free 
              vehicle "Rover" is being built to collect near continuous data on  benthic
              community oxygen utilization.  Complimentary measurement of  the benthic flux
              of nutrients and minor elements will elucidate the  relationship between
              productivity and burial for particle bound  species. This project involves
              building a long development sampler  to collect and preserve benthic chamber
              sampler which will  "piggyback" the "Rover".  The sampler will be made up of
              the  controller and a series of syringe racks.  Each rack will have the 
              capability of collecting and preserving 18 chamber samples in  duplicate.  The
              controller will have the capacity to collect from  eight racks.  Four racks
              will be built for this project allowing  six collections each for twelve
              emplacements of the benthic chamber  over a six month deployment.  This
              sampling frequency will allow a  greater understanding of the seasonal
              variability of the  biogeochemical cycling of nutrients and trace elements at
              the  sediment water interface.
