Abstract    :
                9404728  Bales    This Americas Program award will support a collaborative 
              research project  between Dr. Roger Bales, University of  Arizona, and Dr.
              Fernando A. Escobar, Direccion General  de Aguas, Chile.  The goal of the
              research is to understand  the linkages between the processes controlling snow 
              accumulation and melt in alpine catchments of the Chilean  Andes.  This
              understanding is critical to developing a  predictive ability to describe the
              response of a basin to  inputs of water and energy, and to changes in this
              input.   A spatially distributed energy-`alance model of snowmelt  runoff will
              be developed and will be evaluated for its  forecasting capabilities and its
              sensitivity to parameters  and data errors.        Seasonally snow-covered
              areas of the Earth's mountain  ranges are important components of the global
              hydrologic  cycle and are sensitive indicators of climatic change.   Snowmelt
              runoff in these areas accounts for the major  source of the runoff for stream
              flow and ground-water  recharge over wide areas of the mid-latitudes.  It is 
              therefore important to understand the processes  controlling this runoff in
              order to model stream flow for  water supply and flood prediction purposes.  A
              long-term  result of this project will be the firm establishment of 
              cooperation between the two research teams and the  incorporation of Andean
              basins to system of study sites  located around the globe.    ***
