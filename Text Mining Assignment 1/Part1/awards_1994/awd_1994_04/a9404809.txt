Abstract    :
              9404809  Chen                             This research is a collaboration
              between the University of  Illinois and Purdue University to analyze
              short-period and broad-  band seismic waveform data from the northwestern
              Pacific.  Because  of the complex tectonic setting and major subduction zones
              in the  area, pronounced variation in lithospheric and upper mantle  structure
              is expected near this margin.  Using high-resolution  seismic waveform data, a
              detailed study of such variation can place  additional constraints on mantle
              dynamics and mineral physics.   Using high-quality seismic data from the
              broad-band networks, the  proposed work complements existing long-period and
              travel time  studies in this region.    ***
