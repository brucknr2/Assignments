Abstract    :
              Houstis  9404859  This project focuses on creating systems and tools for
              scientific applications that require the solution of complex partial
              differential equations (PDEs) in two or three dimensions.  It will enable the
              rapid and easy development of systems to model scientific phenomenon with PDEs.
               An intelligent interface to support the tools on mobile platforms, will
              minimize the communication between the mobile device and the static hosts which
              give access to HPC (High Performance Computing) hardware.
