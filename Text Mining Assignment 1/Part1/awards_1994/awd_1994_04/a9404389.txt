Abstract    :
              9404389  Dunster       Uniform asymptotic approximations are to be derived for a
               number of special functions, which will be more general than  previous results
              and include explicit error bounds. The  functions to be studied will include
              Mathieu, Legendre,  Jacobi, and spheroidal functions, for the cases where the 
              parameters or the independent variables are too large. The  general theory of a
              coalescing turning point and simple pole  as developed by the principal;
              investigator will be applied  to these functions. In the case of Mathieu
              functions the  principal investigator will extend the asymptotic results  that
              were obtained earlier to larger parameter regimes, and  to use these to
              investigate the distribution of the  eigenvalues. In addition, it is proposed
              to derive new  representations for solutions of second-order linear 
              differential equations with a large parameter, and the  Riemann zeta function
              of large argument, using convergent  factorial series and
              exponentially-improved asymptotic  expansions.       The expansion of special
              functions and their properties  plays an important role in explicit solutions
              of many of the  equations of applied mathematics.  This project deals with 
              asymptotic approximation that includes error bounds. Error  bounds are
              especially useful in numerical computations.  Potential applications of these
              new results include  tunneling in wave physics, elasticity, high-frequency 
              scattering, and various problems in quantum mechanics.  ***
