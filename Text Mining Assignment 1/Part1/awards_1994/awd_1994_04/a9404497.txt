Abstract    :
              9404497  Oshea       The project will adapt methods for obtaining qualitative 
              geometric information concerning singularities of complex  analytic sets
              relative to real algebraic geometry In particular,  the study of the space of
              limiting tangent hyperplanes will be  undertaken. This research intends to
              increase the understanding  of topics in real algebraic geometry which are
              significantly  different from their complex counterparts. The research has 
              potential to computer graphics in an educational setting.  Participation of
              undergraduate students is expected.    ***
