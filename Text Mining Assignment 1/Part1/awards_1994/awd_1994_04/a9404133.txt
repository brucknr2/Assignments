Abstract    :
              9404133  Kushner  The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) has set the  goal
              to achieve industry wide ).18um feature sizes in  microelectronics devices by
              2001 for wafer sizes as large as  40cm.  These goals place extremely tight and
              tolerances on  the uniformities of ion and radical fluxes to the surface  are
              governed by the uniformity of their generation and the  uniformity of potential
              gradients or flow fields which drive  them to the substrate.  These fluxes and
              gradients are  highly sensitive to electrode topography which perturbs the 
              plasma. Examples of electrode topography are the wafer  itself, protruding
              clips from wafer holders bolt holes, and  discontinuities in electrode
              materials on otherwise smooth  surfaces.  Plasma properties can even be
              influenced by  metals or or dielectrics placed under the wafer.  The 
              researchers  propose to perform a program of computer  modeling to assess how
              electrode topography affects the  uniformity of ion and radical fluxes to the
              substrate in  plasma processing reactors, and propose methods to remediate  or
              capitalize on those effects.  In this effort we will  build upon and further
              develop existing 2-dimensional hybird  models of plasma etching and deposition
              reactors.  The  consequences of electrode topography on plasma properties  will
              be assessed with regard to etching trench profiles,  dust particle traps, and
              differential wafer charging.
