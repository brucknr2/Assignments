Abstract    :
              9404954  This is a renewal grant which focuses on calculating the electronic 
              structure of the high temperature superconductors in order to  assess the role
              of the electron-phonon interaction.  First  principles calculations will be
              done using a newly developed  linearized augmented plane wave linear response
              method.  Some of  the work will be done in collaboration with the theory group
              at the  Naval Research Laboratory.  %%%  Calculations will be done to determine
              properties of the high  temperature superconductors.  The results of this work
              will not  only help us understand the basic structure of these materials, but 
              it may shed light on the underlying mechanisms which cause these  insulating
              materials to become superconductors.
