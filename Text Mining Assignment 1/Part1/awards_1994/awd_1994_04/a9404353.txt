Abstract    :
              9404353  Saiidi  This project is to hold a workshop for the principal 
              investigators who have worked on hazard mitigation projects  funded by the
              National Science Foundation.  The principal  investigators will make
              presentations about their research  work in progress.  This workshop will
              provide an opportunity  to the PIs to discuss their research approach with
              other  PIs, learn about other on-going research projects and  exchange valuable
              scientific information well before its  publication in Scientific literature.
