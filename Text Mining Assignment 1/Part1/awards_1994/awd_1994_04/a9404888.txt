Abstract    :
              Kalos  9404888  This proposed research plan will design, implement, and apply a
              parallel path-integral Monte Carlo method.  PIMC program using the massively
              parallel IBM SP-2.  The parallel program will use a robust, general, and tested
              serial PIMC code as a starting point.  We will initially apply the code to the
              long-standing and unsolved question involving the nature of the so-called
              plasma phase transition.
