Abstract    :
              9404908  Futrelle     The full text of the scientific literature is becoming
              more and more available in electronic form.  Techniques will be developed for
              machine learning of the syntactic and semantic structures in scientific text.
              Unsupervised learning, which has been successful in discovering syntactic and
              semantic word classes, will be extended to more complex tasks.  Supervised
              learning will be used to set the unsupervised results in the standard context
              of parts of speech (noun, adjective, verb), structures (noun and verb phrases,
              prepositional phrases) and relations (coreference, apposition, prepositional
              phrase attachment).  The character-stream-based approach used in past corpus
              studies will be replaced by an object-oriented database approach, which will
              integrate smoothly with case-based techniques already developed.  The database
              approach makes it possible to build information-rich indexes as new relations
              are discovered.  The indexes, in turn, make further analyses more flexible and
              efficient.  The research will use the electronic forms of the journals of the
              American Society for Microbiology.  The result of the research will be to
              introduce a collection of powerful and flexible new techniques to analyze
              complex text and extract the basic conceptual content from it.  The content can
              then serve as the basis for building powerful information retrieval systems.
