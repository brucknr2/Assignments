Abstract    :
              9404541  Butler       This award provides partial funding (67%) necessary to 
              acquire a cryogenic magnetometer and associated equipment to  be installed and
              operated in the Paleomagnetics Laboratory  of the Department of Geosciences at
              the University of  Arizona. The institution is committed to providing the 
              remaining funds needed to acquire the equipment.       The equipment will be
              used mainly by the Principal  Investigator, colleagues and students in research
              aimed at  understanding the relationship between the past record of  the
              Earth's magnetic field as measured in ancient rocks and  the past migration of
              tectonic plates in which the rocks are  found.  ***
