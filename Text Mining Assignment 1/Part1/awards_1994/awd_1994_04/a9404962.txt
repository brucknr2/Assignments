Abstract    :
              9404962  Ward                             This research is to analyze the
              regularity of recurrence of large  earthquakes (M greater than 7) from major
              plate boundaries around  the world.  Regularity of earthquake recurrence is a
              critical input  into many seismic hazard studies.  Many of the previous studies
              of  earthquake recurrence have concentrated on "characteristic", 
              segment-breaking events.  However, both the definition of segments  and the
              selection of "characteristic" events are not unambiguous.   By analyzing a
              large number of recurrence series and establishing  a set of objective
              selection criteria, the study will quantify  systematically the regularity of
              large earthquakes.  This research  is a component of the National Earthquake
              Hazard Reduction Program.  ***
