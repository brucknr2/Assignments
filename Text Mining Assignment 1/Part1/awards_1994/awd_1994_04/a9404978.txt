Abstract    :
              The conference on Fundamental Problems in Quantum Theory,  will be held at the
              Baltimore campus of the University of  Maryland, June 18-22, 1994.  Issues in
              the foundations of  quantum mechanics are quite timely, and cover a broad range
               of research areas, including interpretations of quantum  mechanics, mesoscopic
              physics, interferometry, geometrical  effects, and quantum optics.
