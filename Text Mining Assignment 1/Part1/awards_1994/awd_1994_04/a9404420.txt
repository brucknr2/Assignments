Abstract    :
              9404420  Wojtkowski           The plan of research includes a number of topics
              in  Hamiltonian dynamical systems relating to billiard dynamics and  their
              geometries. Ergodicity of flows within these systems will  be investigated. The
              research has potential applications to areas  relating to chaotic phenomena
              arising in dynamical systems and  mathematical physics.
