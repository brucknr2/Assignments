Abstract    :
               Under traditional assumptions, estimators converge at root n rates and have
              asymptotic normal distributions when suitably standardized. The project will
              study problems where such asymptotics fail, or where the traditional
              smoothness-based methods of analysis are unable to handle unusual features of
              particular problems. Work has already begun on examples where the failure is
              due to a near lack of identifiability, or to the effects of boundaries of
              parameter spaces, or to the effects of infinite dimensional nuisance
              parameters. Mixture problems, in which all these difficulties arise naturally,
              will be the motivating examples against which the new methods will be tested. 
              The project will concentrate on asymptotic problems in statistics and
              econometrics where the standard methods fail. The PI has long been involved in
              the development of probability tools in the area known as empirical process
              theory--an area that cuts across the fields of statistics, econometrics, and
              computer science. The main aim of the project is to adapt those tools, and
              invent new methods, to apply to currently intractable asymptotic problems.
