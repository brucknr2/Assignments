Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  David Dandy  CTS-9404556    Particle separation in liquid-solids
              laminar flow branches pipes will be investigated using a combined computational
              and experimental fluid mechanics approach.  Three-dimensional Navier Stokes
              simulations will be used to determine particle trajectories and concentrations
              in branched separations including concentration variation with the pipe radius
              (termed tubular pinch) and the effect of secondary currents.  The results will
              be compared to a systematic set of measurements performed by changing the
              particle density, size and shape, and branched pipe diameter ratio and angle. 
              Particles to be used in experiments are of spherical, quasi-spherical and
              elongated shapes, which are relevant to cell separation processes.  The model
              for the velocity and concentration prediction at moderate Reynolds number will
              be used to develop improved design methods.  By concentrating the particles
              away from  the wall, the particle-free fluid can be sucked into side branches. 
                If successful, the project is expected to provide experimental and numerical
              data in a biotechnology area with limited previous research results, and a
              design methodology for two-phase flow in branched pipe systems leading to more
              efficient cell separation systems.  ***
