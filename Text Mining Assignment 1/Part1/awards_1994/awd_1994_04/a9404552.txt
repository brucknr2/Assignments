Abstract    :
              9404552  Castner    Technical abstract:  This Small Grants for Exploratory
              Research  project is devoted to the development of a helical resonator (HR) 
              electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrometer.  The key component of  the
              spectrometer is the high Q (quality factor) HR coil, which  employs
              superconducting wire.  In contrast to existing, single-  frequency ESR
              spectrometers, the HR-based spectrometer will have a  coil that resonates at
              several frequencies.  The successful  development of such a spectrometer would
              have a number of immediate  scientific applications, but in the longer run
              might also lead to  easily transportable commercial spectrometers with
              applications to  a range of fields encompassing physics, chemistry, geology and
               biology.    Non-technical abstract:  Same  ***
