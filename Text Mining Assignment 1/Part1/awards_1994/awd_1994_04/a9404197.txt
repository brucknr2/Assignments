Abstract    :
              The statistical mechanics of various dynamical systems is an  important area of
              research which has seen a high concentration of  recent active research. The
              major objective of this research is  to develop estimates for physical dynamics
              where the random walks  contribute microscopically. These random noises will
              behave  differently under different scales, and therefore provide models  for
              various physical phenomena. The estimates to be developed  will help control
              the magnitude of the fluctuation fields  introduced by the random noises at
              different scales. It will also  allow a quantification of the evolution
              behavior under different  scale and a better understanding of chaotic
              structures.  Many models of physical phenomena are being explained by the 
              interaction of particles at the microscopic level. Different  interactions at
              the microscopic level lead to  different  macroscopic structures. The study of
              these models leads to  fundamental progress in material sciences, chemical
              engineering  and biological engineering. This research is a continuation of 
              the study of the random interaction between particles in  statistical
              mechanics.
