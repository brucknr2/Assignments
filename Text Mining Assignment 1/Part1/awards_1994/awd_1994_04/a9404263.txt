Abstract    :
              9404263  Zhu    The research entails topics in the geometry and topology of 
              Riemannian spaces by analyzing bounds on the sectional and Ricci  curvature.
              Problems relating to heat kernel analysis on certain  singular spaces will aslo
              be pursued. The research may have  potential applications to the theory of
              partial differential  equations and mathematical physics.  ***
