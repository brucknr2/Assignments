Abstract    :
                       This project uses discrete mathematics to study database queries
              concerning  searches of nucleic acid sequences that satisfy certain structural
              properties.  The  specific aims are to provide a better understanding of the
              database and genetic issues  pertaining to search problems and to create tools
              for solving the relevant database  management problems.  The proposed work will
              address issues of physical design and  efficiency and the interplay of various
              conditions on the database and genetic  structures involved.  Finally, the
              project will develop an interface that will allow  complex structurally based
              queries to be framed in a graphical manner.  This proposal  is being jointly
              supported by the Database and Expert Systems Program and the  Database
              Activities in the Biological Sciences.
