Abstract    :
              9404278  Kusner       Topics covered in the research include the geometry of
              area  minimizing and mean curvature surfaces from a variational  viewpoint,
              knot theory and the energy of knots in 3 and 4  dimensional manifolds. The
              research has potential applications to  elastodynamics and fluid membranes in
              surface physics and surface  interfacing in materials theory.  ***
