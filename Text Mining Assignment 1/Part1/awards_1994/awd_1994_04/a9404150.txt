Abstract    :
               A common theme to the areas of research described in this proposal is the
              presence of nuisance parameters and the necessity of  removing an estimation
              bias in the parameter of interest, induced by the estimation of the nuisance
              parameters. The reason why the bias must be removed is that it may lead to
              inconsistency in the maximum likelihood estimator of the parameter of interest.
              The projects all use a projective approach to modify the score function for the
              parameter of interest, so that the bias attributable to the estimation of the
              nuisance parameter is reduced. The benefits of reducing bias will transfer to
              more accurate parameter estimates, confidence intervals with better coverage
              rates and test statistics that for small sample sizes have distributions
              "closer" to their asymptotic limiting distributions. We live in an age where
              information, that is data, is abundant. Our statistical understanding of this
              data arises from making accurate models. The large data sets that we have at
              hand show that simple models rarely fit the data well, and so we are led to
              consider more complex models with many unknowns. The proposed research will
              address the practical implementation and interpretative issues involved with
              these rich statistical models involving many variables.
