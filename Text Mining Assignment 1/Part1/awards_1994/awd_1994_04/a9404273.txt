Abstract    :
              Abstract    9404273  Shen    This research focusses on liquid crystalline
              materials. Proposed investigations are in two general areas: studies of
              nonlinear optical effects in liquid crystals and use of novel optical
              techniques to study liquid crystals. The former includes laser-induced dc
              polarization, wave  mixing, stimulated light scattering, laser-induced
              nonlinear dynamics, and so on. The latter emphasizes liquid  crystalline
              properties that cannot be easily probed by other methods. Particular interest
              is on surface and interfacial  properties of liquid crystals. They are of great
              importance to the advance of liquid crystal device technology, because  it is
              often the surface alignment of liquid crystals that determines the bulk liquid
              crystal alignment needed for specific  devices. These studies should also
              enhance our knowledge about liquid crystals and their responses to light which 
              will help in our search for applications of liquid crystals as modern
              technological materials.   %%%  This research focusses on liquid crystalline
              materials. Liquid crystals are extraordinary optical  materials. They have
              found many applications in display, memory, and sensor devices. Their optical
              properties are  easily modified by external perturbations. An ordinary laser
              beam is often strong enough to effect the modification.  Propagation of a laser
              beam in a liquid crystal can yield many unusual, but interesting, optical
              phenomena potentially useful for optoelectronics. Our research is to discover,
              examine, and understand these phenomena. The  results will also allow us to
              devise new methods to probe various important properties of liquid crystals.
