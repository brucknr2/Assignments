Abstract    :
              9404700  BRAZEL       Among the more important dimensions of environmental
              change  is the expansion of deserts.  Although climatic factors are known  to
              contribute to desertification, the dynamics through which  winds,
              precipitation, and evapotranspiration affect the form and  migration of sand
              dunes is not well understood.  This doctoral  dissertation research project
              will model the meteorological  conditions that activate sand dunes in the
              Mojave Desert of  southern California.  Photographic and written accounts of
              will  be compared with climatic records of wind speed and duration, 
              precipitation, and potential evapotranspiration to identify  conditions leading
              to dune mobility.  Using an index of dune  mobility developed in other locales,
              special attention will focus  on the ways that climatic changes as well as
              human activities,  such as increased use of off-road vehicles, affect
              vegetative  cover that tends to stabilize dunes.       This project will
              contribute to new understandings in a  number of ways.  It will advance
              knowledge about desert  climatology and the influence of both climatic and
              anthropogenic  factors on landforms in arid regions.  It will increase 
              understandings of aeolian geomorphology, and it will provide new  insights into
              the possible consequences of climatic change on the  form and character of
              deserts.  As a doctoral dissertation  improvement award, this award also will
              provide support to enable  a promising student to establish a strong
              independent research  career.
