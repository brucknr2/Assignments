Abstract    :
              ATM-9404776  Dwoskin  This award is for the United States subscription payment
              to  the Scientific Committee on Solar-Terrestrial Research  (SCOSTEP) on the
              International Council of Scientific Unions  (ICSU) for the years 1992 through
              1998.  The SCOSTEP is a  scientific committee of ICSU.  The Board on
              Atmospheric  Sciences and Climate's (BASC) oversight of SCOSTEP and 
              representation of U. S. interests in that organization are  handled through the
              Committee on Solar-Terrestrial Research  (CSTR).  The BASC/CSTR is supported by
              an inter-agency  agreement in the Committee on Earth and Environmental 
              Science/Submcommittee on Atmospheric Research (CEES/SAR) for  this and other
              interests in solar-terrestrial research.  Among  the many services to the U. S.
              science community, SCOSTEP  assists the World Data Centers in defining data
              priorities  relevant to this field of study.  It works within the ICSU to 
              encourage cross-discipline conferences and research.  In the  1970's it
              conducted the International Magnetospheric Studies  (IMS), in the 1980's the
              Middle Atmosphere Program (MAP), and  now conducts the Solar-Terrestrial Energy
              Program (STEP).  ***
