Abstract    :
              9404672  Wong    Technical abstract:  It is proposed to study the dynamics of 
              interfaces in two different types of condensed matter systems.  The  first is
              the movement of fluid interfaces in random porous media  under applied
              pressure, the second is the metal-electrolyte  interface in electrolytic cells
              under applied voltage.  X-ray and  neutron scattering will be used to study the
              physics at microscopic  length scales while video and x-ray imaging will be
              used to probe  the macroscopic behavior.  Emphasis is on the study of
              statistical  problems related to pattern formation and the dynamics of pinning 
              as various system parameters are changed.    Non-technical abstract:  The flow
              of water and oil in a reservoir  is controlled by how the oil-water interface
              moves through the  random porous rock.  The performance of a battery and the
              quality  of electroplating depend on how the structure of the metal- 
              electrolyte interface changes during the electrochemical reactions.   Recent
              research shows that there is much similarity in the physics  that govern these
              apparently dissimilar systems.  The results will  impact on the technologies in
              the petroleum and chemical  industries.  ***
