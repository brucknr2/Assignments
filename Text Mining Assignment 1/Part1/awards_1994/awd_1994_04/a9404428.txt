Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program in the  
              Chemistry Division, Wang will investigate the physical and chemical  
              properties of various metal-containing clusters prepared by laser   evaporation
              from a supersonic cluster beam.  This study will be done   using a
              photoelectron spectrometer which Wang is developing which   emphasizes high
              mass and high energy resolution, allowing him to study   larger sized
              metal-containing clusters and negative ions than have been   examined to date
              with high spectroscopic resolution.  Four types of   systems will be examined: 
              the metal/nonmetal transition in atomic   clusters of Be, Mg, and Zn,
              chemisorbed clusters on transition metal   clusters, bimetallic clusters, and
              endohedral fullerenes.  %%%  Clusters containing up to several hundred atoms
              can be viewed as   microscopic models for surfaces and catalysts, and their
              study will   provide major insights into the macroscopic systems.  It will also
                stimulate theoretical models with which one can predict chemical and  
              catalytic properties of different species.
