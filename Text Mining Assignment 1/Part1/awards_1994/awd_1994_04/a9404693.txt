Abstract    :
              9404693  Langdon    This award supports the foreign travel expenses  for
              Professor Terence G. Langdon, Department of  Materials Science and Engineering
              at the  University of Southern California, to  enable him to make two visits,
              each of three  months duration, in 1994 and 1995, to conduct  collaborative
              research with Professor Minoru  Nemoto of the Kyoto University Faculty of 
              Engineering. The research program is designed  to focus on the role of
              interface phenomena in  determining the type and extent  of polycrystalline
              plasticity at elevated  temperatures.    Two areas have been identified for the
              initial  stages of this research. Work will be conducted  on the importance of
              grain boundaries in the  deformation of metallic alloys with very small  grain
              sizes. These materials have superplastic  capabilities, but the precise roles
              of the  interfaces are not yet understood. The  researchers will also
              investigate the nature  and significance of the interfaces in metallic 
              composites between there inforcement and the  matrix using an aluminum-based
              alloy. This  collaborative effort combines the mechanical  testing expertise of
              Dr. Langdon and his  colleagues at USC with high resolution  electron
              microscopy work at Kyoto University  where Dr. Nemoto serves as the Director of
              the  High Voltage Electron Microscope Laboratory.  The research will expose
              both teams of  investigators to new and important areas and  therefore will
              serve to strengthen  the research activity in both locations.    The award is
              funded under the auspices of the  Center for Global Partnership (CGP) of the 
              Japan Foundation under the NSF-CGP Science  Fellowship Program.  ***
