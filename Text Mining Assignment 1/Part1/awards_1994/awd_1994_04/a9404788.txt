Abstract    :
              This research aims at the accurate numerical constructions  of the full 3+1
              dimensional black hole spacetimes.  Instead  of the traditional approach of
              using special time slicings  to avoid the singularities inherent in black hole 
              spacetimes, a new approach using black hole horizons as  inner boundaries in
              numerical evolution is being developed  in full 3-D numerical relativity.  Such
              a horizon boundary  scheme is expected to have major impact on the numerical 
              study of black holes.  The theme of the research is on the numerical study of
              black  hole spacetimes.  Since the LIGO/VIRGO arrays are expected  to begin
              taking data during this decade, it is important to  perform accurate
              calculations for the shape and strength of  the wave forms generated during
              collisions of black holes,  as such events are considered to be one of the most
               interesting sources of detectable gravitational radiation.
