Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry   Division,
              Prof. D. Neumark of the University of California at Berkeley   will study the
              photodissociation and reaction dynamics of negative ions   in real time. A
              negative ion AB- is excited to a dissociative electronic   state by a
              femtosecond laser pulse. A second femtosecond laser pulse,   time delayed with
              respect to the first, causes photodetachment of the   dissociating ion and the
              resulting photoelectron spectrum is recorded.    This procedure the permits
              observation of the decay of the initially   excited species, the determination
              of the appearance times of the various   anion products, and the measurement of
              their internal energy   distribution.  The polyatomic anions O3-, CO3- and I3-
              will be   investigated.  Also studied will be  cluster anions involving these  
              monomer anion units.    Although negative ions play important roleq in
              atmospheric and solution   phase chemistry, the details of the
              photodissociation and reaction   dynamics are poorly understood.  The goal of
              this research is to obtain a   better understanding of these processes by using
              state-of-the-art   ultrafast laser techniques to track the time evolution of
              the   dissociation or reaction of a negative ion.
