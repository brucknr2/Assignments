Abstract    :
              9404280  Swiatek       The research entails parameter dependence in families of
              one  dimensional mappings including endomorphisms of the circle and  unimodal
              transformations of the interval. Higher dimensional  generalizations are
              expected. This research has a relationship  with hyperbolic dynamical systems
              and has potential applications  to physics and biology.  ***
