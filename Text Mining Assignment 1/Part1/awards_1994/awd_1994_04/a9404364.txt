Abstract    :
              The research project will include theoretical investigation  of delta degrees of
              freedom in trinuclei as probed by the  electromagnetic interaction.  Emphasis
              will be on the effect  of delta degrees of freedom for electromagnetic
              processes at  intermediate energies in order to provide reliable  theoretical
              estimates and analysis for several proposed  electron scattering experiments to
              be carried out at the  Bates-MIT Electron Linear Accelerator Center and the 
              Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility.
