Abstract    :
              This project deals with the properties and applications of balanced  codes.  In
              a balanced code, each code word contains equal number of  1's and O's.  These
              codes find many applications in computer and  communication systems such as
              noise reduction in VLSI systems,  fault masking in bus lines of VLSI systems,
              delay insensitive  communications in asynchronous systems, data transmission in
              fiber  optics, data storage in optical discs and magnetic tapes, and fault 
              tolerant synchronous circuits.  The objective of this research is  to develop
              design methods for balanced codes suitable to these  applications.  Our aim is
              to design codes which require low  redundancy but at the same time have fast
              and simple  encoding/decoding algorithms.  Other topics such as error 
              correcting balanced codes, asymmetric error correcting and  detecting codes
              applicable to the above mentioned applications will  also be investigated.
