Abstract    :
                9404026  Redding  This is an individual Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
              Plant Biology award.  The Fellow received his Ph.D. from Stanford University. 
              His Ph.D. thesis research was in the area of yeast cell biology.  He will carry
              out his postdoctoral fellowship research in the laboratory of Dr. Jean-David
              Rochaix at University of Geneva in Switzerland.  The proposed research is
              entitled "Generation and characterization of photosystem I mutants impaired in
              energy transfer and electron transport".  The postdoctoral experience will
              expand his scientific expertise to plant biology and will contribute to his
              growth as a member of the world-wide plant biology community.
