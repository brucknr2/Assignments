Abstract    :
              9404704  Meier  The focus of this research is the preparation and 
              characterization of reduced fullerenes, particularly those  formed from the
              Birch reduction of C60.  The chemical  reactivity of these compopunds will be
              compared to that of the  parent system.  Substitution wih hydrogen atoms, alkyl
              groups,  electron donating functional groups and electron withdrawing  groups
              will all be used to modify the properties of the  fullerenes.  %%%  With this
              award, the Synthetic Organic Program supports the  research of Dr. Mark S.
              Meier of the Department of Chemistry of  the University of Kentucky.  
              Professor Meier will focus his  work on the investigation of the chemical
              behavior of the class  of compounds known as reduced fullerenes.  These
              compounds have  potential as materials having tailored electronic and optical 
              properties.
