Abstract    :
              9404644  Savits       The Statistics Group with in the Department of 
              Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Pittsburgh  will purchase
              computer equipment which will be dedicated to  the support of research in the
              mathematical sciences.  The  equipment will be used fir several research
              projects,  including in particular the research of:  1.)  H. Block and  A.
              Sampson on isotonic regression and degradation processes;  2.)  H. Block and T.
              Savits on reliability and burn-in;  3.)  D. Stoffer on categorical time series;
               4.)  S. Iyengar and  T. Savits on applied stochastic modelling;  and  5.)  M. 
              Brimacombe and L. Gleser on nonlinear inference.
