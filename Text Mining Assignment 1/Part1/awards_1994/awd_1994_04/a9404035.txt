Abstract    :
                9404035  Krysan  This is an individual award for the Postdoctoral Research
              Fellowship in Plant Biology.  The applicant received his Ph.D. from Stanford
              University.  His Ph.D. research was to investigate the origin of replication in
              human chromosomes.  He now plans to change his field of research and carry out
              his postdoctoral fellowship research in the laboratory of Dr. Michael Sussman
              at University of Wisconsin.  The proposed research entitled "Homologous
              recombination in Arabidopsis" will expand the scientific experience of this
              Fellow into plant biology and make use of his background in the mechanisms of
              chromosomal replication in Eukaryotic organisms.
