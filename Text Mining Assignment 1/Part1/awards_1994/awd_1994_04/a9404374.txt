Abstract    :
              9404374  Muraki        The theme of proposed work centers on the evolution of 
              spatial structure in nonlinear models which derive from physical  systems of
              current interest: a) self-focussing of light in  nematic liquid crystals, b)
              interfacial pattern formation in  chemical reactions, c) flow structures in
              complex fluids. In  particular, the mathematical objective is to establish 
              relationships between coherent structures, instability and  dynamics as
              pertains to the development of weakly-turbulent  behaviors in simple nonlinear
              systems. The basic strategy  involves both the identification of the primary
              structural modes,  and the determination of their dynamics and interaction 
              properties. A combination of asymptotic analysis, dynamical  systems methods
              and numerical computation are employed to obtain  clear illustrations of the
              mechanisms by which spatial structures  are created and sustained by
              nonlinearity. This, in turn,  provides an analytical basis leading to a
              physical understanding  for the underlying nonlinear phenomena.     A familiar
              example of  a spatio-temporal evolution is the video record of satellite 
              weather maps as often shown on the evening news. While the  imagery of spatial
              features that evolve over time is a common  theme for many physical and
              biological phenomena, our  quantitative understanding of these processes is
              actually quite  limited. The proposed research investigates the model equations
               for unusually complex patterns -- the break-up of optical laser  beams, and
              the spreading of chemicals in surface reactions --  which have only recently
              been produced in the laboratory, but  hold future promise for the design and
              control of new fine-scale  processes.
