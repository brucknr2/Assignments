Abstract    :
              9404154  Chang        The proposed research lies in the area of differential
              geometry, in particular,  submanfiolds and harmonic maps. Five problems are
              proposed: classify isoparametric   hypersurfaces in higher dimensional spheres
              with four distinct principal curvatures;  find closed Riemannain n-manifolds of
              constant scalar curvature admitting isometric  minimal immersions into the
              (n+1)-dimensional sphere; the third and fourth problems  are about the
              uniqueness of minimal embedded tori in the 3-sphere and Euclidean 3-  space
              respectively; the last problem is to classify those submanifolds of complex 
              projective space whose normal bundles come with Hermitian-Einstein metrics.    
                 The problems considered have a classical origin; in particular, the study of
               minimal surfaces has an interesting history and remains an active area of
              research in  mathematics.  ***
