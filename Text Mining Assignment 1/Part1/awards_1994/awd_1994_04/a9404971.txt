Abstract    :
              9404971  Kostic  Iowa State Univ.  Dr. Nenad Kostic, Chemistry Department, Iowa
              State University, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and
              Organometallic Chemistry Program for the development of Pd(II) complexes as new
              inorganic chemical reagents for selective cleavage of proteins. Kostic has
              discovered that regioselective hydrolysis of peptides and proteins is promoted
              by Pt(II) and Pd(II) complexes. In this project the mechanism of this cleavage
              will be studied and the role of the metal ion analyzed. The information
              obtained in these studies will be used to increase the selectivity of the
              cleavage reactions and to design reagents which will perform the cleavage
              catalytically.   Selective cleavage of large proteins into well defined smaller
              parts is important in analytical biochemistry and biotechnology. In current
              practice a group of enzymes known as proteases are used to perform this
              operation. However, the proteases do not cleave folded proteins and they
              generate many relatively short pieces of the protein, whereas large segments
              are often desired. This research is aimed at overcoming these problems with a
              new type of reagent based on the metals, platinum and palladium. Already this
              project has shown promise in biopharmaceutical research, where the selective
              cleavage of a protein has led to a potential commercial product.
