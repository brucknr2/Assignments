Abstract    :
              9404786  Hudak  This project is in the area of programming language design and 
              implementation. The project will develop new methodologies and  tools for the
              design and implementation of domain specific  languages (DSL). The project will
              apply the following ideas to  the embedded language design.    Extensible
              Language Design. Since a large portion of every  language design effort is
              concerned with the design of the  syntax, and other minor issues such as
              conditional statements,  boolean and arithmetic operators, the project will
              investigate  the use of generic  syntax for the design of DSL's. The idea is 
              to extend the generic syntax in a modular fashion to meet the  needs of
              specific domains.    Rapid DSL Realization Using Partial Evaluation. In order
              to  develop DSL compilers quickly, the project will explore the use  of partial
              evaluations.  Although the resulting compilers will be  less efficient than
              hand-crafted compilers, they will be  constructed quickly and automatically,
              and they are provably  correct with respect to the interpreter specifications. 
                First-Class Tools. The project will apply the methodologies  developed by the
              PI for specifying language tools such as  debuggers and profilers, to the
              development of tools for DSL.  ***
