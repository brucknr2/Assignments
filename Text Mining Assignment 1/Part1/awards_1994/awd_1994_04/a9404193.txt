Abstract    :
              This project, supported by the NSF Theoretical and Computational Chemistry
              Program, develops  computational methods for the study of Born Oppenheimer
              breakdown in excited electronic  states, and their application to the study of
              photochemical pathways.  Methods using analytic  energy derivatives for
              multiconfiguration self-consistent field (MCSCF) wavefunctions are  employed to
              locate low energy surface crossings and avoided crossings.  The theory is
              applied  to the study of spin-forbidden, non-adiabatic processes relevant to
              gas lasers and atmospheric  chemistry such as photodissociation of ozone, at
              wavelengths below 310 nm, to produce both  singlet and triplet products.    The
              central goal of this research is the development of the quantum mechanical
              theory of  elementary chemical reactions of molecules in electronically excited
              states, usually resulting from  the absorption of light of an appropriate
              frequency.  An important feature of these photochemical  reactions is the fact
              that these excited molecules can jump from one electronic state to another 
              with a concomitant transfer of energy between electronic, vibrational, and
              translational degrees  of freedom.  This theoretical research project provides
              deeper insight into such molecular  processes revealed by spectroscopic and
              kinetic experiments.  This project develops basic  theoretical tools widely
              applicable to photochemical processes, in particular, to computer models  of
              ozone depletion in the atmosphere.
