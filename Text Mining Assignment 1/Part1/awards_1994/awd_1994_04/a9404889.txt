Abstract    :
              Funds are provided to construct novel, light-based  microscopes with a
              resolution which is not limited by the  wavelength of light and which are
              sensitive to both the  local dielectric constant and the local Raman spectrum.
              The  instrument exploits the properties of plasmons (resonant  oscillations of
              the electrons in a metal) to enhance the  local electric field of a plane,
              line, or point-like  metallic structure to a level far above that of the
              applied  light field. The enhancement of the field heightens the  radiated
              Raman intensity through the well-known surface-  enhanced Raman scattering
              effect. An image is formed by  scanning a probe; the probe is either: i) a
              point-like  structure which results in surface plasmon radiated light or  ii) a
              small dipole plasmon resonator (e.g. a silver sphere).  The instrument has a
              wide range of applications for  examining: 1) nanostructured materials, 2)
              patterns in  integrated circuits, and 3) three dimensional imaging of the 
              internal structure of a biological or other soft samples  which are robust
              enough to survive "piercing" by a probe. In  all cases, the contrast of the
              images will be controlled by  the local dielectric constant and Raman spectrum.
              Thus,  information on the location, structure and chemical nature  of the
              materials can be identified and mapped. The  development of this project will
              involve the participation  of students and postdoctoral fellows. It is
              anticipated that  the microscope eventually will be licensed to companies for 
              marketinq and sales.
