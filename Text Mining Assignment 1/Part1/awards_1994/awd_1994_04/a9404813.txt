Abstract    :
                    ABSTRACT    P.I. Alan Walker  SBR-9404813    Alan Walker and Meave Leakey,
              two very well known and widely  respected paleoanthropologists, will excavate a
              most  promising early hominid site at Lake Turkana, Kenya, in this  project. 
              This site has already yielded a few scattered  hominid reamins from superficial
              surface collections, and  the time period represented in this site currently 
              represents a gap in our knowledge of human evolution.  The  earliest known
              hominid fossils date back to 3.6 million  years. and these deposits date to 4
              million years, getting  close to the hypothesized time of splitting of the ape
              and  human lineages.  ***
