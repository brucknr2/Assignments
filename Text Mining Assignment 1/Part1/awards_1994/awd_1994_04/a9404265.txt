Abstract    :
              9404265  Ablowitz      This project involves the study of solutions to a class
              of  physically significant nonlinear wave equations. New reductions  of the
              self dual Yang-Mills system will be considered. The self  dual equations have
              been shown to be a master integrable system  from which virtually all known
              soliton equations are contained as  special cases. Novel classes of solutions
              will be studied  including those recently found which can be expressed in terms
              of  classical automorphic functions whose solution structure possess  complex
              singularities which are natural boundaries in the complex  plane. Nonlinear
              integrable systems will be used in computational  simulations in order to
              establish the existence of and to  analytically understand the phenomena of
              numerical chaos. New  solutions to physically important forced nonlinear wave
              equations  will be developed.   Many of the nonlinear equations we are 
              studying are universally important asymptotic approximations in  physical
              phenomena. Applications include nonlinear optical wave  propagation, internal
              and surface waves in fluid dynamics,  lattice dynamics, and relativity. The use
              of solitons in the  technological application of long distance communication
              has been  widely noted. In this research project, multisoliton solutions  and
              their interaction properties will be analyzed in order to  significantly
              improve the effectiveness of soliton based  communication systems. This is
              usually referred to as wave length  division multiplexing (WDM) in optical
              communications. One of the  forced nonlinear wave systems which will be studied
              involves  moving pressure distributions in surface waves, such as ships  moving
              at critical speeds.
