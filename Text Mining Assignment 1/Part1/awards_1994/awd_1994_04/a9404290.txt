Abstract    :
              9404290  Dodd  Unification of integrable SystemsThe proposal investigates  the
              classification of integrable systems through the  representation theory of
              affine Lie algebras. The proposal  intends to classify equations, integrable
              through the  Kruskal mechanism, by using the representation theory of  level 1
              infinite rank affine Lie algebras. Canonical  representations of the classical
              finite rank affine Lie  algebras, determined by maximal Heisenberg subalgebras,
              can  be associated with reductions of the representations of the  infinite rank
              affine Lie algebras, as can many diverse  integrable systems (pde, ode,
              differential-difference etc.)  which are found by exhaustive construction
              within each  canonical representation.
