Abstract    :
              The project's general aim is to bring the tools and techniques of  modern
              statistics to bear on a variety of problems from genetics  and molecular
              biology. The specific objectives of this project  are (i) to develop a suitable
              statistical model and method of  analysis for determining which of a given set
              of DNA markers come  from the same chromosome, based on data obtained from
              scoring  hybrid cell lines; (ii) to extend and refine statistical methods 
              designed to ascertain overlap of cloned DNA fragments; (iii) to  develop
              accurate statistical methods for recognizing the  resemblance of a new protein
              to a known structure or structural  motif, on the basis of its amino acid
              sequence; (iv) to extend  the theory of linear invariants for use in general
              phylogenetic  inference; (v) to derive statistical models for the evolution of 
              viral genomes; and (vi) to develop a statistical model for the  evolution of
              certain repetitive DNA elements in human  populations.    The aim of this
              project is to develop and use statistical methods  for analysing a variety of
              forms of molecular genetic data.  Included in the scope will be data collected
              on individuals, on  single chromosomes, on small cloned DNA fragments, on amino
              acid  sequences of proteins, and on DNA sequences of genes. Such data 
              invariably exhibits some form of randomness, arising from its  manner of
              collection, the location of the DNA in the genome, and  the evolutionary
              history of the molecules. Statistical methods  are needed to cope with this
              randomness, and to permit inferences  to be made concerning questions such as
              the relative or absolute  location of genetic or other markers on the
              chromosomes, and the  nature of the evolution of the genes or genomes.
