Abstract    :
              Winslow  9404844  The objective of this research is to utilize modern principles
              of nonlinear dynamical system theory in conjunction with the power of massively
              parallel computing to study, in great biophysical detail, the effects of
              ischemia on the dynamics of single cardiac cells and networks.  It will use a
              physiologically detailed model of single cardiac cells which consists of 16
              coupled ordinary differential equations.  Tools for chaos theory will then be
              used to analyze the model.
