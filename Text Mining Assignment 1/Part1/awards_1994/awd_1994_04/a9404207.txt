Abstract    :
              9404207  Loomis       This project will give the proposer the opportunity to 
              study  partial differential equations while visiting at the  University  of
              Houston.  Specifically, the well-posedness,  approximation and  long time
              behavior of systems of equations  whose components are   dependent on nonlinear
              terms will be  investigated.  These systems  arise in a variety of physical and
               biological contexts and present  many challenging questions.   Little work
              concerning functionally dependent reaction diffusion  systems appears in the
              liturature.       The project will address problems arising in the modeling  of
              the historical dependence of the nonlinearity and the  persistence of
              nonnegativity of solution components.  ***
