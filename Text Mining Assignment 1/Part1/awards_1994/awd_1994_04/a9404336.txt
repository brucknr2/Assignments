Abstract    :
              9404336  Hardt      The research is in the general area of geometric variational
               problems and in particular focuses on the study of energy-  minimizing maps of
              Riemannian manifolds. The singularities of  these maps and generalizations to
              higher order energy densities  will be considered. The research has
              applications to liquid  crystals and crystalline structures in materials
              science.  ***
