Abstract    :
              9404852  Russell  The long-term objective of this project is to understand the
              genetic control of the establishment of infection and the in vivo replication
              of yeast double-stranded RNA viruses.   The research will define the important
              cis-acting viral sequences and the trans-acting host yeast genes necessary and
              sufficient for establishing an infection and for in vivo replication of the L-A
              and M1 double-stranded RNA viruses of yeast.  Replicon systems for analyzing
              the molecular details of viral infection and replication will be developed. 
              Properties of successful replicons will be compared with the properties of
              natural L-A and M1 viruses.  The 5' and 3' sequence requirements for and
              sequence context effects on infection replication and translation will be
              identified.  %%%  The research will contribute to our knowledge of the genetics
              and molecular biology of the viral life cycle, and of viral/host interactions
              in yeast.  The genetic tractability of yeast makes it  possible to define
              interactions between host genes and viral functions.  By contrast, in mammalian
              systems, the difficulty of doing genetics makes such detailed studies of
              host-virus interactions very challenging if not impossible.  The knowledge
              obtained in this research may be generalized to other viral systems, including
              those of agricultural and environmental significance; in particular,
              newly-identified yeast genes involved specifically in the virus life cycle will
              facilitate searches for similar genes in other systems.  ***
