Abstract    :
               This project continues work on the development of  XSB system.  XSB is a system
              that integrates logic programming,  deductive  databases and nonmonotonic
              reasoning. It uses SLG  resolution, a tabled  evaluation strategy, to combine
              Prolog's SLD  and deductive databases's bottom  up evaluation in a 
              computationally effective way. Current benchmarks show that  the XSB system is
              significantly faster than more traditional  approaches to  deductive database
              query evaluation, and shows  promise of being very efficient  for certain types
              of nonmonotonic  reasoning.    In the current project, the XSB  implementation
              will be improved  by; (1) improving the underlying WAM-based engine  to make it
              more  efficient, and (2) developing program transformation techniques  to 
              permit XSB programs to be optimized at the source level.
