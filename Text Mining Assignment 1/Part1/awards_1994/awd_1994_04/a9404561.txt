Abstract    :
              9404561  Brandon        The principal investigator plans to study creation and
              propagation of  oscillations on a model for the evolution of phase transitions
              (with a  viscoelastic damping term), by considering solutions generated by a
              convergent  sequence of initial data. Fonseca, Lin, Rogers and the PI intend to
              prove the  convergence of a numerical scheme for solving a nonlocal variational
              problem  modelling one-dimensional mechanical phase transitions. Ma and the PI
              plan to  clarify (numerically first) the full picture for a nonlocal model for 
              ferromagnetic materials with (nonlocal) exchange energies that yield 
              hysteresis. The PI and Rogers are currently examining the stationary points of 
              the James/Kinderlehrer Terfanol model using a symbolic manipulator.        The
              goal of this work is to aid in the technical knowhow for shape  memory alloys.
              The aim of the first project is to help in the attempts to  model the evolution
              of phase transitions in these materials. There are a lot  of problems in
              obtaining numerical data for phase transitions, the hope in the  second project
              is to help in solving some of those problems.(The data already  obtained is
              very promising.) The work with Ma is intended to aid in  constructing models
              that can predict the behaviour of ferromagnetic materials.  Finally, Rogers and
              the PI hope to gain further insight into the  aforementioned model for Terfanol
              and for magnetostrictive materials in  general.
