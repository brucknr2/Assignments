Abstract    :
              This program supports graduate student attendance at the  1994 Gordon Research
              Conference on Multiphoton Processes  held in Colby-Sawyer College in New
              London, New Hampshire.  The conference represents a highly successful merger of
              both  chemists and physicists, expreimentalist and theorists.  The  conference
              has attracted a large number of young  investigators.  Attendance at the
              meeting is valuable to  students and contributes to the vitality of the
              meeting.
