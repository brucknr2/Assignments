Abstract    :
              Schwarz           The award supports research in invariant theory and algebraic
              groups.   The principal investigator will study the structure of differential
              operators on quotient  varieties; study the structure of the modules of
              covariants; and work on part of  Fefferman's program of parabolic invariant
              theory.           The research supported  involves invariant theory and
              algebraic groups.  In general, invariant theory involves the  actions of linear
              algebraic groups on manifolds or linear spaces and the determination of  the
              mathematical invariants of the space under these group actions. ***
