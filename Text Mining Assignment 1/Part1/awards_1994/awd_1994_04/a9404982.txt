Abstract    :
              9404982  Manson       Calculation of the photoionization and impact ionization 
              cross sections of atoms will be performed using a variety of  computational
              techniques.  The aim is to employ the simplest  approach capable of giving
              quantitative accuracy for the process  under consideration.  The studies
              include investigations of  excited state photo processes, inner-shell
              photoionization,  photoionization plus excitation high Z relativistic 
              photoionization and neutral and charged particle impact  ionization.  The
              results of the calculation provide insight into  the basic nature of the
              atomic/electromagnetic field interaction  and are useful for plasma, astro and
              radiological physics  applications.  ***
