Abstract    :
              9404617  Klein  This research proposal centers on two unique types of 
              Precambrian iron-formations in Brazil.  The first is the  iron and manganese
              region of Urucum which is of  Late  Proterozoic age.  The second, of Archean
              age, is in the  Serra dos Carajas region of Brazil and is considered the 
              largest Archean deposit of high-grade iron ore in the world.  These two
              iron-formations have been selected for detailed  geologic, petrologic and
              geochemical studies (major  elements, REE, total organic carbon, and C and S
              isotopics  where appropriate).  This is in full cooperation with  Professor
              Eduardo A. Ladeira of the Federal University of  Minas Gerais in Belo Horizonte
              and several of the Brazilian  mining companies.  Results from these studies
              will allow for  better constraints in global geochemical models of evolution 
              of the ocean and atmosphere in Precambrian time.
