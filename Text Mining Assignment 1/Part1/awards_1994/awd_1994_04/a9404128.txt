Abstract    :
              9404128  Mordukhovich/Ioffe       This project is concerned with developing
              effective methods  of infinite dimensional nonsmooth analysis and their
              applications  to various problems in optimization and control theory. The main 
              focus is on basic tools and calculus for generalized  differentiation of
              nonsmooth mappings in Banach spaces,  differential characterizations of
              openness, regularity, and  related properties of infinite dimensional
              multifunctions, as  well as on a broad spectrum of applications of nonsmooth
              analysis  to optimal control of differential equations and inclusions, 
              distributed parameter systems, and stability and sensitivity  questions in
              constrained optimization and control theory.       Nonsmooth analysis is
              concerned with the development of a  calculus suitable for the analysis of
              functions which do not have  the necessary smoothness properties that allow
              application of the  standard calculus of variations. This investigation is
              largely  motivated by important applications of nonsmooth calculus and 
              variational analysis to problems arising in optimization and  control of
              manufacturing systems. In particular, this work is  related to minimax design
              of dynamical systems under uncertain  conditions, stability of optimal
              solutions under parameter  perturbations, and robust control of constrained
              distributed  parameter systems.  ***
