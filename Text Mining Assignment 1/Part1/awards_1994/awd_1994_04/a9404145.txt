Abstract    :
              9404145  Barge      The research covers studies of rotational behavior for 
              invariant irreducible plane continua using methods of topological  dynamics.
              Minimal sets of Denjoy type and periodic orbits will  also be investigated. The
              research has potential applications to  other areas of dynamical systems and
              chaos theory.  ***
