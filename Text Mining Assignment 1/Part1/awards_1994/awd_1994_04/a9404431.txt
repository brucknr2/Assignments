Abstract    :
              9404431  Hager/Dontchev       This research will pursue the applications of
              recent  implicit function-type results for set-valued maps in an infinite 
              dimensional setting to numerical algorithms for optimal control  problems and
              the Lipschitz properties of their solutions.  This work considers control
              problems with state and control  constraints for which there are many open
              questions. Log-barrier  approaches to control constraints will be investigated,
              and error  estimates for discretizations will be derived.       This research
              will develop and analyze numerical algorithms  for solving optimal control
              problems with control and state  constraints. In particular, the possible
              Lipschitz properties of  optimal solutions will be investigated. Knowledge of
              the  Lipschitz continuity of the solution is important, for instance,  in the
              study of the convergence behavior of various numerical  approximations for the
              solution. Anticipated applications of the  research include problems in
              computer aided geometric design, and  optimal motion planning of a flexible
              structure (such as a robot  or a crane) in the presence of obstacles.
