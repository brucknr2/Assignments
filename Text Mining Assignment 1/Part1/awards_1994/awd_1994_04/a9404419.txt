Abstract    :
              9404419  Rychlik       The research entails topics in the dynamics of
              billiard-type  systems and estimates of the spectrum of the Laplacian in convex
               domains. Another component of the research involves the geometry  of Lorentz
              attractors and homoclinic orbits. This research  figures prominently in
              dynamical systems and has potential  applications to other areas of mathematics
              and topics in  mathematical physics.  ***
