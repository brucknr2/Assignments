Abstract    :
              The goal of the proposed project is to provide skilled employees  for the
              biotechnology industry.  To achieve this goal, a  collaboration will be
              established between the Biotechnology  Laboratory Technician Program at Madison
              Area Technical College,  the University of Wisconsin Teacher Enhancement
              Program, and the  industry-based BioPharmaceutical Technology Center Institute.
               This  proposal, An Advanced Biotechnology Education Partnership Program,  is a
              well-coordinated, highly integrated effort to:  (1) develop  and disseminate
              curriculum materials specifically designed for  technician training at the
              two-year associate degree level; (2)   provide teacher enhancement activities
              in biotechnology including  summer institutes, mentoring and curriculum
              development  partnerships for associate degree and secondary level school 
              teachers; and, (3) support the development and coordination of  industry-led,
              statewide programs to offer work-based experiences  for high school students. 
              The proposed program will thus link  together the development of instructional
              materials with faculty  enhancement, student laboratory experiences and
              school-to-work  initiatives.
