Abstract    :
              9454822  Bossert    The Hawaii Education and Research Network (HERN) requests $4
              million over three years for  the statewide deployment of networking
              infrastructure to support all public education in Hawaii.   It does so through
              the strength of an existing partnership: the Hawaii Educational Networking 
              Consortium.  Founding members of the Consortium are:              Hawaii State
              Department of Education (DOE), which provides all K-12, adult,            and
              community-based learning services;            University of Hawaii system (UH),
              which provides all public higher education            programs including
              community colleges and research institutes, and;            East-West Center
              (EWC), a Federally sponsored non-profit research and graduate           
              education institute.    The Consortium's purpose is to develop and promote the
              use of telecommunications technology  in education and research in Hawaii.  It
              represents all public education and research in Hawaii,  and has a proven track
              record in collaborative applications of information technology including 
              distance education, site licensing, and the deployment of the Internet.    The
              technical networking infrastructure proposed includes the expansion of Internet
              access to  every public school and campus in Hawaii, largely through existing
              resources and a unique  partnership with the cable companies mandated through
              Hawaii's regulatory environment.  The  infrastructure also includes a
              distributed statewide Internet server architecture, a statewide  Network
              Information Center and a Network Operations Center, to be managed by the
              University  of Hawaii, and a training program for teachers in the middle and
              high schools.    The goal of deploying this network is to support educational
              reform.  In the middle and high  schools, we will use the network to reform the
              school day.  By building on the existing School  Community Based Management
              program, schools will have the option and opportunity to move  from a
              traditional class based schedule to a tea m oriented, multidisciplinary project
              based  program.  In higher education, the State's community colleges will use
              the network to  collaboratively develop a network-based curriculum in
              pre-engineering that will be delivered  statewide to students who have
              previously had no access to such courses.  In both cases, the  network
              infrastructure will facilitate ongoing visions and programs within the DOE and
              UH.   By building on ongoing programs and the existing infrastructure there is
              a significant  cost-sharing component by the proposers.    In the course of
              Project HERN we will address the following types of research questions:        
                   What types of organizational and management structures best support the   
                      deployment and operation of a statewide educational network?           
              What technological and management issues will be faced in knitting together    
                     Ethernet-over-CATV networks provided by cable TV companies throughout
              the            state?            What set of network interfaces and filters
              will support appropriate educational            access to the Internet at all
              levels across an entire state?            How can effective training be
              provided to an educational community numbering            in the hundreds of
              thousands?            How can collaborative curriculum development and delivery
              be supported over            the Internet?
