Abstract    :
              Project Monterey Advanced Technology Education (MATE) is uniting  educational
              institutions (grades 9-16-university) and cooperating  science-related agencies
              in a consortium to design a marine,  environmental, and global change ATE
              Center at Monterey Bay, CA.   The goal of providing better educated science and
              engineering  technicians is made possible through the proposed alliance of
              local  institutions and scientific agencies that surround Monterey Bay.   These
              human and technological resources, aligned with the unique  bioresources of
              Monterey Bay, provide for the development of an  articulated, technologically
              enhanced and thematic environmental  science education program  including
              curriculum, instructional  strategies, and products serving as a model for
              replication and  national dissemination.  Project MATE is providing for a
              program  formulation session in order to identify courses, products, 
              technology, and resources to be merged, aligned, designed, and  developed for
              the planned ATE Center.  MATE is producing a  blueprint for systemic change
              relative to the new articulated  curriculum and instruction utilizing the
              resources of the  environment, scientific, industrial and business communities
              of the  Monterey Bay area.  This project is planning to implement a  nationwide
              model for a technologically enhanced and articulated  marine, environmental and
              global change science instructional  program that will produce science and
              engineering professionals.
