Abstract    :
                We propose to develop graduate training of doctoral-level students  in
              specific areas of Geosciences and Environmental Physical  Sciences through the
              NSF Graduate Research Traineeship Program.   These Traineeships will be
              implemented through the joint  arrangement that exist between the Earth System
              Science Program and  the Department of Chemistry.  In particular, we propose to
              pursue  graduate research training in five area: 1) coastal oceanography,  2)
              ocean-atmosphere interactions, 3)hydrology, 4) development of  state-of-the-art
              instrumental techniques, and 5) modeling of  atmospheric chemistry using
              high-performance computing methods.    Innovative aspects of the Program
              include 1) recruitment of  underrepresented graduate students using a variety
              of activities  including the pipeline established at UCI through the CAMP 
              (California Alliance for Minority Participation) Program, 2)  participation of
              trainees in a monthly research seminar series, 3)  participation of trainees in
              field studies during their first two  years in graduate school, 4) completion
              by trainees of a teaching  assistant training program, 5) establishment of a
              Traineeship  Oversight Committee who will be responsible for choosing the GRTs,
               and for appointment of a specialized committee to advise each  trainee. 
              Graduate Research Traineeships will substantially  increase the resources
              needed to help achieve our goal of graduate  education and research in the
              fields within Geosciences.
