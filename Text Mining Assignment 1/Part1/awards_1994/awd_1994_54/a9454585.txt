Abstract    :
              9454585  Newberry  The Kentucky Community College System is establishing
              computer  facilities at each of its fifteen widely separated community  college
              campuses.  These new facilities are being utilized for  statewide reform of the
              mathematics algebra-level and calculus  which form part of the curriculum for
              students in advanced  technology programs. The labs will also support
              development of new  two-year curricula in telecommunications and computer
              system  management. A system of formal courses (taught using satellite 
              facilities) to train faculty and staff to maintain the network  system are
              catalyzing Continuing Education/Community Service  programs in the use and
              administration of network systems and will  develop the capability to offer a
              new associate degree program in  network system administration. At the
              conclusion of this project  approximately 40% of the System's intermediate and
              college algebra  level mathematics courses will be taught as integrated courses
              in  a collaborative learning environment using technology as a learning  tool.
              While 15,000 students across Kentucky will directly benefit  from the revised
              curriculum during the actual project period, the  project will ultimately
              affect many thousands more students and  ordinary citizens.
