Abstract    :
              Henry Ford Community College is revising the curriculum of its  introductory
              Technical Physics course, a class required for  students in career education
              programs such as electrical  /electronics technology, energy technology,
              industrial drafting,  manufacturing engineering, and robotics.  With
              approximately 200  students enrolled in PHYS 120 each year, the College has a 
              significant population for its study.The revised course  incorporates Workshop
              Physics, technological applications, and  writing across the curriculum, and in
              the process is being aligned  with the National Science Education Standards as
              articulated in the  July '93 Progress Report (NCSESA 1993).  Working closely
              with a  steering committee comprised primarily of industry representatives, 
              the HFCC project team is determining current technological  applications that
              require physics that is included in the  introductory course.  Industry is also
              contributing to the design  of the writing component of the technical physics
              course, providing  samples of technical reports appropriate in the industrial
              context.
