Abstract    :
              9454615  Bishara  The Virginia State Grant Consortium (VSGC), in collaboration
              with  the Virginia Community College System (VCCS), 23 community  colleges, 3
              Space Grant universities, the State Department of  Education, and a broad
              spectrum of business and industry interests,  is planning for the development
              of an Advanced Technological  Education Center (TechQuest) for the Commonwealth
              of Virginia to  address the needs of advanced technological education.  Through
              the  TechQuest Planning Initiative, the Virginia Space Grant Consortium  and
              its partners is evaluating existing curricula at the community  colleges,
              planning appropriate revision and augmentation of  curricula, and developing
              professional enhancement activities for  community college faculty, secondary
              teachers and guidance  counselors to support this curricular reform for
              advanced  technological education. Commitment to the TechQuest initiative of 
              the VSGC, VCCS administration, higher education, industry, and  other partners
              is very strong. The planning phase for the TechQuest  Center is being led by
              project director (Michael N. Bishara,  D.Sc. Southwest Community College),
              project manager (Mary Sandy,  Director, VSGC), a steering committee, a team of
              technical,  academic and resource advisors, and planning teams for four 
              advanced technology strands.  These content strands include: core-  courses,
              high performance manufacturing, electronics and  environmental technology.  The
              goal of the planning phase is to  develop an action plan for the implementation
              of the TechQuest  Center through which extensive curriculum reform will be
              instituted  in Virginia's community colleges along with the proposing 
              professional development strategies to support the renovated  curriculum for
              advanced technological education.
