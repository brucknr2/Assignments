Abstract    :
              9454825  Heeter    The Digital Learning Center for Microbial Ecology will bring
              together scientists, educators and  multimedia designers to develop
              interactive, computer-based active learning tools that motivate  learners to
              explore, discover, manipulate and interact with the microscopic world of
              organisms  that exist throughout our environment.  Our intent is to spark an
              awareness of microbes in nature  for K-12 science education and to provide
              teachers and students with credible and effective  learning tools which focus
              on themes pursued by the Center for Microbial Ecology which have  broad public
              interest, including biodegradation, microbial evolution and biodiversity.
              Microbes  have traditionally been portrayed in their role as disease-causing
              "germs," but they also play  many beneficial roles as essential agents in food
              production, waste disposal, and other processes  critical to the continuation
              of life on Earth.    The Digital Learning Center will be accessible to K-12
              teachers and students over the Internet  and on CD-ROM, taking advantage of the
              ease of transporting large interactive multimedia  content with elegant user
              interfaces via CD-ROM and the ease of updatable text and multimedia 
              information access and electronic mail communication available over the
              Internet.  Components  of the Center will include:    The Microbe Zoo - an
              ever-growing collection of microbes on digital video on photos which can  be
              explored through a multimedia "zoo ' interface or searched and sorted as a
              multimedia  database which links text, data, images and digital video;   
              Interactive Learning Experiences - multimedia interactive software modules that
              provide teachers  with learning experiences that can engage students with
              various aspects of the science of  microbial ecology;    Meet the Scientists -
              digital video clips of center scientists explaining in lay terms their research
               and aspects of science they find fascinating, plus a moderated bulletin board
              for communication  among students, teachers and  scientists;    Microbes In The
              News - digitized print and electronic stories in the news, combined with 
              commentary from scientists and topical lessons plans for teaching about science
              in contexts that  relates to students' lives;    Digital Teaching Assistant  -
              suggestions and electronic lesson plans for using the Digital  Learning Center
              for teaching and learning;    Hands-On Laboratory Resources - lesson plans for
              teachers on conducting real world  experiments where students experience
              kinesthetic, olefactory and real time process of scientific  inquiry in their
              local environment;  Digital Points of Interest - pointers to print, electronic
              and software information resources  related to microbial ecology.    The
              Digital Learning Center will serve as a pilot program for collaborative
              development and  delivery of K-12 interactive science learning experiences by
              scientists, educators and multimedia  designers that could ultimately be
              applied to all of the NSF Science and Technology Centers'  Education Outreach
              Programs.
