Abstract    :
                Human and other primates have the remarkable ability to use vision  to program
              and control skilled movements directed at objects in  their environment. 
              Understanding the processes and representations   underlying these skills is a
              central problem in cognitive science.   We propose to develop a focused program
              for graduate research  training in the area of visual perception and motor
              control.  In so  doing, we will capitalize on the University of Minnesota's 
              impressive faculty strength in this area.  Students in the program  will be
              co-advised by two of the 14 participating faculty,  representing behavioral,
              computational and neuroscience approaches.   Students will learn about these
              three approaches through a required  distribution of classes and
              interdisciplinary seminars.  Students  will have the opportunity to spend a
              summer in research at a  leading university of industry laboratory that
              specializes in  vision  and motor control.  The program will form a new topical
               focus within the Center for research in Leaning, Perception and  Cognition. 
              The Center has an excellent record for attracting top  students and for
              supervising them to completion of the Ph.D.  The  Center is also active in
              recruiting minority students.  Our  proposed NSF program will build on the
              infrastructure already  available through the Center.
