Abstract    :
              9454193  Keating    Summer, 1994    A three-day meeting will be organized on the
              UAF campus with leaders in collaborating school  districts, UAF faculty, and UA
              and UAF computing support personnel, with a  NorthWestNet/UACN network
              engineer.  This program will be designed to explore technical  options for
              interconnection, programmatic opportunities for simultaneously reforming
              schools  and the education of educators, and the implications, for knowledge
              access and exchange,  particularly in the sciences, of deploying
              computer-mediated communications through the Interior  region.    Fall, 1994   
              The network engineer will inventory, in collaboration with district and school
              personnel,  districts' computing capacities, existing technology
              infrastructure, and potential level of  infrastructure investment.    Although
              all possible forms of network connection will be explored, particular attention
              will be  paid to the possibilities of satellite-to-cable connections for
              opening the Internet to these rural  sites.    Winter, 1995    Consultations
              and collaborative inquiry will continue, as districts clarify the extent of
              their  commitment - physically, financially, and programmatically - to this
              collaboration, and develop  action-plans for technological deployment and
              educational improvement.  District leaders expect  to interact with each other
              and UAF colleagues from the central UAF campus, as well as those  at the rural
              campuses through dial-up access during this planning period.    Spring 1995   
              Circulation of ideas and plans for development will begin the physical and
              programmatic  interconnection of these educators, across the educational
              continuum, in Fairbanks and Alaska's  rural Interior.    Progress and plans
              will be reported and shared externally, as well. Just as work-to-date in 
              extending Internet access to our K-12 colleagues has been discussed and
              reported in national and  international meetings (Smith, Keating and Li, 1989;
              Smith and Keating 1990; Keating and  Smith, 1991; Keating and S mith, 1992; and
              Keating, 1992), I anticipate that the special case of  rural Alaska 1) in terms
              of technological deployment; 2) the explicit attention to technologically 
              linking schools and Schools of Education for systemic school improvement and
              simultaneously  improving the education of educators, which goes well beyond
              the formal partnership envisioned  by Goodlad and colleagues to regular,
              real-time communication and exchange, and; 3) the  potency of this medium for
              improving science education through the connection of scientists and  science
              educators with science teachers in schools - especially rural and remote school
              sites -  will yield even more information about internetworked computing and
              communication in  education which will be reported and shared in the
              appropriate communities.
