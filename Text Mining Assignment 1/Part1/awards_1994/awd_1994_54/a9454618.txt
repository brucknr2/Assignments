Abstract    :
              This project aims to develop and distribute a curriculum for an  associate
              degree in the fields of Geographical Information Systems  (GIS) and Global
              Positioning Systems (GPS). The projected need for  trained GIS and GPS
              technicians is high since, within the next  decade, every plane, ship and
              nearly every vehicle on the highway  will  use GIS and GPS; and governments
              will rely on the  technologies to track, tabulate, and map environmental census
              and  tax data. In cooperation with a network of eight community  colleges, an
              innovative curriculum is being planned and tested,  which would link the
              environmental, legal, and business experience  of the partner colleges with the
              lead institution's  experience in  GIS/GPS and engineering technology. The
              curriculum, and all support  materials, are being  used as a vehicle to ease
              articulation  between other schools (secondary, two-year and four-year) which
              are  interested in adding GIS/GPS to their curricula. The materials will  also
              be disseminated through national publishers, journals, and a  national
              educational association.
