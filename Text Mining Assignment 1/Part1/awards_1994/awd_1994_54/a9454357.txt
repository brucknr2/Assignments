Abstract    :
              ***  9454357  Weissglass    This is a four-year project to disseminate effective
              strategies to accelerate progress in achieving equity in mathematics education.
               Two target audiences are a national cadre of 144 professional developers and a
              California cadre of teacher leaders.  Each group will be involved in 24 days of
              workshops over two years with expectations to use these strategies in their own
              settings between workshop sessions.  National participants will be recruited in
              teams from existing and forthcoming mathematics education projects.  The
              project will provide on-going support for professional developers through
              electronic communications and a newsletter.  The project request is $ 3,099,940
              with cost-sharing as $ 809,212 or 26%.  ***
