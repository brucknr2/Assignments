Abstract    :
              9454331  Rush     Eagle-Union Community School Corporation  Institute for
              Science and Technology    This 48 month project provides five-week institutes
              for 290  inservice and 40 preservice teachers of grades K-12.  The goals  of
              the project are to provide pedagogical and philosophical  foundations for
              improving science education, develop strategies  for increasing student
              learning of science, and develop a  significantly improved delivery system to
              encourage creativity,  problem solving, critical thinking, and communications. 
                The project has four activities.  The first is the Institute for  Science and
              Technology.  Through these summer institutes,  teachers take two years to get
              fully trained and integrate  technology into the curriculum.  The second is the
              internships  and mentorship program offered at places like the Indianapolis 
              Zoo and Lilly Research.  A third component is the "Teacher in  Residence" who
              is selected each year to work with the project.   Finally, there is a
              complementary preservice component with  Purdue University that is funded
              locally.    Fifty teachers are selected in the first year form Project  INSITE.
               They receive 5 weeks of training over the two summers.   This includes formal
              training in science, work experience,  research experience, training on the
              Internet and  telecommunications, etc.  Several of these teachers will be 
              selected to help as trainers for subsequent groups each of eighty  teachers. 
              Participants are initially from Indiana.    Cost sharing is 30%.
