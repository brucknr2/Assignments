Abstract    :
              9454408  Ward    The Scientist as Humanist Project  Conscious Creations:
              Computers, Minds and Society    This 24 month project provides 4 weeks of
              summer seminars and  hands-on experiences for 24 teachers per year for two
              years in  New Hampshire and neighboring states.  K-12 teachers from 12  schools
              are selected in teams of two, one from the sciences and  one from the
              humanities.  Selection criteria include commitment  to do two days on inservice
              for colleagues in the home school and  that a network connection to be in place
              at the school.      The four week seminars are divided into one week on each of
              the  following: background on computing and its power (including  neuronets),
              networking and communities, successful K-12   programs, and finally, social and
              ethical ramifications.  Units  include hands-on time, concurrent student
              programs, reflection,  and even some role playing.  Follow-up includes
              moderated  discussion over the Internet.    Cost sharing is 26%.  ***
