Abstract    :
              The Southeast Michigan Alliance for Reinvestment in Technological  Education
              (SMARTE) is planning for Center of Excellence to develop  a comprehensive "blue
              print" of a regional advanced technological  education center.  The project
              brings together a diverse team  consisting of faculty, teachers, and staff
              members of a major state  university, community colleges, and public school
              systems, and  regional business, industry, and labor partners.The seven 
              objectives are: (a) Assess the feasibility of establishing  educational
              standards on a regional basis. (b) Explore assessment  models. (c) Identify
              models of integration of math and science for  technological education. (d)
              Explore model curricula that integrate  other competencies such as
              problem-solving, systems thinking,  communications, work habits, etc. (e)
              Evaluate the feasibility and  effectiveness of distance learning and
              alternative methods. (f)  Define the professional development needs of the
              faculty and  teachers. (g) Define how community college faculty and high school
               teachers partner with business, industry, labor and community  organizations
              to design curriculum modules and methodology that  will serve the needs of all
              partners.
