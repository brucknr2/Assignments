Abstract    :
              Seven community colleges in South Texas are planning for the  development of the
              South Texas Advanced Technological Education  Center in order to implement a
              new paradigm for teaching and  learning.  The project is ensuring an
              environment which fosters  inventive curricular revision and faculty
              development; increasing  the productivity of education and training by using
              computer-based  multimedia and telelearning systems; expanding resources for 
              innovations; empowering all faculty and students to learn how to  learn, and
              expanding collaboration between regional alliances.  The application of the
              paradigm is being accomplished through a  long-term, comprehensive, systematic
              restructuring process which  involves secondary school teachers; two-year and
              four-year college  and university faculty; administrators; practicing
              scientists and  engineers; business and industry representatives; community and
               governmental agencies; and professional organizations.  The  following goals
              form the core initiatives of the South Texas  Advanced Technological Education
              Center: (a) develop of model  curricula which reflect both integration and
              application of  concepts within the real-life/work-related context of a dynamic
               global society; (b) establish a faculty enhancement program which  provides
              faculty with development options so that they can become  the force behind
              curricular changes and innovations; (c) create a  student outreach and support
              program which recruits, retains, and  supports underrepresented populations for
              science, mathematics, and  technological careers; (d) broaden collaborative
              endeavors with  present partners and increase efforts to forge new regional 
              partnerships; and (e) support a teaching and learning environment  which
              incorporates state-of-the-art equipment for laboratories and  multimedia and
              telelearning technology in the classroom.
