Abstract    :
              A two-year project in curriculum and network development undertaken  by two
              two-year colleges -- Minnesota Riverland Technical College  (MRTC) and Austin
              Community College (ACC) -- will involve  universities and high schools --
              initially Mankato State University  (MSU) and Austin High School (AHS).  This
              project focuses on  educating builders of information highways and local
              byways.  In  other words, the focus is on "conets" -- cooperative networks that
               link communities and companies regionally as well as within  evolving national
              and global information infrastructures.The last  two years of high school and
              last two years of university  baccalaureate degrees (in engineering,
              information science, etc.)  will provide a "2+2+2" context for developing a
              two-year associate  degree in interactive mass media and networking
              communications.   Students will study core general and technical courses and
              then  select options -- tentatively called digicom (electronics),  multiware
              (computers) and intervision (mass media).  Practicums  will entail student work
              on development of a "conet" to serve local  communities and involve high
              schools as public access sites,  equipped with terminals and kiosks.This
              two-year project is  intended to help set the stage for development of both: 1)
              a CoNet  Center of Excellence, supporting curricula not just within two-year 
              colleges but within "?+2+2+2+?" education extensions; and 2) a  Southeastern
              Minnesota CoNet regional community network, as a  potential model, especially
              for rural regions in the U.S. and  globally.
