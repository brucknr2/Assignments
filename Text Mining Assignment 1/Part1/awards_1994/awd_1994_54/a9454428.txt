Abstract    :
              Abstract    ESI-9454428  Carlsen         Cornell Institute on Science and the
              Environment for Teachers    This five year project proposes to provide
              education and training for 20 teachers  each year in a three week workshop for
              a total of 100 teachers directly enhanced. An additional 100 teachers will be
              enhanced through secondary training at sites away from Cornell University by
              teams of the orignal teachers who have received up to six weeks of additional
              training. The education and training  will be centered on aquatic systems. 
              There will also be a series of academic year workshops on specific institute
              related topics.  A  requirement that teams of teachers develop and implement
              local projects will also be in place.  The goals of the project are to 1)
              Strengthen the knowledge of secondary science teachers about environmentally
              related science; 2) Update teachers' skills in using appropriate scientific and
              pedagogical methods and tools;  3)  Support a teacher leadership network; 4)
              Sponsor local curriculum projects that integrate the school sciences and
              explore science in its social context; and 5)  Promote the use of original
              student experimentation il science teaching.  This project has a cost share of
              49% of the requested support from the Foundation.
