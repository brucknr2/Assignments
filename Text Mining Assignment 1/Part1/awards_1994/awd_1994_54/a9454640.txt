Abstract    :
              This project aims to develop a sustainable and replicable industry-  academic
              partnership model for advanced technological education to  demonstrate that
              such partnerships can improve retention and  employment outlook of high risk
              Hispanic students in computerized  drafting and electronics programs. This
              partnership project will:  place students and recent graduates in related
              industries to  provide job experience through internships; include a counseling
               component based on TQM concepts applied by industry; provide job-  related
              educational experiences to additional students through  visits to industries
              including oral/written visit preparation  exercises, visit observation guide,
              post-visit reports; provide  opportunities in industries for the professional
              development of  faculty resulting in course content/instructional materials 
              preparation/modification to integrate classroom learning to  industry
              practices; and provide teaching experience to alumni who  will provide
              follow-up to internship participants. Industries  provide mentors who assist
              faculty in their professional  development, give suggestions for instructional
              materials, provide  group orientations related to industry-specific
              applications of  electronics or computerized drafting, and serve as mentors to
              the  students. A Board of Consultants, including industry members,  oversees
              the project implementation.
