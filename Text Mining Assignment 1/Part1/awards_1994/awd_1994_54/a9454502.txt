Abstract    :
              A program for training biotechnology technicians is presently  operating at
              Contra Costra Community College, with articulation  with Richmond High School.
              A Tech-prep grant funded internships at  Contra Costra College and local
              biotechnology firms for high school  students. This project proposes to assist
              science educators and  scientists to continue preparing technicians for local 
              biotechnology companies. A three week workshop for 48 teachers and  8 meetings
              during the academic year will be offered. Mentors will  do two site visits and
              telecommunications will be used to implement  the program. Funds are requested
              to assist with development of Dr.  Rosen's biotechnology kit and curriculum and
              its implementation  into many high schools with high minority enrollments.
