Abstract    :
              9454335  Stoddart    The LASERS project focuses on implementing systemic change
              in the  teaching of elementary school science to bilingual students so  that
              they have access to a challenging science curriculum that  builds on their
              cultural and linguistic resources.  In achieving  this aim, the program will
              become a vehicle for integrating,  restructuring, and enhancing the science
              curriculum and language  development programs in seven school districts and for
               establishing links to the Latino families and rural agricultural  communities
              from which students come.  The locus of the project  activities will be the
              school site.  The staff development  program will be tailored to address school
              and district  priorities, and will support teachers in the implementation and 
              planning of a comprehensive science curriculum that addresses  content and
              language development goals.  In addition, the  evaluation of the project will
              include a research component  designed to gather information that will help
              teachers forge  links between learning science and doing science in an
              authentic  context that relates to students' scientific conceptions,  language
              and culture.  ***
