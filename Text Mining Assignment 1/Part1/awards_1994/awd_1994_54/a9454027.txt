Abstract    :
                This proposal requests support from NSF for six Graduate Research 
              Traineeships in the area of Environmentally Conscious Manufacturing  (ECM). 
              Penn State will provide 20% matching funds.  The proposed  program is unique in
              the following aspects: (i) The focal point of  the Trainees' experiences will
              be the modern manufacturing  facilities availabe at the ARPA/Industrial
              consortium-funded  Manufacturing Engineering Education Partnership (MEEP)
              program;  (ii) Six specific projects in interdisciplinary areas under the 
              supervision of ten faculty members in Mechanical Engineering and  Industrial
              Management and Systems Engineering departments have been  identified for
              potential Trainees; and, (iii) academic leadership,  organization, and
              managerial training.  Three Trainees will be from  the women, underrepresented
              minorities, and the disabled students  group.  Facilites and infrastructure at
              Penn State are available  and appropriately suited for the proposed program.
