Abstract    :
                  9454337  Educational Collaborative for Greater Boston, Inc.  (EDCO)  Eileen
              McSwiney    TRANSITION:  Initiating Change in Mathematics Teaching and Learning
                 TRANSITION is a 40-month project designed to extend the knowledge and
              instruction strategies of 306 grades 3-8 teachers so they can more effectively
              support  active student learning of mathematics concepts and skills.  The
              project is a collaboration between local school district members of The
              Education Collaborative for Greater Boston, Inc. (EDCO), Education Development
              Center (EDC), and TERC research and development firms located in the greater
              Boston area.  Participants will learn the mathematics and instructional
              strategies embedded in exemplary EDC and TERC curriculum units.  They will
              teach four new units in their classrooms over a period of two years.  After one
              year of the enhancement, 36 members of the group will be recruited to serve as
              teacher leaders.  They will receive additional preparation for that building
              and district role.  The project will foster the professional development of
              teachers, enhance the school district's capacity to pilot and adopt new
              standards-based curriculum, and support systemic change.  The project is
              supported at $897,093 with a 13% cost-sharing.
