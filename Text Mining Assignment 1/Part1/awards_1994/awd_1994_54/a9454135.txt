Abstract    :
                The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, through the Center for 
              International Studies, applies to the National Science Foundation  for five
              Graduate Research traineeships to support doctoral  students in an
              interdisciplinary social science training program in  democratization.  The
              purpose of the Program is to train a new  generation of scholars in substantive
              issues and methodology which  address the intellectual and policy challenges of
              the post Cold War  global environment.  Making use of MIT's unique strengths in
              a  variety of social science disciplines, the program provides  training in
              research and teaching in the following thematic areas:  1) The Social
              Foundations of Democratic Governance; 2) Political  Economy of New Democracies;
              3) International Intervention and  Democratization; 4) Transnational Issues and
              Democratic Stability;  and 5) New Directions in Democratic Theory.  Training is
              carried  out through formal course work, interdisciplinary seminars, a 
              mandatory work-in=-progress workshop for students and faculty, and  teaching
              and research assistantships.
