Abstract    :
              Pac-TEC is a consortium of two-year colleges, secondary schools,  and businesses
              situated in the Silicon Valley with regional  partnerships in seven western
              states.  This project is developing  and distributing state-of-the-art
              instructional materials and  techniques to secondary schools, colleges,
              industry, and  government.  These materials focus on innovative mathematics, 
              science, engineering, and technology and are aimed at students who  will become
              technicians.  Emphasis is being placed on the  development of materials which
              will enhance students' problem  solving abilities, computer literacy, effective
              oral and written  communication skills, and ability to work in groups.  The
              materials  are being created around open-ended design based project work.
