Abstract    :
              The Maricopa Advanced Technology Education Center (MATEC) Planning  Project is
              planning for a Center to be operated by the Maricopa  County Community College
              District, Phoenix, Arizona, in  collaboration with other educational and
              business/industry  partners. The planning process involves representatives from
              three  educational levels-high school, community college, and  university-and
              industry partners who are stake holders in  implementing new educational
              approaches which prepare students for  the high performance workplace. Planning
              assumptions, based on an  environmental scan, provide the framework for a
              collaborative  Steering Committee to develop the vision/mission and strategies
              for  MATEC. Faculty teams, with members from the various educational  levels
              and support from business/industry representatives, are  developing the
              Operational Plan. Emphasis is on approaches which  integrate the
              teaching/learning of academic concepts in science,  mathematics, and technology
              with the development of workplace  competencies, including the skills/abilities
              necessary for  continuous learning/adaptation after entry into the workplace.
              The  overall goal is to implement MATEC which will serve as a national  model
              and clearinghouse for secondary/postsecondary advanced  technology education.
