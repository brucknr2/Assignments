Abstract    :
              9454732  McClure    The purpose of this research, "Policy Issues in Assessing
              the Role  of Public Libraries in the NII," is to better understand the 
              possible education roles and responsibilities that public libraries  might
              assume in the NII.  More specifically, the study has as its  objectives to:    
                  Develop models that describe alternative roles and       responsibilities
              (especially as they relate to public       education and literacy) that public
              libraries might assume in       the NII.       Assess the impacts of these
              models in terms of criteria such       as (1) promotion of universal access to
              networked information,       (2) costs, (3) training and personnel
              requirements, etc.       Analyze the existing Federal public library policy
              system to       determine the degree to which that policy system might have to 
                   be changed to accomplish the Administration's policy       objectives
              regarding public libraries in NII.       Offer policy recommendations to revise
              and extend the existing       public library policy system to promote proposed
              policy       objectives related to a new role for public libraries in the      
              NII.    Policy research that addresses these objectives is essential if, in 
              fact, the Administration's goal to "connect every classroom, every  clinic,
              every library (and) every hospital in America into the  national information
              superhighway by the year 2000" is to be  realized.
