Abstract    :
                The Hydrology program at the University of Colorado has recently  been added
              as a new option within the existing interdisciplinary  Geophysics Ph.D.
              Program, which previously included only solid-  earth geophysics.  Eight
              academic departments participate in this  program.  In this proposal we outline
              an interdisciplinary  educational and research plan to attract new graduate
              students to  the hydrology program.  The interdisciplinary component of our
              plan  is developed jointly with the faculty from the Program in  Atmospheric
              and Oceanic Sciences (PAOS) and the solid-earth  geophysics.  The main focus of
              this plan is to address fundamental  scale issues in hydrology as they relate
              to climate change and  water quality.  A common theme of this effort is the use
              of  statistical-dynamical techniques and non-linear dynamics to address  these
              scale issues in heterogenous natural systems.  Our efforts  will be focused on
              the following topics:         (1)  Scaling and statistical-dynamical
              characterization of            precipitation        (2)  Modeling of energy and
              moisture exchange at the land            surface       (3)  Scaling and runoff
              prediction from ungauged basins       (4)  Scale effects in subsurface
              transport in heterogeneous            aquifers       (5)  Subsurface flow in
              fractured rocks.    The proposed curriculum has the following innovative
              structural  components:  multidisciplinary education that crosses departmental 
              and college bounds; opportunity for students to participate in  related
              national and international field experiments and program;  and interaction of
              senior Ph.D. students with the faculty to design  and teach new innovative
              courses.
