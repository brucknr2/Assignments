Abstract    :
              9454714  Helfrich    The Franklin Institute proposes to establish the Science
              Learning  Network (SLN), a unique online collaborative of science museums, 
              industry and schools to support the teaching and learning of  science,
              mathematics and technology (SMT) in grades K-8.    The SLN will integrate the
              educational resources offered by  science/technology centers with the power of
              telecomputing  networking to provide powerful new support for teacher
              development  and science learning.  By December 1997 the SLN will develop and 
              evaluate the following:              UniVERSE - an online SMT database and
              software package            which will provide interactive capabilities to
              actively            and intelligently assist K-8 classroom teachers in their   
                      Internet explorations, much like an electronic            "librarian." 
                          Online Museum Collaborative - a national consortium of           
              science museums (The Franklin Institute, the            Exploratorium, Oregon
              Museum of Science and Industry,            Museum of Science - Boston, and
              Science Museum of            Minnesota) that will pool their resources and
              expertise            to create online assets and provide ongoing professional  
                       development on telecomputing networking for precollege            SMT
              teachers.              Online Demonstration Schools - a network of K-8 schools,
                         working in collaboration with consortium museums and           
              Unisys Corporation volunteers as demonstration sites for            online
              teaching and learning in SMT.    Over the course of three years, the SLN will
              provide direct support  to 180 teachers and 3,000 K-8 students in the online
              demonstration  schools.  Through existing teacher networks, each museum will
              offer  professional development for an additional 200 teachers each year.   The
              Urban Systemic Initiatives in Philadelphia and Miami offer the  potential for
              broader, systemic impact in those cities.    By the end of the grant period,
              the SLN will provide field- tested  models of a new kind of online SMT
              community through the  collaboration of science museums with industry and
              schools.  The  sustainable impact of the SLN will be assured by UniVERSE's
              status  as a publicly accessible database and software package and the 
              development of the national consortium of online museums, whose  network
              resources will be made available on an ongoing basis to  educators.  The
              three-year formative development of the online  demonstration schools will
              contribute vital data to precollegiate  school reform in SMT, showing how
              schools build capacity to become  members of the online community and
              demonstrating how teaching and  learning are enhanced by online resources.   
              Unisys Corporation has pledged its support to this project and will  provide
              matching funds for up to 40% of the total NSF award.
