Abstract    :
              9454425  Barnhart      This project implements a 5-year, multi-phase Teacher
              Enhancement  program consistent with the West Virginia Science Curriculum 
              Framework (WVSCF). As a statewide project it will reach all 7-10th  grade
              science teachers. It is a leadership project congruent with  the national
              science standards, Project 2061's tenets and the  tenets of SS&C. The project
              develops a Cadre of change agents and  teams of Science Mentor Teachers(SMT),
              at least one team for each  of West Virginia's 55 counties, and empowers them
              to provide high  quality professional development in science education to their
               peers in West Virginia.    Workshops and institutes will immerse: 35 master
              teachers in 30  days of classroom/laboratory/field experiences; 150 leader
              teachers  in 25-days of such experiences; and 1000 s/m/t educators in 12-days 
              of such experiences and teleconferencing. Content specific courses  will be
              delivered by satellite to meet content enhancement needs of  the teachers.
              There are 55 implementation outreach workshops which  will reach teachers who
              have not participated in NSF/TE workshops  previously. Administrators and
              guidance counselors will also  participate in the training. Participants may
              earn graduate or  continuing education credit. Indeed, one component of the
              project  is a Master of Arts Degree in Coordinated and Thematic Science 
              offered jointly by the graduate institutions of the state.
