Abstract    :
              9454197  Durden    This project would provide a framework through which
              youngsters can  gather, organize, manipulate, visualize, link, and interact
              with  information.  It is a unique link between the creators of the  hardware,
              scientific researchers, and educators who can see the  adaptability of this
              material for the advancement of learning.   This project would take data that
              are waiting on the "information  highway" and provide practical, learning
              context for its use by  students.  In this pilot, three teachers would be
              funded for six  months.  As a supplement to KidSat, this project would combine
              the  team's and the teachers' efforts to produce usable materials for  teachers
              and thus provide a scientific context for data use by  students.    Cost
              sharing is 27%.
