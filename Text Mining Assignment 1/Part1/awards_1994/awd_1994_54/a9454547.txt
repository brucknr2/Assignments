Abstract    :
              This project represents a partnership between the York County Area 
              Vocational-Technical School, the York City Schools, Penn State  University (at
              its York, Harrisburg and University Park Campuses),  regional industry and the
              Pennsylvania Department of Education.   The partnership is developing a
              comprehensive model for  technological education for 11th grade through the
              associate degree  level with possible extension to the baccalaureate level. 
              The  model focuses on manufacturing curriculum and educational  processes.  It
              will produce integrated and interdisciplinary  topical modules, teaching
              materials and resources for seven  courses. The modules will be developed
              collaboratively by teachers  and faculty.  The modules, which will focus on
              technical topics,  will be developed within the context of teacher/faculty
              workshops  on enhanced pedagogical techniques.  Use of the modules will 
              reinforce technical topics within the high school curriculum and  bring
              enhanced teaching techniques to the college curriculum.  All  educational
              levels will see better integration of topics and  clearly understand the
              interdependence of mathematics, science, and  technology.The project
              anticipates substantial dissemination to  secondary and postsecondary faculty
              at other Penn State locations,  and then to faculty across the state and
              nation.  The project plan  will capitalize on and integrate a variety of
              current efforts to  coordinate technological education in the state and region.
