Abstract    :
              9454411  Reid    The Earth Systems Implementation Project (ESI) is the
              culmination  of an elementary science reform effort which was first initiated 
              by the Anchorage School District's (ASD) elementary teacher in  1992 and which
              builds on the systems award winning elementary  science program.  The effort
              has involved administrators,  parents, and community members from the major
              Alaskan science  professions working with teachers to develop an advanced K-6 
              inquiry-based hands-on science curriculum.  This new curriculum  made up of
              modules from nationally validated elementary science  materials development
              projects will be implemented in each of the  districts 58 elementary schools. 
              To accomplish this the project  will prepare approximately 1,000 elementary
              school teachers with  the content and teaching strategies needed to implement
              the  program.  The project will also involve over 2,000 parents to  work
              directly with teachers in support of the project.    Cost sharing will be 69%
              of the NSF funds.  ***
