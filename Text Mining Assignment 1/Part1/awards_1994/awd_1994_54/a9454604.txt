Abstract    :
              This project involves an interdisciplinary development of technical  mathematics
              instructional modules, emphasizing the problem-solving  approach, the
              scientific method and realistic, real-world problems.  Representatives from
              business and industry, in particular, those of  the Princeton Plasma Physics
              Laboratory, are providing technical  and industrial perspectives on scientific
              and engineering  applications. The graphing calculator linked with a new
              portable  sensor and probe setup, called the Calculator Based Laboratory  (CBL)
              system, are the technological instructional tools chosen for  classroom and
              laboratory use. Over a two year span a total of 10  curriculum teams, comprised
              of Middlesex County College mathematics  and science/engineering faculty,
              working cooperatively with  teachers from local high schools, are producing 30
              instructional  modules, to be used at the secondary school level as well as in 
              technical college curricula. A series of training conferences and  workshops
              are being held to assist participants in mastery of these  technological tools,
              as well as the most effective problem-solving  and cooperative-learning
              strategies. The instructional modules are  being disseminated through the MCC
              network of local high schools,  a consortium of regional community colleges,
              the NJ Statewide  Systemic Initiative for Improvement of Math and Science, and 
              professional mathematics associations.
