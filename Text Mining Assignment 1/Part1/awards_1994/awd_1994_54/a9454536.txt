Abstract    :
              The aim of this project is to create an instrumentation calibration  curriculum
              strand for engineering technology, technician and  science students. The
              curriculum  focuses on a dedicated laboratory  consisting of three independent
              but integratable modules providing  hands-on experience with equipment
              measuring: (1) voltage, current,  resistance, and power; (2) fluid flow; and
              (3) pressure,  temperature, and volume.The resultant curriculum  consists of
              ten  modified or new courses, affecting 16 engineering technology and  science
              faculty and offered to students in seven different majors  and directly and
              indirectly to area high school students and  college students statewide. Two
              years of development and  evaluation, will produce a replicable model for how
              two-year  colleges can adequately produce the type of broadly-educated 
              technician needed to lead in instrumentation calibration design and  operation
              in high-performance industries.
