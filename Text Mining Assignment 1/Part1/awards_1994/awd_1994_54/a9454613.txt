Abstract    :
              Multimedia-based curriculum materials have been developed to  support technology
              education in data acquisition, embedded systems,  and multimedia and high speed
              networks. These materials, which  include networked laboratory manuals, text
              and student exercises,  are available in a modular format to facilitate their
              incorporation  into technology education courses at other institutions. A 
              significant evaluation component is included to assess the  effectiveness of
              the multimedia materials, especially with respect  to learning outcomes for
              members of underrepresented groups. Six  one-week summer workshops (two each
              year over a three-year period)  are offered to disseminate products completed
              in the project and to  assist faculty to develop the capability to author
              effective  multimedia-based instructional materials.
