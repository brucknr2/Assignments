Abstract    :
              Interactive multimedia instruction (IMI) is known to be an  effective method of
              delivering technical skill instruction to  learners across many educational
              areas. This project  merges the  Instrument Society of America's INVOLVE IMI
              system with the current  Electronics program to provide a specialized Associate
              of Applied  Science instrumentation curriculum. The principal aims of the 
              project are to increase the number of instrumentation career  seekers, build
              education pathways from high schools through  four-year and higher education in
              partnership with industry, train  a more culturally-diverse and gender-balanced
              work force and  improve learning efficiency. The project will  produce highly 
              skilled individuals able to track the process control industry's  transition
              into the evolving automated workplace of tomorrow.
