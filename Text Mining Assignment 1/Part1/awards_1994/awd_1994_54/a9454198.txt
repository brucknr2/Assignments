              the project    o  Defining more precisely the target audiences and strategies
              for      reaching parents, teachers, and underserved populations    o 
              Performing additional front-end analysis of project need    o  Reviewing known
              studies of the impact of workshops and exhibits      in introducing new
              educational technologies    o  Defining further the exhibit surround and
              exhibition    o  Developing strategies for continuously updating the exhibition
                 o  Developing further the workshop components    o  Developing detailed
              evaluation plans
