Abstract    :
              The primary purpose of this project is to create a model technology  educational
              program beginning with one selected discipline and  adapting it to other
              engineering technologies. The project will  also create a model of
              collaboration between secondary schools,  two-year and four-year colleges,
              educational and work force  agencies, professional organizations, and private
              industry.  This project proposes an informal consortium between Houston's 
              Spring Branch Independent School District, the Northwest College of  the
              Houston Community College System, the College of Technology of  the University
              of Houston, and selected private industry partners.  The project will encompass
              1) a needs assessment of industrial  educational and training requirements, 2)
              curriculum development at  the secondary, community college, and four-year
              college levels, and  3) faculty/student development through educational and
              industry  mentor/apprenticeship opportunities, and 4) and evaluation of the 
              projects performance.NSF Form 1295(9/93)
