Abstract    :
              9454767  Sadler    We are proposing to network together several remote
              telescopes and  to test the feasibility of their use by students from grades
              4-12.   We will design and test specialized software that will allow  students
              to work with each other and to collaborate with  astronomers on research
              projects.  Remote control of telescopes has  the potential to transform
              conventional science classes and to  serve students with physical disabilities.
               Such a network will  allow students, even in communities that are resource
              poor, access to  powerful tools that will increase their educational
              opportunities.   This project will examine the problems inherent in using
              remote  instruments and test solutions which will improve ease-of-use and 
              accessibility to a wide audience.    This project will provide a model to be
              followed in placing other  remote scientific instruments on the Internet for
              educational  purposes.  It could prove a catalyst in encouraging the 
              collaboration of scientists and pre-college students in research  projects.  It
              could also result in the discovery of new asteroids,  comets, and variable
              stars by our nation's youth.
