Abstract    :
              9454397  Zielinski    BISCITS or Biotechnology Initiative for Systemic Change in
              the Teaching of Science is a program that will change the way our young people
              view modern technology in science.  The first and foremost way to do this is
              enhance our nation's teachers ability to effect such change.  In order to
              succeed, BISCITS will start by retraining the workforce at both the middle and
              high school level by recruiting teacher teams from school districts in the
              Pennsylvania area.  This retraining has many facets.  First, teachers need to
              become current and fluent about molecular biology and biotechnology subject
              matter and the types of employment open to those students wishing to pursue
              these areas as careers.  Also, BISCITS will provide sessions discussing ethical
              issues that are being raised by biotechnology.  BISCITS will make the teacher
              participants "biotechnology-literate."
