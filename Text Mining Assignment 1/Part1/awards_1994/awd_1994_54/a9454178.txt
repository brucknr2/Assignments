Abstract    :
              9454178  Kelemanik                                        Dissemination Plan for
              the Industry Volunteers Model     This is a dissemination/conference project to
              replicate an  "Industry Volunteers in the Classroom" model developed over  the
              past several years at EDC.  The model involves a  collaborative effort between
              private companies and schools,  and can be made a component of many different
              kinds of  teacher enhancement projects. Companies in the project  target area
              agree to provide release time for volunteer  employees, so that these employees
              can take over as  substitutes while the classroom teachers attend teacher 
              enhancement workshops during the regular school day.  The  present project has
              2 components: (1) "getting the word out"  to potentially interested parties
              (e.g., PIs of SSIs and  USIs; other TE projects, etc); and (2) providing
              technical  assistance to those seriously interested in implementing  their own
              Volunteer model.  Such assistance includes:  providing a "Handbook" that
              details how such cooperative  ventures can be initiated, organized, and
              executed; sending  an EDC resource team to the potential implementation site; 
              telephone conferencing, etc.  At the end of the project,  there is a 1-day
              conference at EDC for those groups who are  ready to begin their
              implementation.      Cost sharing is 5% of the NSF contribution.
