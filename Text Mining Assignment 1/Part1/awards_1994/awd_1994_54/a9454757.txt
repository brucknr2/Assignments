Abstract    :
              9454757  Williamson    WhaleNet is an interdisciplinary, hands-on, collaborative
               monitoring project to foster science education and interest in  schools across
              the nation utilizing telecommunications.  WhaleNet  will ultimately incorporate
              continued contact among educators,  students, scientists, and research programs
              to enhance K-12 science  education.    Through interaction with cooperating
              scientists and research  institutions, students will be able to participate in
              research  projects on and utilize data from the marine ecosystem, including 
              marine mammal identification and migration patterns.    WhaleNet Program Goals 
                          to utilize telecommunications and other advanced           
              technologies to allow cooperation and communication among            students,
              teachers, scientists, and marine research            institutions;           
              to involve students in real-time interdisciplinary            scientific
              research and education, by using data            collected on classroom whale
              watches, data from existing            research programs and data from new
              research projects by            participating organizations using high
              technology            devices;            to establish collaboration (through a
              nation-wide            network) among business, education and research         
                institutions, with the goal of enhancing student            involvement and
              interest in the marine environment;            to establish a nation-wide
              network of schools, students,            educators and scientists who are
              interested in            integrating WhaleNet into the K-12 curriculum as an   
                      interdisciplinary theme;            to connect students to research
              data, students to            scientists/naturalists, students to students via  
                       telecommunications to stimulate interest in           
              interdisciplinary learning;            to make related curriculum materials
              available to            educators electronically.    Interdisciplinary K-12
              curriculum units and interactive  CD-ROM  materials will be available to
              participating educators and students  so that they can be used with the
              WhaleNet program.  Throughout the  academic year students and educators will
              have access to volunteer  WhaleNet scientists via the Internet for their
              inquiries.  Students  and educators will also have access to past and current
              data so  that they can experience a more comprehensive academic program on  a
              year-round basis.    WhaleNet will enable students to use research data in
              real-time to  generate involvement and interest in scientific investigations 
              while fostering an interdisciplinary approach to learning,  research, critical
              thinking, and problem solving.
