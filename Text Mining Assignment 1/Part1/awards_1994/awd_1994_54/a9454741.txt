Abstract    :
              9454741  Beldham    Project Goal  Any successful effort to restructure education
              using technology  will require substantial user involvement in the planning and
               decision-making stages of that effort.  The Regional Technology  Planning
              Project will bring together representatives of those  interested in improving
              K-12 education in our region into a formal  consortium that will develop a plan
              of action for creating a  flexible regional networking infrastructure and for
              using that  infrastructure to enhance teacher professionalization, student 
              achievement and school restructuring in the K-12 education  community.   
              Project Objectives         1.   To create a formal regional consortium out of
              the            Technology Steering Committee.         2.   To conduct an
              assessment of what is currently available            in terms of
              networking/distance learning hardware and            software in the 10
              intermediate units in western            Pennsylvania.         3.   To conduct
              an assessment of the attitudes of teachers,            administrators, parents
              and students toward technology  and            its role in educational
              innovation and reform.         4.   To evaluate other regional technology
              initiatives in            terms of how we can apply their experiences to a plan
              of            our own.         5.   To write a formal plan for implementing a
              flexible            regional networking infrastructure including           
              recommendations on equipment, personnel, teacher            training,
              cooperative projects among consortium members,            projects for diverse
              student populations, connecting to            statewide, national and
              international networks,            administration, and funding.
