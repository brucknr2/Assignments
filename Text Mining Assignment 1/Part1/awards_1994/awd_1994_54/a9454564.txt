Abstract    :
              The Science Technology: Knowledge and Skills curriculum project,  (SciTeKS),
              will fill the void of science-oriented technical courses  in Tech Prep and
              similar school-to-work transition high school  programs.  The project is
              designed to develop printed and  multimedia student and teacher materials for
              large context modules  involving chemistry, biology, and earth/space sciences.
              The  development will include curriculum design recommendations and  models,
              multimedia instructional and reference materials for  students, suggestions and
              models for implementation, support for  teachers, and guidance for assessment. 
              The curriculum will be  designed to develop in high school students skills in
              teamwork,  problem solving, communication, and other capabilities considered 
              critical for their success in the workplace and/or in further  education.  The
              SciTeKS project will provide a two-year science  curriculum for a variety of
              school-to-work programs.  Students  completing SciTeKS will be ideally prepared
              to enter immediate  employment or college technician programs based on biology,
               chemistry, or earth/space sciences. The pedagogical strategies will  be
              developed by a team of high school, college, and
