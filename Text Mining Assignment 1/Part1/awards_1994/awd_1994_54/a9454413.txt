Abstract    :
              9454413  Hamner    The collaboration between the UCLA Marine Science Center and
              the  Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) is designed to create  a cadre
              of 160 teachers (grades 5-12) trained to change and  strengthen science
              instruction throughout the system using a marine  science model.  This model
              has been developed over a period of  three years and was funded by NSF.  This
              model (i.e., Marine  Science Teacher Education Program: M-STEP) enhances the
              science  skills of teachers in a classroom and ocean-b program that  emphasizes
              a marine thematic integrative science approach to  Science education.  The
              ocean sciences are interdisciplinary so  that they taught as an integrated,
              problem solving, hands on  curriculum using the common theme of the marine
              environment.    Experiences in the Leadership In Marine Science Program (LIMS)
              will  develop in teachers the skills necessary to conduct classroom, 
              laboratory and field research in marine sciences with their  students.  They
              will also be effective leaders in peer training.   Because of LAUSD's new
              cluster organization of schools, these  teachers will impact four school
              clusters consisting of elementary,  middle, and senior high schools with about
              a total of 35,000  students.    The program is aimed at systemic change through
              this integrative  and thematic approach to science curriculum organization.  It
              is  designed not only to change the way that science is delivered in  these
              clusters, but it is also focused on attracting young minority  students into
              universities and into the sciences.  It provides and  presents a vehicle for
              further professionalization of teachers by  offering new science content,
              leadership skills development,  collaborative peer teaching training, and the
              improvement of what  is taught and how it is delivered in the classroom of the
              LAUSD.   LIMS teachers will provide the first cluster-based science 
              dissemination programs for LAUSD.
