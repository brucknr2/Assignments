Abstract    :
              This project has been designed to significantly improve the quality  of
              technological education in Southwest Virginia by increasing the  capability of
              five community colleges to respond to industry-  identified needs for advanced
              manufacturing technology (AMT)  education.  The project activities will serve
              as a model for rural  appalachian colleges and will be coordinated through the
              Southwest  Virginia Advanced Manufacturing Center, formed through a consortium 
              of five community colleges.  The project involves two components:  1)
              enhancement of faculty skills and knowledge to teach the  advanced technologies
              required by AMT curricular courses via "back-  to-practice" internships in
              industry and attendance at seminars and  workshops, and 2) initial development
              of common AMT curricular  courses by cross-disciplinary teams, comprised of
              faculty from the  five participating community colleges, representatives from 
              regional business and industry, and faculty from area high schools  and senior
              institutions.
