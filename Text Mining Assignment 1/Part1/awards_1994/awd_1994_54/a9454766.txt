Abstract    :
              9454766  Billings    The Community of Learners is the joint proposal of two
              Maine public  school districts and Bowdoin College that have already worked 
              together successfully to obtain and implement the Beacon School  Project,
              largely funded by the National Science Foundation and part  of its State
              Systemic Initiative.  This proposal has five major  objectives that have
              far-reaching educational significance:    1) To accelerate and enrich the
              intellectual dialogue within the  region through the development of an
              information network.    2) To reach out to the community and share developments
              in science,  mathematics, and technology.    3) To empower students
              intellectually through the use of  technology.    4) To provide teachers with
              access to current information so that  they can develop new approaches to
              curriculum and learning.    5) To provide a level playing field for all
              students in order to  eliminate distinctions based on gender and socio-economic
              class.    The proposal depends on four related strategies.  They are:    1) To
              develop a data network that connects public schools, local  libraries, and
              community centers, to households, to the Internet,  and to a regional
              voice/data interactive video system.    2) To establish a broad-based program
              for the education and  training of a Community of Learners that includes
              students,  teachers, citizens, and businesses.    3) To construct a model for
              teaching that focuses on problem-  finding and problem-solving.    4) To
              disseminate practices and findings both regionally and  nationally to encourage
              other districts to develop Communities of  Learners of their own.
