Abstract    :
              9454642  Werner                                                 This project is
              developing coordinated high school and 2-year  college biotechnology curricula.
              Supporting activities include  teacher and faculty training, industry mentor
              education, program  materials development, job shadowing, and the recruitment
              and  retention of underrepresented groups of students. Principal  collaborators
              are a two-year college, high schools, 4-year colleges  and universities,
              biotechnological industry, government, and public  schools. Biotechnology
              programs are being articulated for different  educational levels, and major
              developments include classroom and  multimedia materials. Also, developed
              materials are being  disseminated through various media, such as publications,
              videos,  electronic linkages, workshops, and conferences.
