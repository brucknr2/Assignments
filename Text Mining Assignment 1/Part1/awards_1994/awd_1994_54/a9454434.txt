Abstract    :
                The theme of our program is particle simulation.  In order to solve  physical
              problems, we will include:         The computer science, applied math and
              physical science       necessary to perform state-of-the-art simulations on
              massively       parallel computers.         The creation of tools to use
              parallel computers to drive       visualization engines.         Integration of
              simulation with experimentation.  For large       experimental projects,
              simulations are key to their planning       and interpretation.    By
              concentrating on a single computational theme, we will build a  cohesive
              program spanning several departments.  The training  program will be jointly
              administered by Astronomy, Chemistry and  Computer Science.  Our program has
              the following key features:         It is a cohesive multidisciplinary program
              with a formal       mechanism of joint supervision of students between      
              departments.         We will train scientists and engineers in the use of high 
                   performance computers for simulation, analysis and       visualization.   
                   We have arranged summer internships at government labs and in      
              industry.         We propose a specific program of action to improve the number
                    of women and minorities in our program until it reflects the      
              diversity of the US population.
