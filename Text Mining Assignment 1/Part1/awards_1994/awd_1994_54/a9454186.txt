Abstract    :
              9454186     Brett    MCNC  Presidential Awardees in Communication Using the
              Internet    This one year project would pilot a program to train Presidential 
              Awardees.  A pilot group of 30 teachers receives training on the  basics of
              connectivity and accessing and sharing resources over  the Internet.  Through
              this pilot, the project team learns the  breadth and depth of training
              required, the type and extent of  ongoing technical supports needed, and the
              viability of using the  Presidential Awardees as experts for other educators
              who have  access to the Internet.    The training is held for one week in North
              Carolina and draws 30  teachers from the pool of 1994 Presidential Awardees in 
              mathematics and science, elementary and secondary.  In addition  to the formal
              workshop, support materials are developed and  tested to help teachers use SLIP
              accounts and networked services.   Ongoing support is provided by MCNC and by
              teachers who  participated in the earlier Global Schoolhouse project.  The 
              project may extend to supporting awardees who were not selected  for the formal
              training if feasible.    Cost sharing is not specified but the project does
              incude  contributions and expense sharing provided by the individual 
              participants and by company donations such as AT & T.  MCNC is  not responsible
              for any of these donations.  ***
