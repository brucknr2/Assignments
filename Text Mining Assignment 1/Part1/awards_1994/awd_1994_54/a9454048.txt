Abstract    :
                The Penn State Graduate Research Traineeships focus on preparing  Mathematics
              Education or Science Education researchers in the areas  of cognition and
              technology.  Increasing access to new technologies  are suggesting fundamental
              questions about the content and nature  of mathematics learning and science
              learning in these environments.   The program includes courses and research
              experiences which provide  a firm foundation in research on mathematics or
              science teaching  and learning, a strong mathematics or science background (at
              or  beyond the masters level), a cutting-edge knowledge of emerging 
              technologies, an expertise in both qualitative and quantitative  research
              methods (with special emphasis on using interviews to  probe student
              understanding), and a deep understanding of cognition  and learning.  Trainees
              are involved in research on the teaching  and learning throughout their
              program.  In addition, the program  centers on the establishment and
              development of an international  dialogue on research issues culminating in an
              international  symposium on setting a research agenda on the impact of
              technology  on the teaching and learning of mathematics and science.  The 
              program is designed to prepare individuals at all levels  (elementary through
              undergraduate) whose research can contribute to  the knowledge base regarding
              the impact of technology on the  teaching and learning of mathematics or
              science.
