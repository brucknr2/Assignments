Abstract    :
                In 1993, NYU was selected by the NYS Science and Technology  Foundation as the
              site for the Center for Advance Technology (CAT)  in Digital Multimedia
              Production, Publishing and Education.  It is  the only such Multimedia CAT in
              New York State (the 12 others  concentrate in 'hard sciences' including
              Robotics and  BioTechnology).  Thus, not only has New York State targeted 
              Multimedia for intensive development (coinciding with the NSF  selecting "use
              of multimedia" for eligibility in Computer Science:   Human Interface Design
              for Access to Computers and Networked  Information (CS/HID) under the GRT
              program), but NYU has been  selected as a key Multimedia site in New York.   
              We have begun to establish facilities for the CAT, and are  developing a
              greatly expanded Multimedia degree program with  provides a full-scale,
              project-based set of graduate courses which  will emphasize computer science,
              but also include cognitive and  perceptual psychology, and graphic design
              issues.  This will form  part of our regular Computer Science "with
              specialization in  multimedia".    Our state grant charges us to cooperate
              actively with NY area  multimedia firms; we expect these firms to offer many
              internship  opportunities to our students.
