Abstract    :
              The planning for the Advanced Biotechnology Education Center  represents a
              collaborative effort between California Community  Colleges, the California
              State University system, the University of  California system, national
              laboratories, California secondary  school districts and biotechnology
              industries.  Providing 50% of  the biotechnology industry and 17% of higher
              education  opportunities, California recognizes the imperative to plan a 
              Center that addresses the needs of industry and the needs for basic  science
              education and science literacy.  This project will develop a complete and
              comprehensive plan to  target needs for all students in biotechnology and basic
              science  courses, especially those from under represented populations, and 
              provide a national model for curriculum improvement and development  at each
              stage in the educational/occupational continuum in  biotechnology. California
              Biotechnology Consortium membership and  a Center Steering Committee will
              provide leadership for planning  curriculum, faculty enhancement, equipment
              needs, evaluation and  dissemination.  Five leaders in education have been
              selected for  the roles of lead principal investigator and co-principal 
              investigators.  Conferences, electronic networking and  teleconferences will
              provide the means to develop written reports  and a detailed proposal for an
              Advanced Biotechnology Education  Center.
