Abstract    :
              9454390  Nanney    POLARIS the Project On Leading Alaska Reform In Science is a
              four  year program to effect comprehensive science education reform in  schools
              along the length of the Alaska Highway, from Kenai to  Fairbanks. Sixty leader
              teachers, from grades seven through nine,  will participate in a series of two
              six-day academies each summer,  a three day winter short course and ten
              follow-up meetings during  the academic year. Workshop content and pedagogy
              will be merged so  that teachers will learn in a format that their students are
               expected to use. The science content will be guided by local needs,  national
              science education reform efforts and the emerging NRC  standards. Reflecting
              its comprehensive nature these teachers will  also learn assessment techniques,
              applications of technology and  leadership skills and strategies. Other middle
              and  high school  science teachers in the participating districts will be
              included in  the project through intensive workshop experiences lasting one 
              hundred and five hours. These second tier workshops sill be  conducted by the
              leader teachers. The Anchorage School District  will be the lead district. The
              extraordinary contrast between urban  centers and road-accessible remote rural
              communities will be  alleviated by partnering the resources of each using
              electronic  networks.
