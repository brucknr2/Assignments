Abstract    :
              9454746  Matray    The Ultimate Electronic Field Trip...from abyss to Andromeda 
              supports the creation of K-12 testbeds, whose respective teams join  with
              science researchers and business/industry communities to  create, test and
              pilot innovative approaches to science education  that will serve as a proving
              ground for information technology,  learning and teaching, and work world
              interactions.  Given the goal  of life long learning, the philosophical premise
              shall be that  students/clients ask their own questions, pose and solve their
              own  problems...where students/clients and educators both function in  the
              roles of facilitators and constructors of their  learning...where volition is
              the moving force rather than  motivation; it will be organized around the
              teaching/learning  process utilizing technology for cognition and instructional
               systems designs for the teaching of science.  The parameters of the  project
              reside in the area of regional and global marine and  environmental studies and
              astronomy.  Three overarching and  interactive elements guide the process to
              use a network linking  testbed classrooms with video images and data from
              research  institutes, museum, and aquaria to promote interactive learning 
              through virtual field trip experience: high-speed data  communications access
              (ATM, ISDN and Frame Relay) and computer  technologies are made available to
              K-14, IHEs, scientific research  communities, and libraries by business and
              industry partners.   Given access, educators, scientists, engineers, and
              technicians  will work collaboratively to sort and identify relevant electronic
               data sources based on real world applications and work world  interactions. 
              This information, both asynchronous and real time,  becomes available via a
              Regional Environmental Electronic Library  (REEL) to the student/client groups
              involved in the testbed sites  and field trip development.    Access to the
              ultimate field trip utilizing such an infrastructure  will result in:          
               improved quality and eff ectiveness of instruction and            learning in
              the areas of regional/global marine and            environmental studies and
              astronomy;            the use of data communications to increase access to     
                    informational, instructional and technological resources           
              (voice, video and data);            models for integrating the most
              cost-effective            telecommunications networking into the school science
                         curriculum;            a migration model to allow schools and/or
              agencies to            move from one science tier to the next as their needs
              and            applications change;            improvement of learning
              resources management;            definitions of the role of voice, video and
              data            communications in teacher training;            a model for
              product and service dissemination,            collaboration between diverse
              agencies, and military base            closure reuse blending with education.
