Abstract    :
              The Mt. Hood Community College (MHCC) Mathematics Division is  developing,
              implementing and disseminating a comprehensive  Application-based, Technology
              supported, One-track Mathematics  Curriculum (ATO) for all students
              (baccalaureate prep and technical  prep).The four levels of study incorporate
              the National Council  of Teachers of Mathematics Curriculum and Evaluation
              Standards  (NCTM) and the Secretary's Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills 
              (SCANS) recommendations.ATO responds to the education reform  movement in
              mathematics while addressing: the lack of appropriate  course materials
              targeting community college students; the lack of  a framework to train adjunct
              mathematics instructors (on which the  community college heavily relies); and,
              the lack of articulated  curriculum for the same level of mathematics taught in
              middle  schools, high schools, community colleges and four-year schools.   The
              following are the three objectives for development and  implementation of the
              ATO Program.OBJECTIVE 1. Develop and publish  course materials for Levels II
              and III (applications oriented  algebra) of ATO: a textbook for each level that
              fully integrates  the use of technology; and, a hands-on activities and
              real-world  interdisciplinary applications supplement.OBJECTIVE 2. Develop a 
              framework for the ongoing staff development of community college  adjunct
              mathematics faculty to enable them to effectively deliver  a coherent
              mathematics curriculum.OBJECTIVE 3. Develop in  collaboration with middle
              schools and high schools in the community  college district an articulated
              coherent mathematics curriculum  that addresses content-based proficiency
              assessment strategies, and  supports uniform implementation of the NCTM
              Standards in  mathematics education.Methods to accomplish these objectives
              build  on previously-established team efforts at MHCC, partnerships with 
              industry, and collaborative activities with other schools including  middle
              schools, high schools, and four-year colleges.Northwest  Region al Educational
              Laboratory is instrumental in the evaluation  of the project, along with the
              Program Management  Evaluation/Assessment Advisory Team.
