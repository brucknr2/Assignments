Abstract    :
                This proposal outlines an interdisciplinary traineeship program for  the study
              of cognition and environmental contexts.  The program  brings together
              psychologist, anthropologists, and other social  scientists who are interested
              in the scientific study of graduate  students who will be knowledgeable about
              both methods and theory in  both anthropology and cognitive science.  The
              innovative structural  components include psychology, participation in
              interdisciplinary  research seminars meeting weekly throughout their graduate
              careers  and participation in research at several field sites and 
              collaborative research installations already established in  locations in many
              parts of the world by University of Michigan  scientists.  the students trained
              by such a program are expected by  be uniquely qualified to develop a 
              scientific understanding of  cultural aspects of cognitive structures and
              processes.
