Abstract    :
              The proposed planning grant, "Planning a Center for Advancement of  Emerging
              Technology Applications," presents a plan by six coalition  two-year technical
              colleges in Tennessee to develop a Center in  Tennessee that will serve as a
              national model. Research is  presented which demonstrates the importance of
              coalition building  and the need for a timely linkage to take the information
              sharing  from those engaged in development of new technologies and their 
              applications to the companies that can actually put the  applications into
              practice. The goal of the proposed planning grant  is to prepare a plan that
              lays the groundwork for a Center that  will function as a clearinghouse.
              Through this clearinghouse,  information will be shared statewide and
              nationally through  conferences, Internet communication and published
              materials, so  that colleges and universities can provide education for
              graduates  going into the technology fields.The proposed center will serve as 
              an intermediary between research organizations and the companies  which use the
              technology. Using research data from these contacts,  the center can summarize
              ongoing projects and anticipate the needs  of the manufacturing and service
              sectors in terms of technology  applications. Ultimately, a research-community
              college-industry  alliance will develop, producing a defined channel and
              improved  process for increasing productivity.Six Tennessee two-year colleges 
              are forming this coalition to develop a plan that is producing a  framework for
              identifying and developing emerging engineering  technology programs.
              Components for linkages with industry, other  colleges and universities and
              high schools are important in the  project.
