Abstract    :
              This project addresses the critical regional need of the medical  community and
              medical industry for well-trained biomedical  electronic technicians by
              developing an enhancement to the existing  Biomedical Electronic Engineer
              Technology program. The development  effort specifies an interdisciplinary
              curriculum to assure that  students acquire strong mathematics, science,
              computer,  telecommunications, and other critical thinking skills as part of 
              their degree program. The project encompasses planning for  curriculum
              development, faculty enhancement, and laboratory  improvement and establishes a
              stronger partnership with the medical  community and industry to increase
              internship and co-op  opportunities. In addition, the project addresses
              articulation  arrangements with secondary schools, and two- and four-year 
              colleges.
