Abstract    :
              9454362  Cook        Description:    This 48 month project directly enhances the
              science understanding  and teaching skills of elementary school teachers by
              establishing  a network of collaborative linkages between classrooms and the 
              Arboretum through telecommunications technology, structured  science
              expeditions, student investigations, and regular  opportunities for teacher
              reflection.  The project goals are: to  increase knowledge of botany and
              zoology; to provide access to  the Internet; to create network communities of
              students and  teachers from resource-rich and resource-poor schools working 
              with each other and with scientists from the Arboretum; to  support student
              investigations; to offer a family science  program; to work with and within the
              SSI and the Boston USI; and  to disseminate the model to other similar centers.
               These goals  are accomplished through summer workshops for teachers, student 
              field studies, family science programs, and  evaluation/dissemination.  Funding
              is provided for the teacher  training in the summers (with follow up) and the 
              evaluation/dissemination.      In its initial stages, the project works with
              three school  communities adjoining the Arboretum in Boston, Massachusetts.  
              Two-hundred and seventy elementary school teachers receive  courses, field
              experiences and direct support from the Arboretum.   An additional 150
              teachers, primarily from within the state,  receive training through
              telecommunications and local support.    Cost sharing is estimated at 55%.  ***
