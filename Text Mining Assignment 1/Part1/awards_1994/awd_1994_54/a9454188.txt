Abstract    :
              9454188  Stefanich    This project is conducting a two-day conference (March
              21-22, 1995) prior to the National  Science Teachers Association Convention in
              Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  The conference will  include invited papers,
              panels, and working groups evaluating the current practices and future 
              directions in science education for students with disabilities.  The purpose of
              the conference  is to educate science teacher educators, science teachers, and
              professionals providing services  and/or equipment to persons with disabilities
              as to what resources and strategies are effective  for quality science
              education for students with disabilities.  General goals of the conference 
              are:    1.   To model instructional strategies and provide specific suggestions
              which can enhance       and contribute to the learning and participation of
              students with disabilities in the       science classroom and laboratory.    2.
                To increase awareness of technological and educational advancements which can
                    enhance and contribute to the learning and participation of students with
              disabilities.    Participants will be provided with opportunities to actually
              experience effective instructional  practice for persons with disabilities
              while receiving guidance and direction from an educator  and a scientists, with
              the disability, in each of four disability areas along with a science  educator
              and special educator with expertise in the area of cognitive impairments.  
              Recommendations for improved practice will be shared and responded to by
              participants.   Information in areas of career concerns, teacher education,
              methods, materials/programs,  dissemination, evaluation and assessment, and
              educational organizations and agencies will be  compiled and prepared into a
              document for conference participants.  The proceedings will be  completed
              following the conference, and become available to interested individuals and 
              agencies at a nominal cost.  ***
