Abstract    :
              9454375  Jaeger    This project is for ten years with a request for funding from
              NSF  for five of those years.  The project is a long term, collaborative 
              commitment to the schooling of a generation of people and  communities facing
              complex issues of human impact upon the  environment:  logging and forest
              health problems, rangeland  management decisions, endangered species
              restoration, regional  economic difficulties, and aesthetic and recreational
              needs of  public lands.  Designed to reach teachers of elementary and middle 
              school youth in the eastern region of Oregon, the enhancement grant  will
              provide institutes, extended studies, telecommunications, and  ongoing
              resources for educators as they study these issues and as  they provide
              analogous opportunities for their own students to  become problem solvers.   
              This project is designed to give 200 teachers and administrators in  eastern
              Oregon the background, practice and ongoing support to help  become classroom
              facilitators of Ecosystems Management problem  solving.  The first year will
              focus on Multimedia development,  recruitment, organization and arrangement for
              field sites, creation  of resources, and training of faculty and staff.  After
              the project  is in place, there will be summer institutes, year long
              follow-ups,  mini-sessions, evaluations, and research projects.     The project
              requested $1,249,325 from NSF with  institutions/agencies and school districts
              providing 27% in cost  sharing.
