Abstract    :
              CCITT is a national consortium of twelve community colleges who are  planning
              for a National Center of Excellence in Advanced Technology  Education.
              Consortium members are:  Brevard Community College, FL;  Cuyahoga Community
              College, OH; Foothill College, CA; John C.  Calhoun College, AL; Pasadena City
              College, CA; Pearl River  College, MS; Prince George's Community college, MD;
              Thomas Nelson  Community College, VA; and Houston, TX - based Consortium
              Members  San Jacinto Community College, College of the Mainland, Alvin 
              College, and Lee College. These twelve community colleges are  linked through
              their involvement with, and long-term specialized  instructional support for
              nine NASA Field Centers.  Linkages are  established with area universities and
              school systems to maximize  articulation of technological education
              programs.The Center is  developing plans to establish a national clearinghouse
              for  curricular and faculty development programs as well as educational  media
              supporting these programs to infuse science and mathematics  into technological
              education programs.  Curriculum design, faculty  enhancement, outreach
              services, media development and product  dissemination activities are being
              designed to enhance the quality  of advanced technological education programs
              at community colleges  and technical institutions nationwide.  An advanced
              national  telecommunications and bulletin board delivery system is being 
              established to facilitate cost-effective sharing of information  among faculty
              on a national basis, and to support creative models  for distance learning.
