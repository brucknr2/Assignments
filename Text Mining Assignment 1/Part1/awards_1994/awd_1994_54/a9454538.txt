Abstract    :
              An industrial controls laboratory is developed in the Computer  Integrated
              Manufacturing (CIM) Center to support a course in  industrial control systems
              for the CIM curriculum of the Southern  New Jersey CIM Consortium (6 county
              colleges in addition to NJIT).  This laboratory also supports a similar
              non-credit short course for  manufacturers and a professional development
              course for educators.  The emphasis is on Programmable Logic Controller (PLC)
              programming  and applications to industrial controls. Class notes and
              laboratory  experiments are developed and made available to the engineering 
              technology community.
