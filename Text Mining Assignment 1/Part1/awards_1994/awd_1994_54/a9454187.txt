Abstract    :
              9454187  Campbell    This is a two-year, $763,158 project to provide in-school
              support  for 25 fourth-grade and 25 fifth-grade teachers in the schools  where
              Project IMPACT has a K-4 research and implementation project  being completed. 
              This is an extension to fifth grade of an on-  going, joint research and
              teacher enhancement project in elementary  mathematics education implementation
              in urban school districts.   The project has conducted intensive teacher
              enhancement for grades  K-3 along with longitudinal data collection on students
              as they  progressed from K through third grade.  This project will continue 
              the project to complete fifth grade with these students and their  teachers. 
              The project has a strong research component focusing on  the issues performance
              and behaviors and beliefs related to  mathematics.  Cost-sharing is 31% of the
              NSF funding request.
