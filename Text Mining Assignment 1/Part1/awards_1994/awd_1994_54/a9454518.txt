Abstract    :
              Miami University Middletown, in partnership with the major chemical  industries
              in Ohio and a regional consortium of two-year and  four-year colleges and high
              schools, is establishing a regional  consortium for Chemical Technology
              Education. By bringing academic  courses into closer touch with today's
              industrial chemistry, the  project is attracting additional students to careers
              in chemistry  and improving the quality of education of chemical technicians.  
              Four categories of activities are envisioned for the project:  1) Curriculum
              Development; 2) Instructional Materials Development;  3) Faculty and Teacher
              Enhancement; and 4) Student Enhancement and  Outreach. High school and college
              faculty are eligible for a  Teacher Industrial Internship Program in which
              participants spend  a summer or part of an academic year working in partner
              industries.  Similarly, master high school teachers and two-year college
              faculty  are working in collaboration with industrial chemists in developing 
              curriculum and instructional  materials. Symposia and special topic  seminars
              are also being organized on a regular basis.  The project  is being built upon
              the nationally known eight-year old Partners  for Terrific Science
              industrial/academic partnership and programs  housed in the Center for Chemical
              Education at Miami University  Middletown, as well as existing collaborative
              efforts of the  consortium members. This project is serving as a model for
              regional  and national development of improved chemical technician education.
