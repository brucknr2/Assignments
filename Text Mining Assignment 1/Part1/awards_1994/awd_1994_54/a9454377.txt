Abstract    :
              9454377  Moreno    This is a three year project which will provide intensive
              staff  development in integrated science, mathematics and technology for 
              three, two teacher teams from 12 elementary schools in Harris  County.  In
              turn, these teams will be lead teachers in their home  districts.  The project
              will involve principals and superintendents  in each of the 12 districts.  The
              project will be accomplished by  (1) involving participating district and
              school administrators,  teachers and parents in the 12 schools; (2) training
              three, two-  teachers teams from each to serve as lead teachers through 
              participation in an intensive four-week integrated science,  mathematics and
              technology institute for three consecutive summers  and through workshops held
              during the school year (two per year);  (3) sponsoring school-year inservice
              sessions for all teachers in  the targeted schools to be conducted by program
              participants; and  (4) providing the teacher teams with additional activities
              and  guidance during the school year to increase the probability of  success in
              achieving sustained improvement in integrated  instruction.    The project will
              result in the professional development of 72  teachers in the areas of science,
              mathematics and technology.   These teachers in turn will provide teacher
              inservice training and  collaboration among their teacher co-workers. 
              Sustained  improvement is expected as trained teachers promote their schools.  
              The project is supported by the 12 superintendents whose schools  are involved.
                 The project requested $699,586 from NSF with institutions/agencies  and
              school districts providing 38% in cost sharing.
