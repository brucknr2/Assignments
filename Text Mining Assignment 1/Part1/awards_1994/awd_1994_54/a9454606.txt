Abstract    :
              Two high-priority national issues that will require a combination  of new
              technological and educational solutions are improving  national competitiveness
              and productivity and dealing with an aging  infrastructure. A key element in
              addressing both issues is a  well-developed continuum of educational and
              training opportunities  that foster collaboration, interaction, and transfer of
              ideas and  technology among all sectors of education, industry, and 
              government. A regional center to improve technological education  and to foster
              improved relationships, communication, cooperation,  and interaction among the
              various sectors of nondestructive  evaluation/nondestructive testing (NDE/NDT)
              education and  technology and their constituencies in the north central United 
              States is being planned. An informal consortium of Iowa State  University
              (Ames), Hutchinson Technical College (Hutchinson,  Minnesota), Moraine Valley
              Community College (Palos Hills,  Illinois), Northeast Iowa Community College
              (Peosta), and Southeast  Community College (Milford, Nebraska) in collaboration
              with  industry, government, professional society, and regional high  school
              partners is involved in this planning initiative. To provide  a model for a
              well-articulated continuum of educational  opportunities in areas of emerging
              technological importance, the  proposed center is designed to build upon the
              established research  accomplishments of the mature Center for NDE and College
              of  Engineering at Iowa State University, some of the leading technical  and
              community college programs in NDT/NDE in the United States, and  selected
              existing educational development and technology transfer  efforts. Programs
              that will provide motivational materials,  instructional modules, curriculum
              materials, workshops, and shared  learning environments among students and
              faculty at all levels from  junior high school through undergraduate
              engineering programs are  being planned.
