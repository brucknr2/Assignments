Abstract    :
              9454816  Coberly    The Metropolitan Tulsa Education Network (MTEN) Task Force,
              composed of representatives  of Tulsa area business, education, and government,
              was formed in 1992 by the Metropolitan  Tulsa Chamber of Commerce to build a
              county-wide electronic network infrastructure to support  all levels of
              education.  The task force is currently developing the technical specifications
              for  the metropolitan area network; undertaking a six-month demonstration
              project connecting a few  schools to the Internet; laying the legal and
              financial groundwork for a multiple school district,  multi-million dollar bond
              issue to fund school technology initiatives; and outlining the structure  of
              the governing authority required to institutionalize the collaborative project.
                 MTEN proposes to use a one-year NIE Planning Grant to prepare the groundwork
              for a strongly  competitive infrastructure proposal in the following year. The
              objectives of this planning exercise  also include:           The refinement of
              a metropolitan area network design.           The formal and legal
              establishment of a collaborative organizational structure to       manage the
              network.           The development of public support for local and state bond
              initiatives which will serve       to secure the long term funding sources
              needed to sustain networking infrastructure.           Conveying the vision of
              the "Information Super Highway" to a large portion of the       public and
              private sectors of the commnnity.     The planning grant proposed herein
              proposes the following tasks to achieve the above objectives:           Offer a
              one day Community Workshop which will heighten the awareness of all      
              segments of the community to the benefits of the network.           Expansion
