                     The PUMP Algebra Project    The Peoria Urban Mathematics Plan (PUMP) is
              a 3.5-year  project to reform the teaching of mathematics in Peoria's  middle
              and high schools, with a special focus on increasing  minority student
              participation in the algebra track (circa  1/2 of Peoria's student population
              is African American).  To  this end, 48 teachers (grades 5-9) are selected (in
              teams of  2-4 from each of Peoria's 12 middle and 4 high schools) to  attend a
              3 sequential summer teacher enhancement program  that focuses on reflective
              pedagogy, and content and  technology enhancement.  Each summer consists of a
              4-week  institute:  Summer 1 focuses on rational numbers and  proportional
              reasoning; Summer 2 looks at algebra, stressing  patterns and functions; Summer
              3 looks in depth at how to  implement PUMP algebra ideas and techniques, and
              integrate  them into the curricula that are in place in the  participants'
              schools.  School year follow-up consists of 6  1/2-day seminars, as well as 4
              site visits by PUMP senior  staff to each participating teacher's classes.  The
              program  involves building principals, and draws on community  resources, such
              as, for example, an existing Urban League  outreach program for elementary
              students.  An external  evaluation, complementing on-going internal
              evaluations,  focuses especially on documenting student change.  To 
              disseminate the project, 4 selected mid-sized cities around  the country send
              observers to the project, and some 70  cities are networked by a project
              newsletter.         Cost sharing is 64% of the NSF contribution.
