Abstract    :
              Hands On Physics represents a major reconsideration of introductory  physics
              which takes full advantage of the powerful insights learned  in that time about
              how students learn and the new opportunities  technologies offer. The material
              developed will targets students  headed for technological careers at the high
              school and two-year  college level. The project is collaboration between a
              small central  staff and practicing teachers and faculty, who are developing, 
              testing, and revising the material in actual classrooms.
