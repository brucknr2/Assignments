Abstract    :
              9454651  Jones                               This project is designed to create
              a Technical Science Academy as  a division within the Amarillo Scientific Arts
              Academy.  The  Academy serves secondary and post-secondary students from
              Amarillo  and the surrounding area through state-of-the-art curricula and 
              laboratories in mathematics, science and technology.  The project  is designed
              to provide a hands-on curricula for majors in  Electronics Engineering
              Technology and Hazardous Materials  Technology.  The project implements a
              seamless educational strand  which removes barriers between secondary and
              post-secondary levels.   Team teaching, proficiency based curricula and
              cooperative learning  are the major emphasis of the project, as well as the 
              implementation of internships, cooperatives and interactions with  industrial
              partners for faculty and students.  The project is  designed to appeal to
              underrepresented groups including women and  minorities.  This project grew out
              of a committee effort which  brought together educators and business/industry
              leaders to  generate realistic ways to address the national education goals in 
              Amarillo Texas.
