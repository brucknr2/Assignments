Abstract    :
              9454589  Hata                                                          The
              Portland Community College - Intel Corporation cooperative  program in
              semiconductor manufacturing education is being  transported to two other sites:
              The Southwestern Indian Polytechnic  Institute and Albuquerque TVI with Intel,
              and Chemeketa Community  College in Oregon with Siltec Silicon. This academic
              program is  characterized by a solid foundation of science, mathematics, and 
              communications skills, along with specialty courses offered using  industry
              facilities. Project activities include curriculum  transfer, faculty
              development, course implementation and updating,  instructional delivery,
              program assessment, and dissemination of  project results. A central feature of
              the project is an annual  three-day workshop at which faculty participants
              collaborate on how  courses should be taught, course content and level, student
               assessment, and specification of best practices identified at the  various
              sites.
