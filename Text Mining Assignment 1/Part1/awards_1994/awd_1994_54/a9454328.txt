Abstract    :
              9454328  Bitter    The Math Discourse Project is a 3-year project at $2,288,631,
               produce to improve the mathematics skills of K-4 Hispanic students  by
              improving the mathematics discourse skills of teachers in both 
              Sheltered-English Classrooms and Two-Way Immersion programs.  The  project will
              produce a CD-ROM multimedia database learning  environment for teachers
              including classroom video, expert  commentary on educational theorists and
              master teachers, and  prepared interactive lessons that guide teachers to
              successful,  long-term application of the teaching standards in their 
              classrooms.  With the help of local staff developers, teachers will  use this
              over two semesters in Arizona and Los Angeles as part of  the formative
              evaluation.  Evaluation of the product with regard to  the NCTM Standards will
              be provided by the National Council of  Teachers of Mathematics.  It is
              anticipated that the final product  will be available through a major
              publisher.  Cost-sharing is  reported at 24%.
