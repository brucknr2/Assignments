Abstract    :
              Image Processing for Teaching (IPT) brings a powerful technology to  schools and
              two-year colleges, where students use this  state-of-the-art tool for
              exploration and analysis, learning  problem-solving skills, computer and
              imaging technologies, and  specific image processing skills, which are becoming
              increasingly  important in the modern work place. IPT's past success at
              exciting  students about science and mathematics, bringing inquiry and 
              discovery-based learning to students of all ability levels, has  created
              considerable demand for implementation in  vocational/technological education
              settings.The IPT project  produces curriculum materials targeting technological
              education  programs. We design and conduct workshops to provide the teaching 
              staff development necessary for successful implementation. IPT  further
              supports implementation with follow-up services, including  toll-free telephone
              and e-mail communication, an annual conference,  and periodic video
              conferences. Our team of expert teachers play a  primary role in all planning,
              development, and instructional  activities. The stream of interdisciplinary
              activities, keyed to  occupational clusters, will keep instructors and their
              students on  the cutting edge of technology, while using a demonstrated
              powerful  tool for learning.
