Abstract    :
              The South Carolina Technical and Comprehensive Education College  System is
              planning for the development of the South Carolina Center  of Excellence for
              Advanced Technological Education.  The purpose of  the Center is to provide
              leadership toward reform for the state,  the south, and the nation in meeting
              the challenges of achieving  success in today's high-technology marketplace,
              specifically in the  areas of advanced science and engineering technology
              education.   The planning objectives are to design systemic approaches for 
              transforming technological education at the two-year college level  including
              the following five major components:  (1)  Teaching/Learning Reform; (2)
              Instructional Technology use; (3)  Faculty Development; (4) Collaboration among
              types of institutions;  and (5) Accountability and Dissemination.Partners
              include all the  two-year colleges in the state of South Carolina, Clemson 
              University, the South Carolina Department of Education, the Academy  for
              Education Development, the South Carolina State Systemic  Initiative, the South
              Carolina Tech Prep Consortium, and numerous  representatives from business and
              industry.
