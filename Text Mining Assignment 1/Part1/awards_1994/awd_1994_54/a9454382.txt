Abstract    :
              9454382  Doherty    This three-year regional and national teacher enhancement
              project  provides grades 6-12 teachers with in-depth physical science, life 
              science and mathematics content.  Regionally, 700 teachers from the  San
              Francisco Unified School District and the San Mateo School  District and 20
              others are included; nationally the project brings  50 TE-workshop providers,
              attending as teams, into the program as  teacher-leaders.  The four integrated
              levels of the project are:         *    a 100-hour introductory Teacher
              Institute where teachers            receive instruction science content as well
              as an            introduction to inquiry based learning,       *    a 90-hour
              Advanced Theme Based Institute with Follow-up            Sessions where
              teachers grapple with issues of theme-            based teaching and
              implementing standards-based systemic            reform,        *    a program
              of Leadership Development for Teacher Leaders            who design and
              implement professional development            workshops in the Bay area and
              around the nation, and        *    follow-up Workshops in all areas plus a
              Teacher            Networking Program to provide an outgoing community of      
                   support.    Each year of the project 4-teachers who are alumni of the
              Teacher  Institute will leave their classrooms for 1-year and become 
              Teachers-In -Residence at the EXPLORATORIUM.  These teachers-In-  Residence
              will work with the EXPLORATORIUM on a long term basis to  sustain the Teacher
              Institutes.
