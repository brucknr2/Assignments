Abstract    :
              This project is developing instructional materials including print  and video,
              laboratory materials, and faculty guides to be used in  the education of
              environmental technicians.  The project is being  carried out in cooperation
              with the Partnership for Environmental  Technology Education (PETE) and Van
              Nostrand Reinhold Publishers.  The material to be generated covers eight
              content areas: (1)  Introduction to Environmental Technology; (2) Waster
              Generation,  Reduction, Treatment, and Prevention; (3) Basics of Toxicology;
              (4)  Basics of Industrial Hygiene; (5) Site Characterization, Sampling,  and
              Field Analysis; (6) Environmental and Hazardous Materials  Regulations; (7)
              Contingency Planning and Reporting for Emergency  Response; and (8) Safety and
              Emergency Response.  The primary  audiences for the modules are two-year
              community and technical  college students throughout the United States.
              Linkages are being  established, however, which will make Preserving The Legacy
               accessible to secondary school students, as well as students  attending
              four-year colleges and universities.
