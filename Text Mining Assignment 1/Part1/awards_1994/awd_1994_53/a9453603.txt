Abstract    :
              The University of North Carolina at Greensboro will arrange  summer research
              internships for 10 middle-grades education  majors and 10 experienced
              middle-school science or  mathematics teachers in faculty research
              laboratories.  Preservice and in service interns will work in pairs so that 
              the preservice students can benefit from the classroom  experience of their
              service partners as they assimilate the  significance of their research
              experience for the practice  of teaching.  A series of meetings will be held
              during the  summer to facilitate this assimilation.  During the same  summer, a
              working group of discipline faculty, education  faculty and middle-school
              teachers will develop a two-  semester interdisciplinary courses entitled "The
              Nature of  Science and Mathematics."  The preservice participants will  take
              this course during the following academic year, when  they will also complete
              their student teaching in the  Guilford County Schools.  Every effort will be
              made to place  student teachers in the classrooms of their research  internship
              partners.  Assessment of the graduates' first  semester of independent teaching
              will be carried out in the  following fall semester to examine the effect of
              the  research experience and the  interdisciplinary course on  their teaching
              of science and mathematics in the middle-  school classroom.
