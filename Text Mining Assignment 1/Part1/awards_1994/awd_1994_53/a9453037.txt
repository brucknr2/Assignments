Abstract    :
              9453037  McLean    The Exploratorium will develop a hands-on, interactive,
              traveling  exhibit "Garden of Complexity: Self-Organization in Nature."  
              "Using the metaphor of a garden (a universally appreciated symbol  of beauty
              and contemplation)" and arguing "that the essence of  science is to extract
              organized observations from the complexity of  nature," this exhibit will allow
              visitors to observe some of the  self-organizing systems in a quiet,
              contemplative environment.  The  exhibit will be about pattern and how the
              natural world emerges  into states that are perceived as pattered or organized.
               Four  sub-sets of this theme will be explored; organization into  patterns;
              surface effects - rubbing and flow; rotation,  circulation, vortices, and the
              granular state - a different state  of matter.    Both existing and new
              artworks/activities will be used in this  exhibit.  The new additions will be
              created by individuals in the  Exploratorium's Artists-in-Residence program. 
              Their creations are  both aesthetically and educationally interesting.  In
              addition, the  exhibit developers will experiment with new techniques in
              exhibit  interpretation and they will develop activities that provide  linkages
              with formal education.  The exhibit will be circulated by  the Association of
              Science and Technology Centers to nine sites  over a three year period.  It is
              estimated that it will reach 2.5  million  people.
