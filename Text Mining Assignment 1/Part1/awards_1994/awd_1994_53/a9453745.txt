Abstract    :
              9453745  Warlick    The University of Texas at Austin intends to organize a
              national  workshop to bring together the representatives of all state 
              departments of education and their network stakeholders,  representatives from
              pertinent Federal Agencies concerned with K-12  educational network initiatives
              as well as representives from  various national professional education
              associations.  These  representatives will meet to develop a means for
              collaboration and  long-range planning for the integration of an information 
              infrastructure to support the needs of the K-12 educational  community.  The
              state representatives and their colleagues will  articulate the issues and
              provide feedback to clarify the current  status of state educational
              networking.  The workshop will provide  a forum to establish a clear
              understanding of needs and provide  insight to explore how federal and state
              regulations, policies, and  private sector partnerships can leverage current
              educational reform  initiatives to support the development of a National
              Information  Infrastructure for Education.  In addition, the electronic forum 
              will provide continual support for the cadre of individuals as they  work to
              develop and strengthen educational networking initiatives  in their own
              communities.  ***
