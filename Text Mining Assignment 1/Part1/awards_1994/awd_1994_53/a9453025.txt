Abstract    :
              9453025  MacNeice    ABSTRACT     Washington Independent Writers is engaged in a
              planning phase toward publication of Quest?, a 4-page, tabloid sized newspaper
              about science, technology, and society for children and their families.  The
              target audience is children age 8 to 16, with a focus on the 10-14 year-old age
              group, along with their parents, teachers, and counselors.  A prototype version
              of the paper has been published locally and distributed through Safeway stores.
                  During the planning phase, the PI and staff will conduct the following
              activities:    o Conduct front-end evaluation of the target audience with
              particular emphasis being given to identifying ways to reach underserved and
              underrepresented groups.    o Work with science, technology, and graphics
              experts to improve the quality of the content and design.    o Explore
              traditional and new distribution mechanisms and cooperative arrangements.    o
              Create and test interdisciplinary procedures for evaluation.    o Establish a
              network of individual, community, corporate, and institutional supporters,
              including educators, community leaders, scientists, and engineers.    o Create
              linkages with schools and school programs.    o Explore funding sources and
              sponsorships.    o Continue building a Board of Advisors.
