Abstract    :
              9453116  Saltman    This Local Systemic Change Through Teacher Enhancement
              project is  the result of a collaboration between the National School  District
              and the University of California, San Diego (USCD).  The  project will combine
              the resources of the school district, USCD,  private industry, and the
              community to institute and support an  integrated, inquiry-based, hands-on
              science curriculum in all  National City elementary schools.  The curriculum to
              be  implemented will include NSF funded FOSS and EDC-Insights  materials as
              instructional modules for grades K-6.    Each year 60 lead teachers will attend
              a four week inservice  program.  The institute will be held in conjunction with
              a  district wide summer enrichment program that will allow a  practicum for the
              lead teachers.  The summer leadership institute  will be staffed by university
              scientists, science educators, and  master teachers from a previous NSF funded
              project.  Parent and  community members will be enlisted to assist in both
              managing and  maintaining the instructional materials.  This cadre of 60 lead 
              teachers will form a science leadership team at each school site  to oversee
              continuing science education reform.  They will  provide full day staff
              development programs and weekly school  year selected inservice programs for
              350 participants.  Staff and  parent volunteers will attend six Saturday
              academic year sessions  and receive university extension credit from UCSD for
              their  participation.    Cost sharing is 31% of the total NSF requested budget.
