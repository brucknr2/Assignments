Abstract    :
              9453055  Casjens    The Utah Museum of Natural History at the University of Utah
              will  use this planning grant to plan an exhibit called "Canyon Through  Time;
              Reverse Archaeology in the Grand Gulch Region."  They will  use the knowledge
              and viewpoint of the several living cultures  concerned in telling this story
              looking at the past, the present,  and the future.  Breaking from the tradition
              of presenting only the  archaeologist's "voice" in an exhibit, they will have
              different  "voices."  Their goal is to give both the local Native Americans 
              and scientists the opportunity to tell the story as they see it.   The planning
              grant will give them the opportunity to bring together  individuals
              representing this diversity of viewpoint to establish  the script of the
              exhibit.  The project has the potential for  serving as a model for others
              developing exhibits and projects on  archaeological and anthropological themes
              where it is valuable to  bring together this diversity of perspectives.
