Abstract    :
              ESI 94-53892  Deborah Bryant  Educational Development Center  Newton, MA   
              Associates in Residence at EDC    EDC seeks to address the problem of
              broadening the base of  mathematics educators who can design and then execute 
              successful teacher enhancement projects--especially projects  originating from
              ethnic and geographic communities hitherto  under-served by NSF.  To this end,
              EDC plans to develop an  "associates-in-residence" program that would allow 
              mathematics educators to spend a non-trivial period of time  at EDC in order to
              observe and participate in the life of  some of EDC's on-going teacher
              enhancement projects .  Such  a residential program would serve to provide the
              associates  with both the intellectual, as well as the "nuts and bolts" 
              background needed to design and direct viable projects of  their own. The
              present project is a 6-month planning project  that includes a small pilot
              version of such a program.   The  project invites 2 mathematics educators from
              under-  represented and under-served groups to spend 5 weeks at EDC  during
              Summer 1994 to observe and participate in the work of  3 of its teacher
              enhancement projects.  In addition, project  staff provides support to the 2
              associates in designing  their own projects, and writing proposals to fund
              them.    The in-kind contributions from non-NSF sources equal 8% of  NSF's
              contribution.
