              1994/95                                ABSTRACT              KCTS has received
              support for the production and outreach  for the second season of "Bill Nye the
              Science Guy."  Each  program in the 39 program series will focus on a single
              science  theme developed around two or three learning outcomes and is 
              presented with a fast and colorful pace and style suited for  today's
              generation of nine and ten year old viewers.  The host,  Bill Nye, joins
              viewers and guests as they explore science topics  in his laboratories and in
              field locations.  Children also will  perform on-camera experiments in a home
              setting.  In most shows,  guest scientists and celebrities, selected to ensure
              a diverse  representation, will be featured.  Segments in the programs 
              include:           "Check it Out"             a small experiment performed in
              the                           lab or at home by child actors.    "Try This at
              Home"         an experiment viewers may attempt                           at
              home after receiving instructions on                           the air.    "Way
              Cool Scientist"       a scientist demonstrating his or                         
               her work as it relates to the topic of                           the program. 
                "Music Video Parody"       video tailored to popular music                   
                     genres such as rap or "grunge" or pop                           music.  
               "Consider the Following" Bill presents a concept to the viewer                
                        in a one on one segment.    "Big Demonstration"        Bill, in the
              laboratory, uses                           equipment to demonstrate an element
              of                           the theme.    "Celebrity Cameos"         featuring
              both teen and adult                           celebrities with a high
              recognition                           factor.    "Fake commercials"        
              like the music videos, humor ous                           parodies of
              advertising.                                         Outreach for the second
              season will include a quarterly  newsletter to be mailed to viewers homes. 
              This eight page  newsletter will include regular columns such as "Ask Bill" and
               "Try this at Home."  It will be designed to appeal to children  ages 8 to 12
              and will contain a column for parents.  During the  second season, at-home
              science kits will again be available to  viewers.  These free kits will enable
              children and their families  to perform scientific experiments together at
              home.              The video series will be produced by McKenna/Gottlieb 
              Producers Inc. and KCTS Television and will be syndicated for  broadcast by
              Buena Vista Television (the syndication division of  Disney Productions).  The
              second season also will be broadcast  daily on PBS.  This will give the series
              a presence on both  public broadcasting and on commercial television in many
              markets.  Buena Vista Television will provide $3,000,000 toward the  production
              budget and PBS will provide $2,000,000 for production.  KCTS is seeking a
              corporate underwriter to provide $1,000,000 for  additional outreach and
              promotion.         Elizabeth Brock of KCTS will be Executive in Charge of the 
              project.  Bill Nye is the principal science writer for the series  as well as
              host of the series.  The series producers will be  Erren Gottlieb and James E.
              McKenna.  These four people will  serve as Co-PI's of the project. The advisory
              committee consists  of scientists, science educators, evaluators, and
              curriculum  developers.  Members include:  H. Prentice Baptiste, Arthur B. 
              Ellis, Caroline Herzenberg, Gilbert S. Omenn, Senta A. Raizen,  Matthew H.
              Schneps, Paul H. Williams, Carole Ann Kubota, and  Sally Luttrell-Montes.
