Abstract    :
              9453669  Cohen  The Dade County Public Schools (DCPS) Urban Systemic Initiative 
              (USI) plans to achieve significant improvement in mathematics and  science
              learning and achievement by focusing on four systemic  strands: content and
              instruction; school improvement;  administrative/school management policies;
              and community  involvement.  Each strand focuses respectively on implementing 
              policy reform and sustained support in the classroom, the school  and the
              district, and on collaboration with community partners.  The four strands
              collectively will impact all professionals and  students involved in the
              mathematics and science learning process  in Dade County.  Specific leadership
              roles for teachers, and  clear plans for incorporating Chapter I resources and 
              accomplishment buttress the plan.  The Initiative calls for  active hands-on,
              inquiry based instruction and high achievement  expectations in mathematics and
              science for all students. It  proposes to sustain success through on-going
              quality assessments  using  well-qualified leadership, and a vigilant focus on 
              incremental and continuous change over time. Continuous  collaboration with the
              Community Leadership Council and the  District USI Policy Team will lead to
              development of strategies  to overcome barriers to sustained long-term
              improvement.
