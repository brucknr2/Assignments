Abstract    :
              9453806  Curwood    The program producers at the World Media Foundation seek
              $550,000  over three years  to produce and present to listeners vital stories 
              about scientific inquiry and technological developments related to 
              environmental change.  These presentations, entitled Living on  Earth, are
              broadcast weekly on more that 240 National Public Radio  member stations in the
              United States.  The producer intends to  develop the program into a one-hour
              format from the current 30  minute broadcast.  Audience participation will be
              encouraged  through call-in question and answer sessions about science and 
              ecology.
