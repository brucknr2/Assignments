Abstract    :
              9453811  Henry    The Please Touch Museum is requesting $684,602 for the
              development  of educational resource materials in science and mathematics for 
              four-year old children, and training for their parents and teachers  in Head
              Start and other daycare programs.  This 44 month project  will develop, test,
              and produce six materials-based science and  math activity kits, science
              training workshops for parents and  daycare educators, and related family
              materials and events.  It  will culminate in a national dissemination program
              to promote more  effective preschool science and math education through
              materials-  based science inquiry and increased professional relations between 
              educators in youth museums and daycare centers.
