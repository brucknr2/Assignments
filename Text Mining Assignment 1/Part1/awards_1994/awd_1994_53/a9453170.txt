Abstract    :
              9453170  Oakey    The Community Partners for Project-Based Teaching and Learning
              are  planning for the development of an initiative that will:  (1)  demonstrate
              that students whose teachers use project-based learning  as a strategy for
              teaching math, science, and technology education  will show improved academic
              achievement, (2) develop the means for  connecting the work of discrete
              enhancement projects nationwide so  that the maximum number of teachers and
              students can benefit from  these exemplary, ongoing efforts, and (3) impact
              preservice  teachers so that these improvements become the norm, rather than 
              the reform of classroom practice.  This planning grant will result  in an
              implementation plan for the Community Partners initiative.  ***
