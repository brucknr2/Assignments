Abstract    :
              9453031  Schneider    The Children's Museum of Manhatten is requesting $267,220
              over two  years to create a 2,500 sq.ft. interactive exhibition about the 
              physical and acoustic properties of sound.  The exhibition will use  music as a
              high-interest point of entry into learning about  science, and also as a
              demonstration of science as part of our  everyday lives.  The entire exhibit
              will be displayed for two  years.  Certain elements will then be retired,
              others displayed  indefinitely.    Target audience is children in kindergarten
              through sixth grades.
