Abstract    :
              Title: Memphis Curriculum Reform Initiative  The University of Memphis, a state
              supported comprehensive university, and LeMoyn-Owen College, a private,
              historically African American undergraduate institution, are organizing a
              workshop  and  ancillary  activities for faculty  members of the two
              institutions to develop ways to incorporate  and illustrate exemplary teaching
              methods in the science content and pedagogy courses taken by future elementary
              school teachers at the two institutions.  The content courses are taken by a
              wide range of  students in addition to those planning careers in teaching. 
              Opportunities are provided for input and  evaluation of the resulting changes
              by in-service teachers and two year college faculty as well as by current 
              undergraduate students who have recently completed the unmodified courses.  In
              its initial phase a group of  science and pedagogy faculty are meeting toreview
              pertinent research literature and to identify four or more individuals to be
              brought to the workshops as discussion and activity leaders.  After the
              workshop participants will serve as change agents within their own departments.
                Assessment will include an ethnographic study of cultural changes  among the
              teaching  faculties of the two institutions.
