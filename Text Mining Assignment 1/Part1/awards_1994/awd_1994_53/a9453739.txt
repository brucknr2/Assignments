Abstract    :
              9453739  Riehl  South Seattle Community College, Boeing Company, Eldec
              Corporation,  Clover Park Technical College and 12 other organizations will 
              develop a process for determining specific workplace standards for 
              manufacturing education and training in Washington State.  These  standards
              will, in turn, lead to an industry-guided manufacturing  technology core
              curriculum.  The curriculum will begin in high  schools and will feed into a
              2+2 Tech Prep post-secondary community  college program.  A workplace-based
              internship will also be an  integral part of the curriculum.  This
              comprehensive, innovative  proposal has strong support from both labor unions
              and industry.   It will help bridge the gap between secondary school technical 
              education and the requirements of the industrial workforce.
