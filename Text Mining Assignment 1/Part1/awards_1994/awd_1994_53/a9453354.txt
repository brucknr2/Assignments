Abstract    :
                                        ABSTRACT    AST-9453354  Woodward, Charles E    The 
              observational program will focus on the temporal  study  of  novae  from  both 
              ground-based and airborne  platforms.  Novae  offer tantalizing clues to the
              end points of  stellar  evolution   and  chemical  enrichment  of  the 
              interstellar  medium.   Spectroscopy  of  novae yields  information  about 
              temperatures,   elemental  abundances,  chemical   anomaties  related  to
              nucleosynthesis, the mass of dust and  gas,  and  dynamical  properties of the
              ejecta.  Determination  of  the  metal  abundances from these observations will
               clarify  how  novae  contribute  to the galactic 22Na and  26Al  abundance 
              anomalies.    Because   many  terrestrial   meteorites   are  overabundant  in 
              these  isotopes,  studies  of  how   novae  contribute  to  galactic 
              enrichment  processes   will   aid  understanding of solar system formation.  *
