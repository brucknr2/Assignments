Abstract    :
              9453043  Lemme  The Philadelphia USI (PUSI) is designed as a series of vertical
              networks, each of which is built  upon a community of students, teachers,
              principals, staff and parents centered upon one of the  district's 22 K-12
              elementary-to-high school feeder pattern clusters.  These networks are linked 
              by cross-cluster (city-wide) networks of discrete interest groups (science
              teachers, mathematics  teachers, technology specialists, principals) and by
              district-wide community partnerships.  The  PUSI seeks to: (1) implement a
              national standards-based K-12 MST curriculum delivered  through instructional
              methods which actively involve students in their own learning; (2) enact  a
              systemic professional development program incorporating extant NSF-funded
              programs,  university partners and school site-based professional development
              that employs mentor teachers;  (3) produce an extensive student support
              services network developed in conjunction with the  Philadelphia Comprehensive
              Regional Center for Minorities, local informal science institutions  and other
              community partners; (4) begin the use of performanae-based student assessment
              to  complement traditional assessments; (5) develop parent and community
              partnerships in support  of MST education; and (6) work with the Philadelphia
              "NSF Collaborative for Excellence in  Teacher Preparation" to produce future
              teachers whose abilities and attitudes complement USI  objectives and goals.
