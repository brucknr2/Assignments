Abstract    :
              9453862  Smith        The District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS)
              Mathematics, Science and  Technology Initiative seeks to provide the
              mathematics and science  fundamentals which will permit all students to
              participate fully in a  technological society and to enable a significantly
              greater number of these  students to pursue careers in mathematics, science,
              engineering or technology.   To reach these goals, DCPS proposes to carry out a
              four part program to: (1)  produce and implement a national-standards-based
              mathematics, science and  technology (MST) K-12 curriculum; (2) establish an
              extensive professional  development program for teachers and administrators to
              change the culture of  the classroom by use of exciting, hands-on
              student-centered instruction; (3)  establish demonstration schools at each
              educational level to be used for  constant refinement and dissemination of
              "best practices' in MST education;  and (4) link community organizations,
              science-rich institutions and other  partners with the DCPS in support of K-12
              MST education.  The reform will  be coordinated by the District's Center for
              Systemic Educational Change,  through its MST Resource Team which is led by the
              Deputy Superintendent,  DCPS.  ***
