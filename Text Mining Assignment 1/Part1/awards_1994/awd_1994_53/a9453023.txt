Abstract    :
              9453023  Taylor    The American Museum of Natural History is developing a 10,000
              sq.  ft. Hall of Life's Diversity that will interpret biodiversity, what  it
              is, why it matters to humans, why it is under threat, and what  can be done to
              mitigate the current pattern of extinctions.  The  hall will have the following
              sections: a) the Crisis Center that  will serve as the orientation place for
              the exhibit and where the  core principles of the exhibit will be interpreted,
              b) four  interactive habitat models that depict major ecosystems, c) the 
              Spectrum of Life, in which specimens, models, photographs, and  interactive
              multimedia will be juxtaposed and will serve as a field  guide to the array of
              animal and plant life on the planet, d) a  Resource Center that is devoted to
              educational activities, and e)  a theater/classroom space.  The intended
              audience for the exhibit  is people of all ages and learning styles.  The
              exhibit will  illuminate the crucial role that science plays in our everyday 
              lives and will promote science literacy among adults and children.   In
              addition to the main exhibit, there will be a broad menu of  complementary
              programming including traveling versions of the  exhibit, a teacher resource
              guide, and a teacher-training  institute.  The exhibit and complementary
              activities are to be  coordinated with New York State's State Systemic
              Initiative  program.
