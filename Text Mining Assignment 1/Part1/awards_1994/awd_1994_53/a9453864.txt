Abstract    :
                To understand how students constructs mathematical ideas in  "Dynamic
              Geometry" environments (tools like Geometer's Sketchpad  and Cabri), one needs
              clear characterizations of : (1) the  mathematical "raw materials" embodied in
              the software and (2) how  students use these "raw materials."  What are the
              mathematical  objects and allowable transformations?  Which do they notice and 
              attend to?  How do they interpret what they notice?  Through interviews with
              developers, and through our won analyses,  we will investigate the tools'
              mathematical and pedagogical  potential.  Experiments and clinical interviews
              with students well  lead to a preliminary epistemology of concepts related to
              the  defining feature of this software: dynamic "dragging."  focussed 
              experiments will then reexamine these results and hone them, to  derive
              implications for learning and teaching, and for the design  of materials.  Thus
              the project will establish empirical and  theoretical foundations for an
              epistemology of dynamic geometry.
