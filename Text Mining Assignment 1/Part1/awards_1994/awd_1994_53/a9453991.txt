Abstract    :
                The University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) is ideally  suited for an
              integrative and multidisciplinary graduate training  program in coastal ocean
              processes.  Ten faculty including 4  physical/optical oceanographers, 4
              biological oceanographers and 2  chemical/paleooceanographers who already have
              an established record  of productive collaboration are seeking support for 5
              graduate  traineeships.  A sixth student will be supported by matching funds 
              from the University.  The training program will emphasize two  highly
              interdisciplinary areas crucial to our understanding of the  coastal ocean made
              possible by UCSB's unique location and research  expertise; 1) bio-optics,
              photoadaptation, and remote sensing of  coastal primary production and water
              column optical properties (5  faculty) and 2) spatial and temporal variability
              in coastal  hydrography and water column processes and their impact on the 
              long-term climate record deposited in the sediments (8 faculty).   Students
              will be co-sponsored by two faculty to foster  interdisciplinary thesis
              projects and will received training in  state-of-the-art technologies including
              satellite imaging and  remote sensing, ocean mooring instrumentation,
              bio-optics, computer  modeling, and modern isotope geochemical, microbiological
              and  chemical techniques.  Recruitment of women and minority students  will be
              facilitated by liaisons with 2 feeder institutions, (Moss  Landing Marine Lab,
              California State University at Long Beach) and  by the availability of 3 women
              mentors among the participating  faculty.
